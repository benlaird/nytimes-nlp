            "full_text": " Trump Has an Iran Strategy. This Is It. A campaign of\n maximum pressure could bring Tehran to the table. By Richard Goldberg Mr. \nGoldberg served on President Trump\u2019s National Security Council. President \nTrump\u2019s strategy to confront Iran is easy to understand: impose maximum pressure\n to gain maximum leverage ahead of negotiations to dismantle its nuclear program\n and address its malign activities \u2014 all while avoiding a military entanglement \nor pursuing a policy of regime change. Iran\u2019s leaders, for their part, recognize\n that Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy has already sent their economy into a tailspin and \ncould bring down their regime if sanctions are not soon lifted. The recent \nregime-perpetrated murder of about 1,500 Iranian protesters demonstrating \nagainst the government\u2019s austerity policy revealed a destabilized Islamic \nRepublic increasingly afraid of its repressed citizens. The Iranian regime \ndoesn\u2019t need to trust America or Mr. Trump to strike a deal; it just needs to \nact as a rational actor to avoid collapse. Unlike the 2015 Iran deal, which was \na fragile nonbinding political agreement subject to the ebb and flow of American\n politics, Trump could offer to submit a binding treaty to the Senate for \nratification. Tehran\u2019s conventional options are limited because it cannot win a \ndirect military confrontation with the United States. So instead the regime \npursues headline-grabbing provocations to foment political debate in open \ndemocracies \u2014 in Europe and the United States \u2014 while avoiding direct military \nretaliation. The list of Iranian provocations over the past year includes the \ndowning of an American drone, mine attacks on ships in the Strait of Hormuz and \na cruise missile strike on Saudi oil facilities. On the nuclear front, Iran\u2019s \nslow but steady effort to shrink its breakout timeline raises alarm bells in \nWestern capitals without provoking an American or Israeli military strike on its\n nuclear facilities. Each of these escalation points appear designed to bait Mr.\n Trump into reinforcing the false narrative that there are only two choices when\n it comes to Iran: war, or a return to the flawed 2015 nuclear deal. If Iran \ncould make war seem imminent, so the thought goes, it might indirectly force Mr.\n Trump into relieving sanctions (assuring the regime\u2019s survival), perhaps even \nwithout entering direct negotiations. To his credit, President Trump recognized \nthose traps for what they were and exercised strategic patience. Indeed, Mr. \nTrump could have responded to each provocation with a proportional military \nresponse. After a day of flag waving, the national mood might well have shifted \nagainst Mr. Trump, forcing him to offer sanctions relief prematurely without \nachieving any long-term national security objectives. This may indeed have been \nwhat Qassim Suleimani thought he would achieve following the killing of an \nAmerican contractor and an attack on the United States embassy in Iraq. Instead,\n Mr. Trump surprised Iran by striking its top terror strategist, and then \nsurprised it once again by responding to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile retaliation \nwith a return to strategic patience. Mr. Trump emerges from the past few weeks \nin a stronger position. The maximum pressure campaign remains fully intact with \npolitical space to increase the sanctions pressure even further. Iran faces a \nbacklash at home and abroad after its downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet. Mr. \nTrump\u2019s critics who warned that his policies would spark a third world war now \nseem to have gotten ahead of themselves. Many wrongly believe the United States \nhas already reached full \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran. In truth, several critical \npressure points remain untapped. The administration this month rolled out fresh \nsanctions targeting Iran\u2019s construction, mining and manufacturing sectors, along\n with the first step in a crackdown on violators of American sanctions on \nIranian metals and petrochemicals. Sanctions targeting Iranian state shipping \nlines are set to take effect in June and could be expedited for more immediate \nimpact. Another potential target: Iran\u2019s financial sector in its entirety. In \n2018, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin,\n proposed legislation imposing sanctions on Iran\u2019s financial sector, which the \nUnited States recently determined to be a \u201cprimary jurisdiction of money-\nlaundering concern.\u201d The effect could be destabilizing, immediately cutting off \nall non-sanctioned banks inside Iran from international commerce, forcing their \ndisconnection from the global financial messaging system known as SWIFT and \nrendering all remaining foreign exchange reserves held outside Iran inaccessible\n for any purpose. Additional steps could be taken to deprive Iran of the \nstrategic benefits still enjoyed under the nuclear deal and related United \nNations Security Council resolution \u2014 particularly, the scheduled lifting of key\n restrictions on its nuclear program, missile development and conventional arms \ntransfers. Iran\u2019s recent expansion of uranium enrichment coupled with its \nconsistently violent behavior provides the United States and Europe with ample \npretext to trigger the deal\u2019s \u201csnapback\u201d clause, which would restore prior \nSecurity Council resolutions on Iran and eliminate a key disincentive to an \nIranian decision to negotiate. The United Kingdom, France and Germany \u2014 the Iran\n deal\u2019s European contingent \u2014 recently initiated the process to do just that. To\n be sure, it\u2019s possible that Iran\u2019s supreme leader will never authorize direct \nnegotiations with the United States, even in the face of his regime\u2019s imminent \neconomic collapse and international political isolation. But if Mr. Trump can \nsucceed in achieving true maximum pressure and restoring international \nrestrictions on Iran, a phone call from Tehran agreeing to negotiate without \npreconditions could likely follow. Richard Goldberg (@rich_goldberg), a senior \nadviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, most recently served as \nthe National Security Council\u2019s director for countering Iranian weapons of mass \ndestruction.

            "full_text": " Scandalize! Minimize! Repeat as Necessary Right-wing \nmedia have been laying the groundwork for Trump\u2019s acquittal for half a century. \nBy Nicole Hemmer Ms. Hemmer is the author of \u201cMessengers of the Right: \nConservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics.\u201d If you tuned in\n to Fox News to watch the opening arguments of the impeachment trial on \nWednesday night, you were out of luck. Oh, the trial was still technically being\n broadcast on the network, but it had been reduced to a muted box on the side of\n the screen, while Sean Hannity assured viewers, \u201cNone of this will matter.\u201d \nThis was the purest representation so far of conservative media\u2019s efforts to \nminimize not just impeachment but the full array of President Trump\u2019s \nmisconduct. But minimization is only half the strategy to protect Republican \ncontrol of the White House. The other half is scandalization: an effort to \ncreate an air of nonstop scandal around previous Democratic presidents and \npresidential hopefuls. In a recent op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Karl Rove \nargued that Democrats were hypocrites for impeaching Donald Trump. After all, he\n wrote, President Barack Obama once asked for \u201cflexibility\u201d from Russian leaders\n during the 2012 campaign and Democrats neither censured nor impeached him for \nit. (And, he mused, they likely wouldn\u2019t have impeached a President Hillary \nClinton for using an opposition research firm that relied on Russian sources \neither.) These twin tactics are not inventions of the Trump era. They are part \nof a decades-long strategy by the right to secure political power \u2014 a strategy \noriginating in conservative media. In that sense, right-wing media have been \nlaying the groundwork for Trump\u2019s acquittal for half a century. Conservative \nmedia have been scandal-mongering about Democratic presidents ever since modern \nconservative media began taking shape in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Some of\n the earliest books from conservative publishing houses blamed President \nFranklin Roosevelt for the attack on Pearl Harbor: George Morgenstern\u2019s \u201cPearl \nHarbor: The Story of the Secret War\u201d and Robert A. Theobald\u2019s \u201cThe Final Secret \nof Pearl Harbor,\u201d both put out by the conservative publishing house Devin-Adair,\n as well as \u201cAdmiral Kimmel\u2019s Story\u201d from Regnery Publishing. President Harry \nTruman received the same treatment. In 1956, Regnery published Jules Abels\u2019s \n\u201cThe Truman Scandals,\u201d which claimed to reveal \u201cthe record of the most corrupt \nAdministration in American history.\u201d A review of the book in National Review \nconcluded, \u201cCompared with the moral degeneracy of the Truman regime, the \nscandals of the Grant and Harding Administrations are reduced to the semblance \nof quaint and venal peccadilloes.\u201d But it was President Lyndon Johnson who came \nin for the most brutal attacks, primarily for the sin of running against the \nconservative darling Senator Barry Goldwater. Books that centered on Johnson\u2019s \nadvisers \u2014 like Bobby Baker, caught up in a series of bribery and tax evasion \ncharges \u2014 had trouble gaining traction, even though Mr. Goldwater brought it up \nregularly on the campaign trail. One book, though, found an avid conservative \naudience: \u201cA Texan Looks at Lyndon.\u201d J. Evetts Haley, a Texas rancher, self-\npublished the book in 1964. In it, he offered unsubstantiated accounts of \nbribery, stolen elections and even convenient deaths that helped pave Johnson\u2019s \nroad to the White House. As I wrote in The Atlantic in 2014, Mr. Haley\u2019s \nconspiracy theories could have easily been pulled from a 1990s anti-Clinton \nscreed. He called Johnson an \u201cinordinately vain, egotistical, ambitious \nextrovert\u201d and claimed that Lady Bird Johnson mirrored \u201cLady Macbeth\u2019s consuming\n ambition for the growth of her husband\u2019s power.\u201d About the presidential \nassassination that put Johnson in the Oval Office, he hinted darkly, \u201cWhat a \nstrange coincidence.\u201d This was exactly the kind of book conservative donors and \nreaders wanted. With a boost from bulk purchases \u2014 the kind that often propel \nright-wing books onto best-seller lists \u2014 some seven million copies of \u201cA Texan \nLooks at Lyndon\u201d were in circulation by September 1964. Johnson won the election\n in one of the largest landslides in American presidential history. But the \nscandal-mongering mattered. In the early 1970s, when the next Republican \npresident was under investigation for corruption and abuse of power, the \nmonstrous image of Johnson that conservative media helped to paint became part \nof President Richard Nixon\u2019s defense. Conservative media figures did their best \nto downplay Nixon\u2019s crimes, especially in relation to Johnson\u2019s. Nixon himself \ncalled Watergate \u201ca crappy little thing\u201d in his private (but secretly recorded) \nOval Office conversations. Henry Regnery dismissed the accounts of Watergate, \nwriting, \u201cI can see no grounds for impeachment, or even to get worked up about.\u201d\n National Review called the crimes \u201cobjectively trivial\u201d and dismissed \u201cthe \nmedia\u2019s daily spasms of moral indignation\u201d as \u201ca gleeful put-on.\u201d Even after \nNixon had resigned, the magazine still argued that he had been persecuted for \nactions far less serious than Johnson\u2019s. Hedging even as they accused, the \nmagazine\u2019s editors pointed to \u201cthe belief, though not the proof, that Lyndon \nJohnson greatly surpassed Nixon in venality.\u201d After running through the litany \nof Johnson\u2019s sins, the editors expressed hope that one day people would look \nmore kindly on Nixon \u201cas the shady deals of previous presidents become known.\u201d \nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the conservative media sphere was quite small: a handful\n of publishers, magazines and radio programs. The activists behind those outlets\n could influence politics, but they did not have the totalizing power that would\n allow them to ignore the world outside of the conservative movement. They could\n not persuade the vast majority of Americans that Johnson was notoriously \ncorrupt, nor shrink Watergate hearings into a small box on the screen and \npropagandize over it. The rapid expansion of conservative media in the 1990s and\n 2000s, and the conservative scandal machine that powered it, transformed \nAmerican politics. During the Bill Clinton era, new scandal-mongering magazines \nand websites made up what Hillary Clinton accurately called a \u201cvast right-wing \nconspiracy.\u201d What followed was a cynical, partisan impeachment that treated the \nserious constitutional remedy as just another political game. In so doing, \nRepublicans diminished the significance of impeachment, making it less likely \nthe public would take the current impeachment crisis seriously. The Clinton \nimpeachment showed that the Republican Party was fully on board with the \nconservative media\u2019s scandalization project. The whole thing was tawdry, and yet\n two years later the Republicans controlled the presidency and both houses of \nCongress. Scandalization worked, so they returned to it again and again. Even \nRepublican presidential candidates got in on the act, as when President Trump \nled rallygoers in chants of \u201cLock her up.\u201d Soon it was not just presidents but \ncandidates getting the scandal treatment. Regnery Publishing put out John E. \nO\u2019Neill and Jerome R. Corsi\u2019s \u201cUnfit for Command\u201d in 2004 to discredit the \nDemocratic nominee, Senator John Kerry. The accusations that Mr. Kerry had \nexaggerated his service to accumulate medals aired across conservative media and\n surfaced at the 2004 convention, where delegates wore bandages with purple \nhearts drawn on them to mock Mr. Kerry\u2019s war service. Thrilled with the success \nof that book, Mr. Corsi followed it in 2008 with \u201cThe Obama Nation,\u201d a mash-up \nof anti-Obama conspiracy theories. \u201cThe goal is to defeat Obama,\u201d he told The \nTimes in an interview that year. But even before that book hit the shelves, \nconspiracy theories about Senator Obama had already taken flight. Conservative \nmedia treated everything from his birthplace to his religion to his work as a \ncommunity organizer as a career-ending scandal. The pace rapidly escalated once \nhe took office, as shown by the endless, expensive Benghazi investigations \n(which, as a bonus, also damaged the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary \nClinton). Even as right-wing media tried to brand the Obama presidency as the \nmost corrupt administration in the history of the United States, a cottage-\nindustry of scandalmongers had already popped up to attack future Democratic \nnominees. Dinesh D\u2019Souza followed his book \u201cThe Roots of Obama\u2019s Rage\u201d with a \ndocumentary called \u201cHillary\u2019s America,\u201d which depicted Mrs. Clinton as radical, \nracist and corrupt. The Breitbart contributor Peter Schweizer followed \u201cClinton \nCash,\u201d a book that helped spread the Uranium One conspiracy, with \u201cSecret \nEmpires,\u201d which targeted Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. Mr. \nSchweizer\u2019s most recent book, \u201cProfiles in Corruption,\u201d provides building blocks\n for scandals involving a number of 2020 Democratic hopefuls, like the daft \ntidbit that Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s son-in-law produced a film with support \nfrom two Iranian organizations. The investors, Mr. Schweizer wrote, \u201cmight \nappear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations \u2014 but they are \nnot. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government.\u201d It may \nnot seem like much, but as the birtherism conspiracy shows, scandals have been \nrooted in less. These ginned-up scandals have real implications for Donald \nTrump\u2019s impeachment. Evidence abounds that the president and his team not only \nattempted to solicit Russian interference in the 2016 election but sought to \ncoerce Ukraine into interfering in 2020. But if every politician is indelibly \ncorrupt, then Mr. Trump deserves no real punishment. To write off Mr. Trump\u2019s \nwrongdoing as run-of-the-mill politics, then, requires both minimizing what he \nhas done and scandalizing what other politicians do. As an added bonus, the \nstrategy damages Americans\u2019 faith in government and public service, bolstering \nthe Republican Party\u2019s anti-government agenda. As such, it\u2019s a powerful, \neffective political strategy \u2014 and a deeply nihilistic one.

            "full_text": " There\u2019s a Strong Case for Sticking With Bail Reform \nThe New York law has been on the books for less than a month and already the \ncritics are on the attack. By Emily Bazelon and Insha Rahman Ms. Bazelon is a \nstaff writer for The New York Times Magazine. Ms. Rahman is the director of \nstrategy and new initiatives at the Vera Institute of Justice. Since bail reform\n began in New York on Jan. 1, opponents have been hard at work to create a \nbacklash against the new law, sometimes wrongly blaming it for the commission of\n crimes by people they say should have been jailed for earlier offenses, and \nwarning of broad danger to the public. Using this old script, prosecutors and \npolice chiefs are demanding rollbacks as a public opinion survey shows that \nsupport for bail reform is falling. Largely untold are the stories of thousands \nof New Yorkers who have been released without incident, and allowed to return to\n their families, jobs and communities while charges against them are pending. \nThe law is unusual, compared with those in some other states, and that\u2019s one \nreason it\u2019s politically vulnerable. But it has the potential to end mass \nincarceration as we know it in New York, with an anticipated drop in the jail \npopulation statewide of 40 percent. It deserves a chance to prove itself. Before\n the new law, 21,000 New Yorkers were in jail on any given night around the \nstate. More than 60 percent were being held before trial, primarily because they\n couldn\u2019t afford to pay bail. The new law has already reduced the number to \n15,000 by making release before trial automatic for people accused of most \nmisdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, which make up 90 percent of the roughly \n400,000 arrests each year. Judges still have the authority in all cases to \nimpose conditions like oversight by a case manager, referrals to treatment or \ncounseling, and in some cases, electronic monitoring. For example, take the case\n of Tiffany Harris, who was arrested and charged with slapping three Orthodox \nJewish women on the street in Brooklyn, released without bail, and then \nrearrested for hitting someone else. A judge could have ordered mental health \ncounseling after the first incident that might have helped her instead of just \nletting her go. Judges can also still set bail on almost all violent felony \noffenses, any case involving sexual abuse or misconduct, all felony and some \nmisdemeanor domestic violence offenses, and witness intimidation and tampering \ncases. The most common charges for which release must now be allowed are drug \npossession, theft and unlicensed driving. The best evidence for the success of \nbail reform comes from Brooklyn. Prosecutors there stopped demanding bail for \nalmost all misdemeanors in April 2017. Over the next year, the number of people \nheld on bail in Brooklyn declined by 43 percent, and Brooklyn has also \nexperienced a decline in crime, with fewer shootings and the lowest number of \nmurders in the borough\u2019s history in 2019, according to the district attorney\u2019s \noffice. In 2019, the Bronx and Manhattan followed Brooklyn\u2019s lead with similar \nresults. The real impact of bail reform is being felt in upstate New York, where\n 60 percent of the people in jail are charged with misdemeanors. Already, there \nhave been major drops in the number of people in jail in counties like Herkimer \nand Onondaga, with no upticks in crime. Despite those facts, bail reform is in \npolitical trouble mainly because the state is the only one in the country that \nbars a judge who is deciding if bail is warranted from considering whether a \nperson poses a threat to public safety. For decades, New York judges have been \nallowed to consider only the likelihood that the defendant will appear for \nfuture court dates (though it is likely that at least some judges factor in \npublic safety in their calculus). When bail reform was debated last year, the \nNew York State Legislature considered adding a public-safety provision for a \nsmall subset of serious cases. But many proponents of reform, especially defense\n lawyers, feared such a provision would give judges too much leeway to impose \npreventive detention. The Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo instead struck a \ncompromise that left money bail as an option for almost all violent crimes, the \nsame small subset of serious cases for which a public-safety provision was \nconsidered and rejected. Now the governor is mostly defending bail reform, but \nhe also called it an \u201congoing process\u201d in his budget address Tuesday. If New \nYork decides to tweak its law, it should do so based on months, not weeks, of \ndata. Any amendments should safeguard the principle that the state cannot have \ntwo systems of justice, one for the rich and one for the poor. If the \nLegislature decides to allow judges to detain people for the sake of public \nsafety, it should also eliminate money bail entirely, so that wealthy people \naren\u2019t released while others facing the same charges are jailed. And a public-\nsafety provision should apply only to serious offenses, and require a hearing \nwith facts showing that the person is likely to threaten someone else\u2019s physical\n safety. The results of bail reform in New Jersey show the benefits of staying \nthe course. In 2017, New Jersey courts essentially stopped imposing cash bail \nfor all criminal charges. Early on, opponents said things like, \u201cNobody\u2019s afraid\n to commit crimes anymore,\u201d and one mother sued the state after her son was \nkilled, allegedly by a man who had been released on a gun possession charge. The\n New Jersey Supreme Court made it easier to detain people accused of gun crimes \nor repeat offenses, but otherwise, the state weathered the criticism. In 2017, \naccording to state data, less than 3 percent of people released before trial \nwere rearrested for a serious violent felony or for gun possession. On any given\n day in 2018, 6,000 fewer people were in jail than had been six years earlier. \nAt the same time, violent crime in New Jersey continued to fall. The experience \nof other states also shows the value of another element of New York\u2019s new law: \nreducing the time that prosecutors have to turn over evidence in their \npossession to the defense. New York\u2019s so-called blindfold law had allowed \nprosecutors to withhold key evidence until the morning of trial, and had \ncontributed to wrongful convictions, according to the state bar association. \nNorth Carolina and Texas enacted laws in the last decade requiring broad \ndisclosure of evidence, known as discovery. At first, prosecutors said the \nrequirements were unworkable and put witnesses and victims at risk by \npotentially disclosing their identities. But judges in those states \u2014 and in New\n York \u2014 can limit disclosure when necessary. Over time, the laws in North \nCarolina and Texas proved their worth. A 2016 study of North Carolina\u2019s law \nfound that 91 percent of prosecutors reported the law was working well. Texas \nprosecutors have urged New York to view their state as a model for discovery \npractices. Studies show that it takes only two or three days behind bars to \nincrease the risk that someone charged with a minor, nonviolent crime will be \narrested again. It may seem counterintuitive, but jailing people leads to less, \nnot more, public safety. Jail destabilizes people who may already be struggling \nto pay the rent or get to work. Fear-mongering makes for spicy headlines but \nterrible policy. New Yorkers should not give in to it.

            "full_text": " Bernie Will Have to Fight Dirty Despite his \nreputation for gruffness, Sanders hesitates to attack his opponents directly. He\n shouldn\u2019t hold back. By Elizabeth Bruenig Ms. Bruenig is an Opinion writer. \nWhen the former Vermont governor Peter Shumlin took to Politico to air his \nconcern that Senator Bernie Sanders will \u201cplay dirty\u201d as the race for the 2020 \nDemocratic nomination advances, I thought: If only. Despite mounting mainstream \nDemocratic panic about the prospect of a scorched-earth Sanders campaign, Mr. \nSanders\u2019s recent struggles indicate that his greatest handicap may be his \nunwillingness to wage total war. On Monday, a digital newsletter issued by Mr. \nSanders\u2019s speechwriter and adviser David Sirota directed recipients to an essay \nby Zephyr Teachout, which warned readers that \u201cBiden has a big corruption \nproblem and it makes him a weak candidate.\u201d Ms. Teachout, a Fordham law \nprofessor and expert on corruption and transparency, has stumped for Mr. Sanders\n throughout his campaign. Ms. Teachout\u2019s essay is sober and specific, tracing \nMr. Biden\u2019s history of legislative activity that happened to favor the interests\n of his major donors. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign was infuriated by the op-ed. But \ninstead of backing Ms. Teachout \u2014 or simply keeping his head down and forging \nahead with ground efforts in Iowa \u2014 Mr. Sanders made a point of apologizing to \nMr. Biden and denouncing the essay. \u201cIt is absolutely not my view that Joe is \ncorrupt in any way. And I\u2019m sorry that that op-ed appeared,\u201d Mr. Sanders said on\n CBS News on Monday. What Mr. Sanders could have said \u2014 should have said \u2014 is \nthat Ms. Teachout\u2019s piece was remarkably restrained and that much more worrying \nevidence could be adduced to call Mr. Biden\u2019s ethics into question. Putting \naside his warm relations with donors in the credit card industry, Mr. Biden\u2019s \nrecord is mottled with more episodes of apparent corruption than Ms. Teachout \nlisted in her op-ed. In a 2008 episode of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Tom Brokaw \ninterrogated Mr. Biden about the fact that his son, Hunter Biden, was employed \nby MBNA, a bank holding firm \u2014 which also happened to be a major donor to the \nelder Biden, and a strong advocate for the bankruptcy bill he worked to pass \nwhile his son cashed MBNA checks. It is hard to imagine how the younger Biden \nwould have become \u201cthe very model of a modern major lobbyist,\u201d as Politico put \nit in a 2007 article, \u201cwith an office near K Street, a blue-ribbon roster of \nclients,\u201d and a firm grossing $1.76 million in lobbying revenue in the first \nhalf of 2006 alone were it not for his parentage. A transcript of the hearing on\n Hunter Biden\u2019s nomination to Amtrak\u2019s board of directors shows that while the \nother nominee joining him that day, Donna McLean, had a 15-year career in \nfederal service with a focus on transportation policy, Hunter\u2019s specific \nqualification for the position was that he often rode trains. Hunter was \nintroduced by Senator Tom Carper of Delaware that day not principally as a \nlogical choice for Amtrak\u2019s board, but as the son of Joe Biden. The fact that \nthe Bidens are entangled in Trump\u2019s impeachment odyssey \u2014 uncomfortably, and \nwith no clear exit strategy aside from keeping mum \u2014 should also raise serious \nquestions about Mr. Biden\u2019s fortitude in the general election. But all this, Mr.\n Sanders declined to say \u2014 not because it isn\u2019t relevant and not because it \ndoesn\u2019t fit with Mr. Sanders\u2019s platform \u2014 but because Mr. Sanders, for all his \nfamed gruffness, doesn\u2019t like going negative. \u201cI\u2019ve never run a negative ad in \nmy life,\u201d Mr. Sanders told reporters upon announcing his 2016 primary bid, \u201cI \nhate and detest these ugly, 30-second negative ads.\u201d True to form, the single \nattack ad Mr. Sanders ran during his race against Hillary Clinton contained \nneither her name nor her visage, only a reference to Goldman Sachs\u2019s financial \nhold on Washington. Contrast that with the sort of material then-Senator Barack \nObama aired against Mrs. Clinton in 2008 \u2014 claiming, for instance, that she \nwould say anything to get elected, that she didn\u2019t tell the truth, that she was \na \u201ccorporate lawyer sitting on the board of Walmart \u201d \u2014 and Mr. Sanders\u2019s forays\n into offense in 2020 appear quite mild. That is because they are. But Mr. \nSanders can\u2019t afford mildness, or a steady habit of capitulation. The critical \ndistinction between Bernie Sanders and the donor-driven, suborned, anti-\ndemocratic politics he hopes to overthrow is his greatest virtue, and his \nstrongest appeal. But for that distinction to be more than an abstraction, Mr. \nSanders will have to illuminate the contrast between the way he practices \npolitics and the way his opponents do. This will mean running attack ads, \ndevoting stump time to his opponents\u2019 unsavory histories and standing behind \nsurrogates who do the same. The financial capture of Washington that he \nrightfully detests is real, and it is manifest in his opponents. He will have to\n own that, or risk campaigning hobbled. There isn\u2019t any way around it; the logic\n that demands it is inscribed into every speech Mr. Sanders makes. Perhaps \nbecause his vision is grander than the venality and misbehavior of individual \npoliticians, or perhaps because he is a private person and respects the privacy \nof others, Mr. Sanders seems reluctant to mount attacks that could be construed \nas personal. Both possibilities reflect what is most lovely in Mr. Sanders: That\n he is visionary and that he is principled. But in this world, systematic forces\n operate through human hands, and so Mr. Sanders must fight real, flesh-and-\nblood opponents, too. It will take that much and more to win.

            "full_text": "Opinion Why Democrats Still Have to Appeal to the Center, but Republicans Don\u2019t \nPolarization has changed the two parties \u2014 just not in the same way. \nCredit...Nicolas Ortega Supported by By Ezra Klein Mr. Klein is the author of \n\u201cWhy We\u2019re Polarized.\u201d American politics has been dominated by the Democratic \nand Republican Parties since the Civil War. That gives us the illusion of \nstability \u2014 that today\u2019s political divisions cut roughly the same lines as \nyesteryear. But in recent decades, the two parties have been changing, and fast.\n Those changes are ideological \u2014 the Democratic Party has moved left, and the \nRepublican Party has moved right. But more fundamentally, those changes are \ncompositional: Democrats have become more diverse, urban, young and secular, and\n the Republican Party has turned itself into a vehicle for whiter, older, more \nChristian and more rural voters. This is the root cause of intensifying \npolarization: Our differences, both ideological and demographic, map onto our \nparty divisions today in ways they didn\u2019t in the past. But the changes have not \naffected the parties symmetrically. Put simply, Democrats can\u2019t win running the \nkinds of campaigns and deploying the kinds of tactics that succeed for \nRepublicans. They can move to the left \u2014 and they are \u2014 but they can\u2019t abandon \nthe center or, given the geography of American politics, the center-right, and \nstill hold power. Democrats are modestly, but importantly, restrained by \ndiversity and democracy. Republicans are not. Let\u2019s start with diversity. Over \nthe past 50 years, the Democratic and Republican coalitions have sorted by \nideology, race, religion, geography and psychology. Not all sorting is the same.\n Sorting has made Democrats more diverse and Republicans more homogeneous. This \nis often played as a political weakness for Democrats. They\u2019re a collection of \ninterest groups, a party of list makers, an endless roll call. But diversity has\n played a crucial role in moderating the party\u2019s response to polarization. \nAppealing to Democrats requires appealing to a lot of different kinds of people \nwith different interests. Republicans are overwhelmingly dependent on white \nvoters. Democrats are a coalition of liberal whites, African-Americans, \nHispanics, Asians and mixed-race voters. Republicans are overwhelmingly \ndependent on Christian voters. Democrats are a coalition of liberal and nonwhite\n Christians, Jews, Muslims, New Agers, agnostics, Buddhists and so on. Three-\nquarters of Republicans identify as conservative, while only half of Democrats \ncall themselves liberals \u2014 and for Democrats, that\u2019s a historically high level. \nAs a result, winning the Democratic primary means winning liberal whites in New \nHampshire and traditionalist blacks in South Carolina. It means talking to Irish\n Catholics in Boston and atheists in San Francisco. It means inspiring liberals \nwithout arousing the fears of moderates. It\u2019s important preparation for the \ndifficult, pluralistic work of governing, in which the needs and concerns of \nmany different groups must be balanced against one another. The Democratic Party\n is not just more diverse in who it represents; it\u2019s also more diverse in whom \nit listens to. A new Pew survey tested Democratic and Republican trust in 30 \ndifferent media sources, ranging from left to right. Democrats trusted 22 of the\n 30 sources, including center-right outlets like The Wall Street Journal. \nRepublicans trusted only seven of the 30 sources, with PBS, the BBC and The Wall\n Street Journal the only mainstream outlets with significant trust. (The other \ntrusted sources, in case you were wondering, were Fox News, Sean Hannity, Rush \nLimbaugh and Breitbart.) Fox News, in particular, holds a unique centrality in \nRepublican media: Sixty-five percent of Republicans say they trust it, more than\n twice as many as trust any other outlet, and 60 percent of Republicans said \nthey relied on Fox News in the previous week \u2014 again, more than twice the \nproportion who relied on any other news brand. Among Democrats, by contrast, the\n most-trusted and frequently consulted outlet was CNN. The Democratic Party\u2019s \ninformational ecosystem combines mainstream sources that seek objectivity, \nliberal sources that push partiality and even some center-right sources with \nexcellent reputations. On any given question, liberals trust in sources that \npull them left and sources that pull them toward the center, in sources oriented\n toward escalation and sources oriented toward moderation, in sources that root \ntheir identity in a political movement and in sources that carefully tend a \nreputation for being antagonistic toward political movements. There is no \nsimilar diversity in the Republican Party\u2019s trusted informational ecosystem, \nwhich is heavily built around self-consciously conservative news sources. There \nshould be a check on this sort of epistemic closure. A party that narrows the \nsources it listens to is also narrowing the voters it can speak to. And \npolitical parties ultimately want to win elections. Lose enough of them, enough \ntimes, and even the most stubborn ideologues will accept reform. Democracy, in \nother words, should discipline parties that close their informational \necosystems. But America isn\u2019t a democracy. Republicans control the White House, \nthe Senate, the Supreme Court and a majority of governorships. Only the House is\n under Democratic control. And yet Democrats haven\u2019t just won more votes in the \nHouse elections. They won more votes over the last three Senate elections, too. \nThey won more votes in both the 2016 and 2000 presidential elections. But \nAmerica\u2019s political system counts states and districts rather than people, and \nthe G.O.P.\u2019s more rural coalition has a geographic advantage that offsets its \npopular disadvantage. To win power, Democrats don\u2019t just need to appeal to the \nvoter in the middle. They need to appeal to voters to the right of the middle. \nWhen Democrats compete for the Senate, they are forced to appeal to an \nelectorate that is far more conservative than the country as a whole. Similarly,\n gerrymandering and geography means that Democrats need to win a substantial \nmajority in the House popular vote to take the gavel. And a recent study by \nMichael Geruso, Dean Spears and Ishaana Talesara calculates that the Republican \nParty\u2019s Electoral College advantage means \u201cRepublicans should be expected to win\n 65 percent of presidential contests in which they narrowly lose the popular \nvote.\u201d The Republican Party, by contrast, can run campaigns aimed at a voter \nwell to the right of the median American. Republicans have lost the popular vote\n in six of the last seven presidential elections. If they\u2019d also lost six of the\n last seven presidential elections, they most likely would have overhauled their\n message and agenda. If Trump had lost in 2016, he \u2014 and the political style he \nrepresents \u2014 would have been discredited for blowing a winnable election. The \nRepublican moderates who\u2019d counseled more outreach to black and Hispanic voters \nwould have been strengthened. Instead, Republicans are trapped in a dangerous \nplace: They represent a shrinking constituency that holds vast political power. \nThat has injected an almost manic urgency into their strategy. Behind the \nparty\u2019s tactical extremism lurks an apocalyptic sense of political stakes. This \nwas popularized in the infamous \u201cFlight 93 Election\u201d essay arguing that \nconservatives needed to embrace Trump, because if he failed, \u201cdeath is certain.\u201d\n You could hear its echoes in Attorney General William P. Barr\u2019s recent speech, \nin which he argued that \u201cthe force, fervor and comprehensiveness of the assault \non religion\u201d poses a threat unlike any America has faced in the past. \u201cThis is \nnot decay,\u201d he warned, \u201cit is organized destruction.\u201d This is why one of the few\n real hopes for depolarizing American politics is democratization. If \nRepublicans couldn\u2019t fall back on the distortions of the Electoral College, the \ngeography of the United States Senate and the gerrymandering of House seats \u2014 if\n they had, in other words, to win over a majority of Americans \u2014 they would \nbecome a more moderate and diverse party. This is not a hypothetical: The \ncountry\u2019s most popular governors are Charlie Baker in Massachusetts and Larry \nHogan in Maryland. Both are Republicans governing, with majority support, in \nblue states. A democratization agenda isn\u2019t hard to imagine. We could do away \nwith the Electoral College and gerrymandering; pass proportional representation \nand campaign finance reform; make voter registration automatic and give \nWashington, D.C., and Puerto Rico the political representation they deserve. But\n precisely because the Republican Party sees deepening democracy as a threat to \nits future, it will use the power it holds to block any moves in that direction.\n The alternative to democratizing America is scarier than mere polarization: It \nis, eventually, a legitimacy crisis that could threaten the very foundation of \nour political system. By 2040, 70 percent of Americans will live in the 15 \nlargest states. That means 70 percent of America will be represented by only 30 \nsenators, while the other 30 percent of America will be represented by 70 \nsenators. It is not difficult to envision an America where Republicans \nconsistently win the presidency despite rarely winning the popular vote, where \nthey typically control both the House and the Senate despite rarely winning more\n votes than the Democrats, where their dominance of the Supreme Court is \nunquestioned and where all this power is used to buttress a system of partisan \ngerrymandering, pro-corporate campaign finance laws, strict voter identification\n requirements and anti-union legislation that further weakens Democrats\u2019 \nelectoral performance. Down that road lies true political crisis. In the \nmeantime, though, it\u2019s important to recognize the truth about our system: Both \nparties have polarized, but in very different ways, and with very different \nconsequences for American politics.

And when he finally did come out of it, Gibson still \nwasn\u2019t quite sure what to do with the manuscript he\u2019d been working on, about a \nyoung woman in modern-day San Francisco, since the world he\u2019d situated her in \nseemed to have suddenly disappeared. \u201cIf I had somehow been able to finish it, \nby the time it was published, it would have just been this lost thing,\u201d he said,\n \u201ccompletely out of time and unconcerned with what I immediately saw as being \nthe beginning of something extraordinary, and almost certainly something \nextraordinarily bad.\u201d In the end, he turned the new book into a sequel to his \n2014 novel, \u201cThe Peripheral.\u201d Part of \u201cThe Peripheral\u201d is set in a 22nd century \nwhere the world as we know it has been wiped out by a confluence of events known\n as \u201cThe Jackpot,\u201d which is, as Gibson put it to me, \u201call the bad stuff that \nwe\u2019re worried about now coming true.\u201d Eighty percent of the population has died,\n and many of the survivors live under the authority of a hereditary oligarchy \ndescended from Russian kleptocrats. People in that future have developed the \nability to use data to reach back in time, but when they do, rather than \nchanging the course of events, they inaugurate new, parallel continuums, called \n\u201cstubs.\u201d Much of the new book, \u201cAgency,\u201d takes place in a stub where Hillary \nClinton won the election and Brexit never happened. Characters from the future \u2014\n from Gibson\u2019s extrapolated version of our own dark timeline \u2014 try to help \npeople in the alternate past avoid a similarly cataclysmic fate. The question \nlooming over the book is not whether the future will be horrifying but whether \nthere\u2019s even the possibility of a future that isn\u2019t. Gibson is famed for his \nsensitivity to the zeitgeist, and I asked him if he thought that part of what \nhe\u2019d picked up on here is a growing sense of the future as an abyss. \u201cIn my \nchildhood, the 21st century was constantly referenced,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d see it \nonce every day, and it often had an exclamation point.\u201d The sense, he said, was \nthat postwar America was headed somewhere amazing. Now that we\u2019re actually in \nthe 21st century, however, the 22nd century is never evoked with excitement. \u201cWe\n don\u2019t seem to have, culturally, a sense of futurism that way anymore,\u201d he said.\n \u201cIt sort of evaporated.\u201d The dearth of optimistic visions of the future, at \nleast in the United States, is central to the psychic atmosphere of this bleak \nera. Pessimism is everywhere: in opinion polls, in rising suicide rates and \nfalling birthrates, and in the downwardly mobile trajectory of millennials. It\u2019s\n political and it\u2019s cultural: At some point in the last few years, a feeling has\n set in that the future is being foreclosed. When, in the 1970s, the Sex Pistols\n sang \u201cThere is no future,\u201d there was at least a confrontational relish to it. \nNow there\u2019s just dread. The right and the left share a sense of creeping doom, \nthough for different reasons. For people on the right, it\u2019s sparked by horror at\n changing demographics and gender roles. For those on the left, a primary source\n of foreboding is climate change, which makes speculation about what the world \nwill look like decades hence so terrifying that it\u2019s often easier not to think \nabout it at all. But it\u2019s not just climate change. In his forthcoming book, \u201cThe\n Decadent Society,\u201d my colleague Ross Douthat mourns the death of the \n\u201ctechnological sublime,\u201d writing that our era \u201cfor all its digital wonders has \nlost the experience of awe-inspiring technological progress that prior modern \ngenerations came to take for granted.\u201d This is true, but doesn\u2019t go nearly far \nenough. Our problem is not just that new technologies regularly fail to thrill. \nIt\u2019s that, from artificial intelligence to genetic engineering to mass \nsurveillance, they are frequently sources of horror. Consider some recent \nheadlines. The New York Times reported on Clearview AI, a start-up whose facial-\nmatching technology could give strangers access to the identity and biographical\n information of anyone seen in public. (\u201cSure, that might lead to a dystopian \nfuture or something, but you can\u2019t ban it,\u201d one investor said.) Reuters \ndescribed classes in South Korea that teach people how to arrange their features\n for job interviews performed by computers that use \u201cfacial recognition \ntechnology to analyze character.\u201d Wired had a story about \u201csmart contact lenses\u201d\n that could overlay digital interfaces on everything you see, which is not so \ndifferent from the visual feeds that the post-Jackpot characters have in \u201cThe \nPeripheral\u201d and \u201cAgency.\u201d Around the world, the social media technologies that \nwere supposed to expand democracy and human connection have instead fueled \nauthoritarianism and ethnic cleansing. Andrew Yang is running a remarkably \nsuccessful insurgent presidential campaign premised on the threat that \nautomation and robots pose to the social order. Fear of the future doesn\u2019t pose \nmuch of a political problem for conservatism. Reactionary politics feed on \ncultural despair; the right is usually happy to look backward. In his 1955 \nmission statement for National Review, William F. Buckley Jr. famously wrote \nthat the magazine \u201cstands athwart history, yelling Stop.\u201d It\u2019s a bigger problem \nfor the left, which by definition needs to believe in progress. In 2013, Alyssa \nBattistoni wrote in the socialist magazine Jacobin about the challenge that \nclimate change poses to left politics, asking, \u201cWhat should the orientation be \nof a politics that\u2019s playing the long game when the arc of the universe is \nstarting to feel frighteningly short?\u201d I suspect that one reason Pete Buttigieg,\n the 38-year-old former mayor of a Midwestern city, has vaulted into the top \ntier of presidential candidates is that he speaks so confidently about the \nfuture. He asks voters to picture the day after the last day of Trump\u2019s \npresidency and discusses how the world might be when he\u2019s nearly as old as his \nseptuagenarian competitors. \u201cYou just have a certain mind-set based on the fact \nthat \u2014 to put it a little bluntly \u2014 you plan to be here in 2050,\u201d he once said. \nBut his forward-looking technocratic pitch has mostly failed to resonate with \nhis own generation. Instead, it appears that the people most soothed by \nButtigieg\u2019s ideas about what America might look like decades hence are those who\n won\u2019t be here to experience it. The candidate who polls show has the most \nsupport among young people is Bernie Sanders, the oldest person in the race. \nClearly, Sanders fills his followers with hope and makes them feel that a \ntransformed world is possible, but he also speaks to their terrors. Recently \nSanders backers released one of the more moving campaign videos of this cycle. \nSet to a mournful cover of \u201cThe Times They Are A-Changin\u2019,\u201d it features \ninspirational scenes of the senator and his supporters, but also flooded \nstreets, wildfires and an emaciated polar bear; in one scene protesters hang a \nbanner that says, \u201cWe deserve a future.\u201d It\u2019s an ad that speaks to the desperate\n longing for kindness and solidarity to replace the cruelties of a society \ndevouring itself, but also a grief-stricken apprehension of what\u2019s in store if \nthey don\u2019t. Writing about the future is usually just a way of writing about the \npresent, and were it not for climate change, one might see widespread anxiety \nabout what\u2019s coming as just an expression of despair about what\u2019s here. It\u2019s \nstill possible, of course, that someday people will look back on the dawn of the\n 2020s as a menacing moment after which the world\u2019s potential opened up once \nagain. But that would seem to require political and scientific leaps that are \nhard to envision right now, much less stake one\u2019s faith in. Though Gibson\u2019s \nolder work is frequently described as dystopian, he used to consider himself an \noptimist. \u201cNeuromancer,\u201d he pointed out, was written in the early 1980s and \nposited a future in which the Cold War hadn\u2019t led to apocalypse, something far \nfrom guaranteed at the time. \u201cSince the end of the Cold War, I\u2019ve prided myself \non being the guy who says, eh, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not going to happen tomorrow,\u201d \nhe said. \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve lost that.\u201d This darkness where the future should be, he \nsaid, \u201cmakes my creative life much, much more difficult,\u201d since he doesn\u2019t \nsimply want to surrender to gloom. Gibson is a man renowned for his prophetic \ncreativity, but he can\u2019t imagine his way out of our civilizational predicament. \nNo wonder so many others are struggling to do so. ",

            "full_text": " Joe Biden Is Stronger Than You Think Here\u2019s why he is\n still winning. By David Brooks Opinion Columnist It was yet another epic \nfailure of political punditry. Go back to the early months of Joe Biden\u2019s \npresidential campaign and read what the consultants and commentators were saying\n about him: His support is just name recognition; he\u2019ll fade! He\u2019s too old! He\u2019s\n running a zombie campaign! The party has moved left and he\u2019s out of touch! He \nvoted for the crime bill! Almost everybody was bearish on Joe. But now look \nwhere we are, weeks from actual voting. If the polls are to be believed, Biden \nwill win Iowa, he\u2019ll come in second in New Hampshire, he will easily win Nevada,\n he will dominate in South Carolina. He\u2019s now tied for the lead in California \nand he\u2019s way ahead in Texas. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll win the nomination (both he \nand Bernie Sanders look strong), but this is not where a lot of people six \nmonths ago thought we\u2019d be. It\u2019s the 947th consecutive sign that we in the \ncoastal chattering classes have not cured our insularity problem. It\u2019s the 947th\n case in which we see that every second you spend on Twitter detracts from your \nknowledge of American politics, and that the only cure to this insularity \ndisease is constant travel and interviewing, close attention to state and local \ndata and raw abject humility about the fact that the attitudes and academic \ndegrees that you think make you clever are actually the attitudes and academic \ndegrees that separate you from the real texture of American life. Biden didn\u2019t \njust luck into this. He and his team grasped six truths: Understand the year you\n are running in. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are running the same basic \ncampaign they would have run in 2012 or 2016. Biden\u2019s campaign is completely \nfocused on the central problem of 2020: that Donald Trump is a steaming hot mess\n in the middle of national life. Biden has fixated his campaign on the Trump \nproblem and fighting for the soul of America. Nearly twice as many Democrats say\n it\u2019s more important to beat Trump than to have a candidate with whom they agree\n on all issues. Understand your party\u2019s core challenge. All around the world \nparties on the left are losing because they have lost touch with the working \nclass. These parties think they can reconnect with that class by swinging even \nfurther left. But Jeremy Corbyn in Britain and Bernie Sanders here are a \ndoctoral student\u2019s idea of a working-class candidate, not an actual working \nperson\u2019s idea of one. Biden has criticized his own party for losing touch with \nthis class. He emerged from it, is focusing his attention on it and is winning \nsupport from it. Moderates are still powerful. The Democratic Party is moving \nleft, but about half of Democrats still say they are moderate or conservative. \nNo candidate has ever won a nomination without strong support from these voters,\n while college-town candidates \u2014 Howard Dean, Gary Hart \u2014 tend to falter. In \nevery presidential general election that Democrats have won since 1988, they \ncarried moderates by more than 12 percentage points. In every race they have \nlost, they failed to do that. Biden kept his moderate credentials when many \nother candidates saw A.O.C. on Twitter and decided to move left. Many Democrats \nresent their own elites. There is a quiet tension between Democrats who wield \ncultural power and those who don\u2019t. The former are active on social media, and \nclobber the latter \u2014 people who say or write the \u201cwrong\u201d thing.  The non-elites \ntend to feel judged and looked down on by the self-appointed savior class. \n\u201cPolitically correct\u201d has become the phrase people use to define those who use \ncultural power to enforce ideological conformity. Seventy percent of Democrats \nwho are not on social media say political correctness is a big problem. These \nare people silently but vehemently reacting against this social reign of terror.\n Biden communicates affection, not judgment, acceptance, not expulsion. Have a \nbetter theory of social change. Sanders and Warren imagine they can rally \nmovements of progressive supermajorities to transform American politics. The \nreality is that if they are elected we\u2019ll be stuck with the same 42 percent-\nto-42 percent stagnant political war we have now. Biden starts with the \nunderstanding that we are a closely divided nation. He understands the elemental\n fact that if you want to pass laws you have to go through Congress. As Damon \nLinker pointed out recently in The Week, Biden\u2019s argument is that a center-left \ncongressional coalition is the best we can do under present circumstances. \nThat\u2019s a more realistic theory of change. A beloved legislator like Biden is \nmore likely to transform the political landscape than a down-the-line \nprogressive. Connection. Connection. Connection. Many candidates pound the \npodium and lecture at their rallies. It\u2019s the big leader onstage and the \npassionate mass of followers down below. Nobody makes an individual connection \nas well as Biden. In a time when people feel exhausted, isolated and alienated, \na candidate who seems normal and emotionally relatable is going to have a lot of\n appeal. The ironic fact is that the candidate who can be vulnerable has a \nsurprising power. ",

In Wonderland, \nwe celebrated the new digital services as free, but now we see that the \nsurveillance capitalists behind those services regard us as the free commodity. \nWe thought that we search Google, but now we understand that Google searches us.\n We assumed that we use social media to connect, but we learned that connection \nis how social media uses us. We barely questioned why our new TV or mattress had\n a privacy policy, but we\u2019ve begun to understand that \u201cprivacy\u201d policies are \nactually surveillance policies. And like our forebears who named the automobile \n\u201chorseless carriage\u201d because they could not reckon with its true dimension, we \nregarded the internet platforms as \u201cbulletin boards\u201d where anyone could pin a \nnote. Congress cemented this delusion in a statute, Section 230 of the 1996 \nCommunications Decency Act, absolving those companies of the obligations that \nadhere to \u201cpublishers\u201d or even to \u201cspeakers.\u201d Only repeated crises have taught \nus that these platforms are not bulletin boards but hyper-velocity global \nbloodstreams into which anyone may introduce a dangerous virus without a \nvaccine. This is how Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, could legally \nrefuse to remove a faked video of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and later \ndouble down on this decision, announcing that political advertising would not be\n subject to fact-checking. All of these delusions rest on the most treacherous \nhallucination of them all: the belief that privacy is private. We have imagined \nthat we can choose our degree of privacy with an individual calculation in which\n a bit of personal information is traded for valued services \u2014 a reasonable quid\n pro quo. For example, when Delta Air Lines piloted a biometric data system at \nthe Atlanta airport, the company reported that of nearly 25,000 customers who \ntraveled there each week, 98 percent opted into the process, noting that \u201cthe \nfacial recognition option is saving an average of two seconds for each customer \nat boarding, or nine minutes when boarding a wide body aircraft.\u201d In fact the \nrapid development of facial recognition systems reveals the public consequences \nof this supposedly private choice. Surveillance capitalists have demanded the \nright to take our faces wherever they appear \u2014 on a city street or a Facebook \npage. The Financial Times reported that a Microsoft facial recognition training \ndatabase of 10 million images plucked from the internet without anyone\u2019s \nknowledge and supposedly limited to academic research was employed by companies \nlike IBM and state agencies that included the United States and Chinese \nmilitary. Among these were two Chinese suppliers of equipment to officials in \nXinjiang, where members of the Uighur community live in open-air prisons under \nperpetual surveillance by facial recognition systems. Privacy is not private, \nbecause the effectiveness of these and other private or public surveillance and \ncontrol systems depends upon the pieces of ourselves that we give up \u2014 or that \nare secretly stolen from us. Our digital century was to have been democracy\u2019s \nGolden Age. Instead, we enter its third decade marked by a stark new form of \nsocial inequality best understood as \u201cepistemic inequality.\u201d It recalls a pre-\nGutenberg era of extreme asymmetries of knowledge and the power that accrues to \nsuch knowledge, as the tech giants seize control of information and learning \nitself. The delusion of \u201cprivacy as private\u201d was crafted to breed and feed this \nunanticipated social divide. Surveillance capitalists exploit the widening \ninequity of knowledge for the sake of profits. They manipulate the economy, our \nsociety and even our lives with impunity, endangering not just individual \nprivacy but democracy itself. Distracted by our delusions, we failed to notice \nthis bloodless coup from above. The belief that privacy is private has left us \ncareening toward a future that we did not choose, because it failed to reckon \nwith the profound distinction between a society that insists upon sovereign \nindividual rights and one that lives by the social relations of the one-way \nmirror. The lesson is that privacy is public \u2014 it is a collective good that is \nlogically and morally inseparable from the values of human autonomy and self-\ndetermination upon which privacy depends and without which a democratic society \nis unimaginable. Still, the winds appear to have finally shifted. A fragile new \nawareness is dawning as we claw our way back up the rabbit hole toward home. \nSurveillance capitalists are fast because they seek neither genuine consent nor \nconsensus. They rely on psychic numbing and messages of inevitability to conjure\n the helplessness, resignation and confusion that paralyze their prey. Democracy\n is slow, and that\u2019s a good thing. Its pace reflects the tens of millions of \nconversations that occur in families, among neighbors, co-workers and friends, \nwithin communities, cities and states, gradually stirring the sleeping giant of \ndemocracy to action. These conversations are occurring now, and there are many \nindications that lawmakers are ready to join and to lead. This third decade is \nlikely to decide our fate. Will we make the digital future better, or will it \nmake us worse? Will it be a place that we can call home? Epistemic inequality is\n not based on what we can earn but rather on what we can learn. It is defined as\n unequal access to learning imposed by private commercial mechanisms of \ninformation capture, production, analysis and sales. It is best exemplified in \nthe fast-growing abyss between what we know and what is known about us. \nTwentieth-century industrial society was organized around the \u201cdivision of \nlabor,\u201d and it followed that the struggle for economic equality would shape the \npolitics of that time. Our digital century shifts society\u2019s coordinates from a \ndivision of labor to a \u201cdivision of learning,\u201d and it follows that the struggle \nover access to knowledge and the power conferred by such knowledge will shape \nthe politics of our time. The new centrality of epistemic inequality signals a \npower shift from the ownership of the means of production, which defined the \npolitics of the 20th century, to the ownership of the production of meaning. The\n challenges of epistemic justice and epistemic rights in this new era are \nsummarized in three essential questions about knowledge, authority and power: \nWho knows? Who decides who knows? Who decides who decides who knows? During the \nlast two decades, the leading surveillance capitalists \u2014 Google, later followed \nby Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft \u2014 helped to drive this societal transformation\n while simultaneously ensuring their ascendance to the pinnacle of the epistemic\n hierarchy. They operated in the shadows to amass huge knowledge monopolies by \ntaking without asking, a maneuver that every child recognizes as theft. \nSurveillance capitalism begins by unilaterally staking a claim to private human \nexperience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Our lives \nare rendered as data flows. Early on, it was discovered that, unknown to users, \neven data freely given harbors rich predictive signals, a surplus that is more \nthan what is required for service improvement. It isn\u2019t only what you post \nonline, but whether you use exclamation points or the color saturation of your \nphotos; not just where you walk but the stoop of your shoulders; not just the \nidentity of your face but the emotional states conveyed by your \n\u201cmicroexpressions\u201d; not just what you like but the pattern of likes across \nengagements. Soon this behavioral surplus was secretly hunted and captured, \nclaimed as proprietary data. The data are conveyed through complex supply chains\n of devices, tracking and monitoring software, and ecosystems of apps and \ncompanies that specialize in niche data flows captured in secret. For example, \ntesting by The Wall Street Journal showed that Facebook receives heart rate data\n from the Instant Heart Rate: HR Monitor, menstrual cycle data from the Flo \nPeriod & Ovulation Tracker, and data that reveal interest in real estate \nproperties from Realtor.com \u2014 all of it without the user\u2019s knowledge. These data\n flows empty into surveillance capitalists\u2019 computational factories, called \n\u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d where they are manufactured into behavioral \npredictions that are about us, but they are not for us. Instead, they are sold \nto business customers in a new kind of market that trades exclusively in human \nfutures. Certainty in human affairs is the lifeblood of these markets, where \nsurveillance capitalists compete on the quality of their predictions. This is a \nnew form of trade that birthed some of the richest and most powerful companies \nin history. In order to achieve their objectives, the leading surveillance \ncapitalists sought to establish unrivaled dominance over the 99.9 percent of the\n world\u2019s information now rendered in digital formats that they helped to create.\n Surveillance capital has built most of the world\u2019s largest computer networks, \ndata centers, populations of servers, undersea transmission cables, advanced \nmicrochips, and frontier machine intelligence, igniting an arms race for the \n10,000 or so specialists on the planet who know how to coax knowledge from these\n vast new data continents. With Google in the lead, the top surveillance \ncapitalists seek to control labor markets in critical expertise, including data \nscience and animal research, elbowing out competitors such as start-ups, \nuniversities, high schools, municipalities, established corporations in other \nindustries and less wealthy countries. In 2016, 57 percent of American computer \nscience Ph.D. graduates took jobs in industry, while only 11 percent became \ntenure-track faculty members. It\u2019s not just an American problem. In Britain, \nuniversity administrators contemplate a \u201cmissing generation\u201d of data scientists.\n A Canadian scientist laments, \u201cthe power, the expertise, the data are all \nconcentrated in the hands of a few companies.\u201d Google created the first insanely\n lucrative markets to trade in human futures, what we now know as online \ntargeted advertising, based on their predictions of which ads users would click.\n Between 2000, when the new economic logic was just emerging, and 2004, when the\n company went public, revenues increased by 3,590 percent. This startling number\n represents the \u201csurveillance dividend.\u201d It quickly reset the bar for investors,\n eventually driving start-ups, apps developers and established companies to \nshift their business models toward surveillance capitalism. The promise of a \nfast track to outsized revenues from selling human futures drove this migration \nfirst to Facebook, then through the tech sector and now throughout the rest of \nthe economy to industries as disparate as insurance, retail, finance, education,\n health care, real estate, entertainment and every product that begins with the \nword \u201csmart\u201d or service touted as \u201cpersonalized.\u201d Even Ford, the birthplace of \nthe 20th-century mass production economy, is on the trail of the surveillance \ndividend, proposing to meet the challenge of slumping car sales by reimagining \nFord vehicles as a \u201ctransportation operating system.\u201d As one analyst put it, \nFord \u201ccould make a fortune monetizing data. They won\u2019t need engineers, factories\n or dealers to do it. It\u2019s almost pure profit.\u201d Surveillance capitalism\u2019s \neconomic imperatives were refined in the competition to sell certainty. Early on\n it was clear that machine intelligence must feed on volumes of data, compelling\n economies of scale in data extraction. Eventually it was understood that volume\n is necessary but not sufficient. The best algorithms also require varieties of \ndata \u2014 economies of scope. This realization helped drive the \u201cmobile revolution\u201d\n sending users into the real world armed with cameras, computers, gyroscopes and\n microphones packed inside their smart new phones. In the competition for scope,\n surveillance capitalists want your home and what you say and do within its \nwalls. They want your car, your medical conditions, and the shows you stream; \nyour location as well as all the streets and buildings in your path and all the \nbehavior of all the people in your city. They want your voice and what you eat \nand what you buy; your children\u2019s play time and their schooling; your brain \nwaves and your bloodstream. Nothing is exempt. Unequal knowledge about us \nproduces unequal power over us, and so epistemic inequality widens to include \nthe distance between what we can do and what can be done to us. Data scientists \ndescribe this as the shift from monitoring to actuation, in which a critical \nmass of knowledge about a machine system enables the remote control of that \nsystem. Now people have become targets for remote control, as surveillance \ncapitalists discovered that the most predictive data come from intervening in \nbehavior to tune, herd and modify action in the direction of commercial \nobjectives. This third imperative, \u201ceconomies of action,\u201d has become an arena of\n intense experimentation. \u201cWe are learning how to write the music,\u201d one \nscientist said, \u201cand then we let the music make them dance.\u201d This new power \u201cto \nmake them dance\u201d does not employ soldiers to threaten terror and murder. It \narrives carrying a cappuccino, not a gun. It is a new \u201cinstrumentarian\u201d power \nthat works its will through the medium of ubiquitous digital instrumentation to \nmanipulate subliminal cues, psychologically target communications, impose \ndefault choice architectures, trigger social comparison dynamics and levy \nrewards and punishments \u2014 all of it aimed at remotely tuning, herding and \nmodifying human behavior in the direction of profitable outcomes and always \nengineered to preserve users\u2019 ignorance. We saw predictive knowledge morphing \ninto instrumentarian power in Facebook\u2019s contagion experiments published in 2012\n and 2014, when it planted subliminal cues and manipulated social comparisons on\n its pages, first to influence users to vote in midterm elections and later to \nmake people feel sadder or happier. Facebook researchers celebrated the success \nof these experiments noting two key findings: that it was possible to manipulate\n online cues to influence real world behavior and feelings, and that this could \nbe accomplished while successfully bypassing users\u2019 awareness. In 2016, the \nGoogle-incubated augmented reality game, Pok\u00e9mon Go, tested economies of action \non the streets. Game players did not know that they were pawns in the real game \nof behavior modification for profit, as the rewards and punishments of hunting \nimaginary creatures were used to herd people to the McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks and \nlocal pizza joints that were paying the company for \u201cfootfall,\u201d in exactly the \nsame way that online advertisers pay for \u201cclick through\u201d to their websites. In \n2017, a leaked Facebook document acquired by The Australian exposed the \ncorporation\u2019s interest in applying \u201cpsychological insights\u201d from \u201cinternal \nFacebook data\u201d to modify user behavior. The targets were 6.4 million young \nAustralians and New Zealanders. \u201cBy monitoring posts, pictures, interactions and\n internet activity in real time,\u201d the executives wrote, \u201cFacebook can work out \nwhen young people feel \u2018stressed,\u2019 \u2018defeated,\u2019 \u2018overwhelmed,\u2019 \u2018anxious,\u2019 \n\u2018nervous,\u2019 \u2018stupid,\u2019 \u2018silly,\u2019 \u2018useless\u2019 and a \u2018failure.\u2019\u201d This depth of \ninformation, they explained, allows Facebook to pinpoint the time frame during \nwhich a young person needs a \u201cconfidence boost\u201d and is most vulnerable to a \nspecific configuration of subliminal cues and triggers. The data are then used \nto match each emotional phase with appropriate ad messaging for the maximum \nprobability of guaranteed sales. Facebook denied these practices, though a \nformer product manager accused the company of \u201clying through its teeth.\u201d The \nfact is that in the absence of corporate transparency and democratic oversight, \nepistemic inequality rules. They know. They decide who knows. They decide who \ndecides. The public\u2019s intolerable knowledge disadvantage is deepened by \nsurveillance capitalists\u2019 perfection of mass communications as gaslighting. Two \nexamples are illustrative. On April 30, 2019 Mark Zuckerberg made a dramatic \nannouncement at the company\u2019s annual developer conference, declaring, \u201cThe \nfuture is private.\u201d A few weeks later, a Facebook litigator appeared before a \nfederal district judge in California to thwart a user lawsuit over privacy \ninvasion, arguing that the very act of using Facebook negates any reasonable \nexpectation of privacy \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d In May 2019 Sundar Pichai, chief \nexecutive of Google, wrote in The Times of his corporations\u2019s commitment to the \nprinciple that \u201cprivacy cannot be a luxury good.\u201d Five months later Google \ncontractors were found offering $5 gift cards to homeless people of color in an \nAtlanta park in return for a facial scan. Facebook\u2019s denial invites even more \nscrutiny in light of another leaked company document appearing in 2018. The \nconfidential report offers rare insight into the heart of Facebook\u2019s \ncomputational factory, where a \u201cprediction engine\u201d runs on a machine \nintelligence platform that \u201cingests trillions of data points every day, trains \nthousands of models\u201d and then \u201cdeploys them to the server fleet for live \npredictions.\u201d Facebook notes that its \u201cprediction service\u201d produces \u201cmore than 6\n million predictions per second.\u201d But to what purpose? In its report, the \ncompany makes clear that these extraordinary capabilities are dedicated to \nmeeting its corporate customers\u2019 \u201ccore business challenges\u201d with procedures that\n link prediction, microtargeting, intervention and behavior modification. For \nexample, a Facebook service called \u201cloyalty prediction\u201d is touted for its \nability to plumb proprietary behavioral surplus to predict individuals who are \n\u201cat risk\u201d of shifting their brand allegiance and alerting advertisers to \nintervene promptly with targeted messages designed to stabilize loyalty just in \ntime to alter the course of the future. That year a young man named Christopher \nWylie turned whistle-blower on his former employer, a political consultancy \nknown as Cambridge Analytica. \u201cWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of \npeople\u2019s profiles,\u201d Wylie admitted, \u201cand built models to exploit what we knew \nabout them and target their inner demons.\u201d Mr. Wylie characterized those \ntechniques as \u201cinformation warfare,\u201d correctly assessing that such shadow wars \nare built on asymmetries of knowledge and the power it affords. Less clear to \nthe public or lawmakers was that the political firm\u2019s strategies of secret \ninvasion and conquest employed surveillance capitalism\u2019s standard operating \nprocedures to which billions of innocent \u201cusers\u201d are routinely subjected each \nday. Mr. Wylie described this mirroring process, as he followed a trail that was\n already cut and marked. Cambridge Analytica\u2019s real innovation was to pivot the \nwhole undertaking from commercial to political objectives. In other words, \nCambridge Analytica was the parasite, and surveillance capitalism was the host. \nThanks to its epistemic dominance, surveillance capitalism provided the \nbehavioral data that exposed the targets for assault. Its methods of behavioral \nmicrotargeting and behavioral modification became the weapons. And it was \nsurveillance capitalism\u2019s lack of accountability for content on its platform \nafforded by Section 230 that provided the opportunity for the stealth attacks \ndesigned to trigger the inner demons of unsuspecting citizens. It\u2019s not just \nthat epistemic inequality leaves us utterly vulnerable to the attacks of actors \nlike Cambridge Analytica. The larger and more disturbing point is that \nsurveillance capitalism has turned epistemic inequality into a defining \ncondition of our societies, normalizing information warfare as a chronic feature\n of our daily reality prosecuted by the very corporations upon which we depend \nfor effective social participation. They have the knowledge, the machines, the \nscience and the scientists, the secrets and the lies. All privacy now rests with\n them, leaving us with few means of defense from these marauding data invaders. \nWithout law, we scramble to hide in our own lives, while our children debate \nencryption strategies around the dinner table and students wear masks to public \nprotests as protection from facial recognition systems built with our family \nphotos. In the absence of new declarations of epistemic rights and legislation, \nsurveillance capitalism threatens to remake society as it unmakes democracy. \nFrom below, it undermines human agency, usurping privacy, diminishing autonomy \nand depriving individuals of the right to combat. From above, epistemic \ninequality and injustice are fundamentally incompatible with the aspirations of \na democratic people. We know that surveillance capitalists work in the shadows, \nbut what they do there and the knowledge they accrue are unknown to us. They \nhave the means to know everything about us, but we can know little about them. \nTheir knowledge of us is not for us. Instead, our futures are sold for others\u2019 \nprofits. Since that Federal Trade Commission meeting in 1997, the line was never\n drawn, and people did become chattel for commerce. Another destructive delusion\n is that this outcome was inevitable \u2014 an unavoidable consequence of \nconvenience-enhancing digital technologies. The truth is that surveillance \ncapitalism hijacked the digital medium. There was nothing inevitable about it. \nAmerican lawmakers have been reluctant to take on these challenges for many \nreasons. One is an unwritten policy of \u201csurveillance exceptionalism\u201d forged in \nthe aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when the government\u2019s concerns \nshifted from online privacy protections to a new zeal for \u201ctotal information \nawareness.\u201d In that political environment the fledgling surveillance \ncapabilities emerging from Silicon Valley appeared to hold great promise. \nSurveillance capitalists have also defended themselves with lobbying and forms \nof propaganda intended to undermine and intimidate lawmakers, confounding \njudgment and freezing action. These have received relatively little scrutiny \ncompared to the damage they do. Consider two examples: The first is the \nassertion that democracy threatens prosperity and innovation. Former Google \nchief executive Eric Schmidt explained in 2011, \u201cwe took the position of \u2018hands \noff the internet.\u2019 You know, leave us alone \u2026 The government can make regulatory\n mistakes that can slow this whole thing down, and we see that and we worry \nabout it.\u201d This propaganda is recycled from the Gilded Age barons, whom we now \ncall \u201crobbers.\u201d They insisted that there was no need for law when one had the \n\u201claw of survival of the fittest,\u201d the \u201claws of capital\u201d and the \u201claw of supply \nand demand.\u201d Paradoxically, surveillance capital does not appear to drive \ninnovation. A promising new era of economic research shows the critical role \nthat government and democratic governance have played in innovation and suggests\n a lack of innovation in big tech companies like Google. Surveillance \ncapitalism\u2019s information dominance is not dedicated to the urgent challenges of \ncarbon-free energy, eliminating hunger, curing cancers, ridding the oceans of \nplastic or flooding the world with well paid, smart, loving teachers and \ndoctors. Instead, we see a frontier operation run by geniuses with vast capital \nand computational power that is furiously dedicated to the lucrative science and\n economics of human prediction for profit. The second form of propaganda is the \nargument that the success of the leading surveillance capitalist firms reflects \nthe real value they bring to people. But data from the demand side suggest that \nsurveillance capitalism is better understood as a market failure. Instead of a \nclose alignment of supply and demand, people use these services because they \nhave no comparable alternatives and because they are ignorant of surveillance \ncapitalism\u2019s shadow operations and their consequences. Pew Research Center \nrecently reported that 81 percent of Americans believe the potential risks of \ncompanies\u2019 data collection outweigh the benefits, suggesting that corporate \nsuccess depends upon coercion and obfuscation rather than meeting people\u2019s real \nneeds. In his prizewinning history of regulation, the historian Thomas McCraw \ndelivers a warning. Across the centuries regulators failed when they did not \nframe \u201cstrategies appropriate to the particular industries they were \nregulating.\u201d Existing privacy and antitrust laws are vital but neither will be \nwholly adequate to the new challenges of reversing epistemic inequality. These \ncontests of the 21st century demand a framework of epistemic rights enshrined in\n law and subject to democratic governance. Such rights would interrupt data \nsupply chains by safeguarding the boundaries of human experience before they \ncome under assault from the forces of datafication. The choice to turn any \naspect of one\u2019s life into data must belong to individuals by virtue of their \nrights in a democratic society. This means, for example, that companies cannot \nclaim the right to your face, or use your face as free raw material for \nanalysis, or own and sell any computational products that derive from your face.\n The conversation on epistemic rights has already begun, reflected in a \npathbreaking report from Amnesty International. On the demand side, we can \noutlaw human futures markets and thus eliminate the financial incentives that \nsustain the surveillance dividend. This is not a radical prospect. For example, \nsocieties outlaw markets that trade in human organs, babies and slaves. In each \ncase, we recognize that such markets are both morally repugnant and produce \npredictably violent consequences. Human futures markets can be shown to produce \nequally predictable outcomes that challenge human freedom and undermine \ndemocracy. Like subprime mortgages and fossil fuel investments, surveillance \nassets will become the new toxic assets. In support of a new competitive \nlandscape, lawmakers will need to champion new forms of collective action, just \nas nearly a century ago legal protections for the rights to organize, to strike \nand to bargain collectively united lawmakers and workers in curbing the powers \nof monopoly capitalists. Lawmakers must seek alliances with citizens who are \ndeeply concerned over the unchecked power of the surveillance capitalists and \nwith workers who seek fair wages and reasonable security in defiance of the \nprecarious employment conditions that define the surveillance economy. Anything \nmade by humans can be unmade by humans. Surveillance capitalism is young, barely\n 20 years in the making, but democracy is old, rooted in generations of hope and\n contest. Surveillance capitalists are rich and powerful, but they are not \ninvulnerable. They have an Achilles heel: fear. They fear lawmakers who do not \nfear them. They fear citizens who demand a new road forward as they insist on \nnew answers to old questions: Who will know? Who will decide who knows? Who will\n decide who decides? Who will write the music, and who will dance?

            "full_text": " Jeff Bezos\u2019 Phone Hack Should Terrify Everyone Those \nwith the most to lose don\u2019t always safeguard their privacy very well. You can do\n better. By Charlie Warzel Mr. Warzel is an opinion writer at large If the Saudi\n crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, wants to chat on WhatsApp, politely decline.\n That\u2019s the lesson from a series of reports this week based off a forensic \nexamination of Jeff Bezos\u2019 communications with the crown prince. The \ninvestigation \u2014 conducted at Mr. Bezos\u2019 request by FTI Consulting \u2014 found that \nhis phone had most likely been attacked in 2018 after he received a WhatsApp \nmessage from the prince\u2019s personal account. While my colleagues in the Times \nnewsroom have pieced together details of the investigation, there\u2019s still a \ngreat deal unknown. And cybersecurity experts have serious questions about FTI\u2019s\n report, which, according to CyberScoop, \u201chas not impressed the information \nsecurity community.\u201d Still, the story seems to have everything: from \nlighthearted, embarrassingly earnest texts, \u201cdivorced guy\u201d memes and world \nleaders who awkwardly sign their text messages with their full names to the \ndeeply problematic issue of revenge porn and stealing of private nude photos. \nThough it\u2019s a gilded example of digital theft, there\u2019s something troubling and \nrelatable about it all. Billionaires, they\u2019re just like us! Or maybe not. Looked\n at one way, the attack on Mr. Bezos\u2019 phone could be seen as yet more proof of \nwhat my colleague Kara Swisher called \u201cthe death of privacy.\u201d If the richest man\n in the world \u2014 the man who sells listening devices used in millions of homes \nand whose servers create the internet\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 can be hacked, what \nhope is there for us mere mortals? Turns out, there\u2019s some. Yes, your personal \nprivacy and security are constantly under threat. And yes, you should be trying \nto safeguard against malware, phishing and bulk data collection. But the Bezos \nattack is an example of extremely targeted surveillance, the potentially \nexpensive and risky kind that is aimed at high-value targets like executives, \ngovernment officials, celebrities and billionaires. And as it turns out, many of\n those with the most to lose are woefully inept at safeguarding their privacy. \nNot long after the Bezos news broke this week, I spoke to Christopher Pierson, \nwho founded BlackCloak, a cybersecurity company for high-net-worth and high-\nprofile individuals \u2014 executives, celebrities and billionaires. According to Mr.\n Pierson, few people take their digital lives as seriously as they should. \u201cThe \nmajority of clients we onboard come on in some kind of hacked state,\u201d he told \nme. \u201cTheir computers are compromised or their login credentials are available on\n dark web. Their home camera systems are accessible to people on internet or \ntheir entire home and appliances are vulnerable and viewable by persons \nremotely.\u201d Mr. Pierson suggests that\u2019s in part because high-value targets choose\n to focus on physical security over digital and invest in private bodyguards, \ncamera systems and protections like kidnapping insurance. How bad is it? \u201cWe see\n passwords in little black books on desks by the machines and in files on the \ncomputers. We see passwords that are the same everywhere. We absolutely do not \nsee good use of dual factor authentication on email, health care and financial \naccounts. I\u2019d say we see less than 1 percent of high-net-worth individuals using\n dual factor.\u201d Mr. Pierson said BlackCloak has found more than 82 percent of its\n clients\u2019 current passwords on the dark web when it ran an initial search. \u201cIn \nthe case of high-net-worth individuals, the same compromised password is \nfrequently used by 20 to 40 different accounts \u2014 some of those are personal, \nsome are in the office.\u201d What Mr. Pierson describes is low-hanging fruit \u2014 the \nkind of security flaws that can quickly be fixed with a little knowledge and \nattention to detail. Even then, he said, it takes time for the true nature of \nclients\u2019 vulnerability to sink in. \u201cThey\u2019re shocked when we give them their \npassword and tell them where we found it, but it doesn\u2019t hit as hard as when we \ntell them their entire home automation system has been potentially online and \nviewable for three or five or eight years,\u201d he said. When it comes to a Bezos-\nstyle breach \u2014 potentially at the hands of a nation-state\u2019s intelligence service\n \u2014 high-profile targets would most likely be even less prepared. As Mr. Bezos\u2019 \nlengthy investigation into the 2018 attack shows, it\u2019s difficult to get straight\n answers even when you have the money and resources to run full forensics. Of \ncourse, it\u2019s not just wealth that turns somebody into a person of interest for \nhackers. Journalists, government employees, workers at energy companies and \nutilities could all be targets for someone. Those who work for financial \ncompanies, airlines, hospitals, universities, Hollywood studios and tech \nbusinesses are all potentially at risk. You can take steps to secure yourself \nfrom corporate data collection by using privacy settings on your phone. And to \nprotect yourself from cyberattacks there are helpful guides you can use that \nhave been vetted by security professionals. For most of us, the attack against \nMr. Bezos isn\u2019t the death of privacy, but a reminder of the risks of living a \nconnected life. It should be a moment to think as critically about what you do \nonline as you might in the real world. Invest in a password manager. Turn on \ndual factor authentication. Be skeptical of any communication that looks out of \nplace. For the ultrarich and influential, the Bezos hack should be a terrifying \nrevelation. As the former State Department employee and whistle-blower John \nNapier Tye told me last autumn, \u201cFor someone who\u2019s truly a high-value target, \nthere is no way to safely use a digital device.\u201d The stakes are astronomically \nhigh. Not just personally, as Mr. Bezos found, but professionally. Company \nsecrets, matters of national security, access to critical infrastructure and the\n safety of employees could all be compromised by lax security at the top. The \ninternet has long been thought of as a truly democratic tool, flattening and \ndemocratizing the ability to publish and communicate. It\u2019s also the great \nprivacy equalizer. Money can buy a lot of things. But on a dangerous internet \nfull of exploits, flawed code, shady actors and absent-minded humans, total, \nfoolproof security is not one of them.
