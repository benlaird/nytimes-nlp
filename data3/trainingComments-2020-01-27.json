But there was another mass extinction before the rise of the dinosaurs, scientists didn\u2019t know what had caused this mass die off, so they dug down below the K-2 level (the K-2 level is the visible line created by the material that fell back to earth after the asteroid.) They discovered that the earth had a sudden burst of greenhouse gasses over about 100 years, the gasses were caused by volcanic activity. They found crystals that volcanos form when the erupt, and scientists discovered that small amount of air is trapped inside the crystal. The decided to see if they could analyze that air, to see if they could measure the Co2 levels, methane, and compare it to how much Co2, methane, and other green house gasses are in today\u2019s atmosphere. \n\nWhat they found was, sobering. What they discovered was, there is more Co2 and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere today, than there was in the fourth extinction. As the level of greenhouse gasses rise, the ocean absorbs it, as the ocean water become acidic, animals can\u2019t form shell. Diatoms are one of the largest and ecologically most significant groups of organisms on Earth, they couldn\u2019t form their shells, the oceans food supply died. \n\n<a href=\"http://tolweb.org/Diatoms\" target=\"_blank\">http://tolweb.org/Diatoms</a>/",

The air in the crystals showed that it was greenhouse gasses, from volcanic activity over 100 years or so the set the stage for the fourth mass extinction. But when compared to the levels of greenhouse gasses today, there is more greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere today, than 100 million years ago. The same circumstances existed then, as the do today. As the ocean absorbed the Co2 it became more acidic, the higher acid, animals that grow shells, can\u2019t grow shells, coral cant form their calcium shells, the fish that depend on coral reefs, die, those small fish are food for larger fish and so on. The most abundant shelled creature that forms the basis of the food chain, the diatom. When a diatom dies, it releases oxygen into the atmosphere. Trees also scrub the air we breathe taking out Co2 among other things, but it\u2019s the tiny diatom that\u2019s the real producer of the oxygen we breath. In the fourth extinction, as the planet heated up, the food supply was interrupted, eventually killing all life on earth. Then came the dinosaurs and they reigned Supreme for thousands of years, until an six mile wide asteroid traveling at 50,000 miles an hour became a meteor slamming into the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. \n\n<a href=\"http://tolweb.org/Diatoms\" target=\"_blank\">http://tolweb.org/Diatoms</a>/\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about economics this is about the earths survival, and human species survival.",

            "comment_body": "Thanks, Not sure that most people know of the Republicans constantly trying to defund Amtrak in this country. Many people would I believe use passenger service if was more available and had more funding to upgrade the trains themselves. We have only one passenger train going through Wisconsin which goes once a day each direction though the state, the Empire Builder. Coming from the west coast starting in Washington state by the time it gets to Wisconsin on the way to Chicago it is usually running hours late making it difficult to make any connections. It doesn't even go through our capital Madison. The government subsidizes the airlines and roads but the republicans would like to defund Amtrak where there are 20,000 workers. Defunding Amtrak would make Amtrak fail in most parts of the country. Yes the East coast corridors passenger trains would survive but not most of the other parts of the country. When we ride the rails the trains are full and many times totally booked despite the difficultly Amtrak faces every day. The workers on the train are hard working and dedicated and quite wonderful. Checking out a possibly trip to Portugal in the future I noticed there are 40 passenger trains a day between Lisbon and Porto. We can do better here. We are so glad to have gotten rid a few nasty Republicans lately in our state, Paul Ryan and governor, Walker. Hopefully with the next election we can move forward again to help the climate and the state of passenger rail .",

Allow me to explain.  We cannot at present, store utility grade quantities of power except as small demonstration projects.  That means that Solar and Wind power generation requires either nuclear or carbon based power at night or on overcast still days, the kind that occur regularly during winter.  Nuclear power is non-carbon, but at least in the US, we have no storage for the long lived and dangerous spent fuel.  That leaves the spent fuel sitting at the power stations, many in or near major cities.\n\nClaims of 100% renewable power generation are mostly illusions.  In California for instance there are claims of 100% renewable power.  The way they achieve this is to produce power during the day with solar and wind.  At night they still need power from natural gas power plants, but since the power they produce during the day exceeds the power they buy at night, they claim 100% renewable power!!!  Isn't creative accounting wonderful??!!  BTW, a teeny detail, because we can't store power, at times California has to pay, other states to take our power.\n\nPower economics is complex.  Myself I would rather spend the $ Billions Trump is going to spend towards his wall on research to make solar and wind reliable power sources.",

It is a long range problem and demands a long range solution.\n\nAnd shifting from fossil fuels is a big part of the problem.  But it isn't the only consideration.\n\nThe reason for global warming is not the development of the internal combustion engine, but population growth.  This problem was pointed out by Thomas Malthus in 1798 when world population was less that a billion and again in 1968 when Paul Ehrlich published \"the Population Bomb,\" when world population was about 3.5 billion.\n\nPopulation has more than doubled since 1968.\n\nThere is no viable solution to global warming without also tackling the overpopulation problem.\n\nAn increasing population increases the demand for energy which increases use of fossil fuels, even as we try to develop solar and wind energy.\n\nIndeed, some global warming is already baked into the cake.  World temperatures will increase some no matter what we do.  That will change the climate, particularly of the regions of planet earth near the equator.\n\nThat will DECREASE carrying capacity of planet earth.\n\nWe will pay dearly for neglecting the warning that we needed to use birth control.",

History shows the view of government as a source of negative externalities, including the bombing of children in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the killing of Jews in Auschwitz.\nThe economists might be working with a different conception of government than that of the historians, leading to their prescriptions. Or perhaps they have more moral tolerance for government's negative externalities than is ethically correct.\nSimilar to statements such as, \"assume perfect knowledge\", looking where that leads, before rejecting that assumption, they may be assuming \"good government\", but don't get rid of that assumption, failing to take the knowledge of historians into account.\nIf, as I suspect, they use an unrealistic view of government, this may be due to divisions and specialization in academia in different departments, resulting in ethically questionable doctrines.",

Cost, changes in the supply chain, sometimes technical feasibility. Government administrators, who were largely clueless, as were the staffs of congress, would not know where the absolute truth would reside. Eventually, as part of the process, industry would end up moving significantly in the right direction. And the environment was always better. Yes, the consumer sometimes paid a high cost for such products, but usually the benefits were worth it. This ratcheting effect actually produced excellent results starting as far back as the early 1970s. Yes, I am that old. But now we are at a tipping point. The normal time period for incremental improvements is too lengthy. Greta is correct, as is Paul. Mnuchin is not and is an ignorant defender of the past. Greta\u2019s job is too push beyond what seems possible. Others do know how to get there. The problem is those that do not want their gifting to end. But end it must, one way or another.

Today, nearly every woke economist makes the same claims about the potential of green energy, the next panacea. Inevitably, this new energy sector will present its own set of problems, like for instance, the depletion of rare earth minerals that are essential to the energy storage business. Rare is the economist that will argue that economic growth in itself is a bad thing, when in fact it is the main cause of the despoliation of our planet. In 2050, powered by green energy or not, there will still be around 10 billion people, all aspiring to live a lifestyle that Mother Earth will be hard pressed to provide.",

My impression is that the recent mitigation of energy prices is due to fracking, and not to heavily subsidized wind and solar, as claimed by Mr. Krugman. \n\nOnly hydro and nuclear power can provide the 24/7 alternative that will save the world from the catastrophic consequences of the Paris Agreement's zero-net-emissions goal for 2050.  Hydro is geographically limited (and is environmentally costly in its own right), so that leaves nuclear for most of the world.  \n\nModern nuclear designs, and in particular thorium-based plants, are, according to their proponents, much safer than Fukushima-era plants, which required active measures to prevent overheating.  These proponents include the late physicist James Hansen, who was no less passionate and activist about CO2 emissions than Ms. Thunberg.  Their claims should be carefully vetted, but definitely deserve to be taken seriously.    \n\nAs an economist, I did sign the recent economists' letter on a carbon tax, but not without reservations that I expressed in a Beacon blogpost that can be accessed by searching for \"Welfare Obelisk\".",

Considering that the future impacts of unabated climate change on the U.S. will be even costlier than in many other developed countries and that U.S. companies have the knowledge and technology to lead and even benefit from combating climate change, the current administration clearly goes strongly against the country's own best interests.\n\nAnd here Mr. Krugman is spot on when he says that greed and selfishness, as well as ignorance, are at the root of the behavior of Mr Mnuchin and Trump and allies. Thirty years after the IPCC released its first report, the science and the evidence base are clear. So if there is one current issue that quite clearly separates those who care about future generations and those who do not, it is climate change.",

To paraphrase John McCain, Stop, baby, stop! Drilling, that is. Then, put the money that was going into a cracking plant or an oil pipeline into windmills, solar panels, insulation, and research. Hire the people who were drilling and building pipelines to build sustainable energy systems.\n\nThe changes we will need to make are profound, which is what the Green New Deal is all about.

The idea that cutting corporate taxes  will lead to an economic expansion and that the expansion alone will cover any fall in tax receipts, something never proven, is at the core of Republican thinking. Republicans also see government regulation as another form of taxation and so it is natural that any regulations, even if in response to environmental pollution or climate change will not only be opposed but seen as a threat to the american economy.\n\nThe idea of regulations and innovations in fossil fuel use to address climate change comes out of good science,  but what Mnuchin wants is for Thunberg to embrace non-thinking , and to forget about what the trend line in climate science is showing , because it shows that looking the other way is a sure prescription for disaster. \n\nMnuchin is doing all he can to get people from asking indelicate questions about the ballooning american deficit and why the expansion is slowing. Could it be that the reason is that Trump wants to run on the economy and that weakness in the economy might reflect poorly on his managerial skills? Could it be that he is afraid to discuss  new regulations if climate is to be addressed, it could also be that he is afraid to discus taxes...maybe this is why he likes attacking  Thunberg after all , all she talks about is science !",

A study by the European Wind Energy Association claimed that global subsidies in renewables was roughly $90B per year in 2011.  So, I see a (very) rough ratio of 5:1 in direct public spending towards fossil fuels versus green energy.\n\nI don't want to discount in any way the very-important point Dr Krugman makes in highlighting the indirect costs of global fossil fuel use (the lion's share of the annual $5.2T which he and Vox quote), but it still steams me that we human beings are consciously and actively spending five times more money in feeding our fossil fuel addition than we are in combating it.\n\nThe cherry-on-top of kicking our addiction to fossil fuels is that we will also emerge from under the authoritarian thumb of plutocrats.  Fossil fuel sales account for about 70% of Russia's export revenues, and I don't think one has to be too much of a conspiracy theorist to connect the stories of surreptitious Russian support for our current corrupt Administration to our Administration's blind eye towards climate issues and apparent love of fossil fuels.\n\nLet's stop holding the hand that holds us down.

Full cycle is accounting for all costs, from exploration to incorporating the costs of the waste of what they sell. The cost of keeping global temperatures steady, the cost of clean air, all the costs. If they were required to do that via a tax, their product would quickly be replaced by renewables that have a much lower total cost.

The closer you get to the goal line, the more likely you are to score, because the long pass or run is no longer necessary.\nThis acceleration of growth applies not only to the warming of the planet but the monetary cost of fighting it off.

Use a map and measure a familiar landmark distance to comprehend this. Some cynics will say that's pretty far. It's about 16,000 feet. Now go out and visualize that distance, perhaps to a mountain or a coast across a lake. To those that may think it's a lot of atmosphere, I tell you not when you consider the century plus we have polluted it, starting with coal and on to oil and now carcinogenic chemicals that kill unknown. Imagine that distance. That's all we have.\n\nAnd the water. All that pollution finds it's way ultimately into all water. For example; a coal fired power plant emits sulfur that was in the coal, especially bituminous found out west, and that sulfur joins with water molecules in clouds that ultimately coalesce around dust and pollution particles and form rain drops. That rain then enters the environment as sulfuric acid. It kills trees and water borne life. Whole forests have been destroyed. \n\nKeep the faith though to inspire you. Even Trump this week proposed planting a Trillion trees. That's a good meeting point for all of us. He is learning as we do. Thank you for inspiring him and us as well.",

The amount of energy that is delivered by fossil fuels is far greater than what people understand.  Switching to air source heat pumps in cold climates just moves carbon emissions and increases them.  It also puts many more devices into use that are loaded with refrigerants with up to 600 times the Global Warming Potential of methane.  A report was released last week that refrigerants are responsible for 50% of Arctic ice melt so the solutions are not clear as he believes.   Germany has been transitioning off of fossil fuels for 30 years and their carbon footprint  has not gone down for the last 8 years  Part of it is the closing of their nuclear plants, but it is also because they have brought the CO2 footprints  of their residences down by  28% during that time by switching to heat pumps. That put more load on  their fossil fuel generating plants so the CO2 emissions moved  there and increased.  They can't install renewable generation fast enough to keep up.  Storage technology to support a renewable infrastructure is many years away.  Plus many of the people that most want these renewable technologies installed don't want them where they live.  They want someone else to deal with it.  Until these issues are addressed, there will be major difficulties in transitioning to a renewable energy system.",

More growth will still mean more consumption, more biodiversity loss, resource depletion, air and water pollution, hazardous waste, fisheries collapse and on and on. There is no evidence to suggest that economic growth can be completely decoupled from resource consumption, nor has this ever happened to my knowledge. \n\nThe answer is staring us in the face. Stop growing and start sharing. Rich countries are plenty rich enough. We just do a lousy job of sharing the wealth. Poorer countries still need to grow of course, but even then, there is a limit to how big the global economy can become on a finite planet. And quite likely we have already surpassed this limit.",

But on the flip side, and considering the source, Ms Thunberg should consider it a badge of honor.  She is so above this nitwit Mnuchin, in character, maturity, and now in the study of economics.  But to dig a little deeper, I ask where are all those fiscal conservatives who under President Obama predicted nothing short of Armageddon with a rising deficit?  And now...the silence is deafening that under the \"leadership\" of Trump Inc our deficit has climbed to over $1 trillion dollars, \"75% higher than it was in 2016.\"  Unconscionable greed is the culprit buried within the DNA of our oligarchs and anointed monarch sitting on his throne in the Oval Office.  But here is the deal.  Greta is the future, she and millions of our younger generations who are smarter and wiser \"grown-ups\" already, with ethics and moral compasses, too.",

He changed the name to OneWest Bank and rebuilt the bank, then sold it to CIT Group in 2015.

He is no economist. There is a huge difference in approach, outlook and purpose between banking and economic policy making.\n\nGreta Thunberg is a precocious, highly intelligent, empathetic young lady who will go very far.

Greta's generation will make Mnuchin and his co-conspirators answer for their crimes against humanity.\n\nThis weekend, there was news that Mnuchin's wife tweeted in support of Thunberg and then deleted her tweet. That, in my mind, just goes to show how unwise these oligarchs are in their personal associations as well as business. If your life mate doesn't share your values, then... ?\n\nTrump will come to an end. It is up to us to replace him with a president who will move us out of the perilous position we are currently in, in a principled and steadfast manner.\n\nThe dealmaking, triangulating and compromising of the last 40 years got us into the muck we are up to our eyeballs in.

What do you think about that idea, Dr. Krugman?   Or how about a column on how government procurement programs could give a boost to green manufacturing?   I\u2019d also be excited to see more columns on regulations.   What is the best way to hasten the transition to electric vehicles?   What is the best way to ensure that new construction is energy efficient?   And then there is land use.   How can we fix the farm bill to discourage the overproduction of commodity crops?

The future always lies in innovation. We must let it happen, and remove from power those who stubbornly oppose the brighter future that the Earth can have.",

But we need to recognize too that Democrats can do more. \nThere isn't a single American city with a Low Emission Zone, whereas almost every major European city has one.

Wasting minutes for cars that shouldn't be there. And the sidewalks are too narrow, just so cars have multiple lanes in each direction. Our lakefront is basically 8 lanes of highway, spewing carcinogenic fumes into the lungs of every runner and cyclist on the popular adjacent lakefront trail. It only serves to accommodate the suburbs at the expense of Chicago inhabitants and despite budget problems, it's not even a toll road.\nI only noticed because I moved here from Europe, but it's striking unless you've never seen different.\nEurope on the other hand is moving forward fast, with some midsize cities now banning traffic completely from its centers (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/20/the-streets-are-more-alive-ghent-readers-on-a-car-free-city-centre\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/20/the-streets-are-more-alive-ghent-readers-on-a-car-free-city-centre</a>) and it works.",

The will be no fraud too ugly to be committed and then supported by those who will profit from it or terrified to oppose it. And if he gets away with it and is then re-elected, by fair means or foul, he will have joined autocrats like Putin and Xi and Erdogan who make a mockery of the democratic ambitions of the citizens of their countries.

It's completely ridiculous because the impeachment is about what to do when a President acts contrary to limits to the authority given to the President and clearly violates the oath of office.  When a President exceeds the authority granted to him/her, the oath of office is broken but it need not be a specifically forbidden act, which is what statutes provide.

This was eminently clear in the House impeachment proceeding, but the House dropped the ball. Their reason - they didn't want to delay moving forward - was misguided. What was the hurry? The longer this drags out the more pressure is placed on Republicans to do the right thing. Moreover, it short-circuited the discovery of additional evidence and testimony - as we've seen in the time since it went to the Senate. Holding onto the Impeachment Articles would've also kept pressure on Trump and perhaps kept him distracted enough to keep him from making more nation and world-affecting decisions. Also, it would've enabled the House to add further articles as evidence and testimony came to light. Finally, the longer this takes, the longer Trump cannot claim \"vindication\", and the closer it gets to November, the fresher his treachery will be in voter's minds.\n\nPerhaps America will get lucky, and Chief Justice Roberts will save us from this Trump stonewall, aided by the Republicans. It will take action on his part because the Republicans will not yield. They know in their hearts Trump is guilty, and the are terrified of having to vote to remove him, or have no cover to hide behind. So, the real question is: Does Justice Roberts have the courage to administer justice?",

Republicans tried this with Clinton.  Republicans certainly stated this openly with Obama.  Witness the statement from McConnell about making Obama a one-term president.  Every racist trope possible was used by Republicans to limit the effectiveness and duration of the Obama presidency.  \n\nI wish people would read history and the Constitution.  The whole point of impeachment, as envisioned by the Founders, was to provide a remedy when a president fails in his duty to the people.  If that president is outrageous enough in his/her behavior or dereliction of duty, impeachment is the process.  It is not \"nullification\" of the 2016 election, but it is people speaking out.  \n\nTrump's defense team today queried whether this process would open the doors to impeachment as a matter of political revenge, such that the opposition will always move for impeachment over trivialities.  The answer is clearly no.  The House must ground impeachment on fact, and if a significant percentage of the US population thinks that the President has been dishonorable or deplorable in a major way, impeachment will occur.",

If politics could be kept on performance, Trump would fail miserably---he cannot even lead his own cabinet.  But Democrats are bound and determined to fight a culture war even if it results in their defeat.\n\nThe Me Too movement is a particular example of this.  Harvey Weinstein may indeed be guilty of rape.  But Brett Kavanaugh?  Can't people see that the evidence was weak?  Why force Al Franken to resign?\n\nDue Process was written into our Bill of Rights because the founders were well aware of how the powers that be could influence trials.

Getting caught is merely a cost of doing business.\nFurthermore, the legitimacy of the impeachment hearings lies not in the Constitution, but in the hands of those who want to pursue justice or who wish to avoid the truth.\nIn a way, Trump is right.

More damning than the Ukraine maneuvers I think has been Trump's subsequent cover-up and his orders to defy some seventy-one subpoenas for types of documents involving six federal agencies and instructing ten different federal employees to ignore subpoenas requiring them to appear before the House of Representatives. Republicans assert that Trump has the right to fight those subpoenas forever even though Trump's arguments thus far have lost in both district and the court of appeals. If that conduct is allowed then Trump's attorneys will ask the appeals court to hear it en banque, then the Supreme Court,  which even if it too rules against Trump would likely send it back to the district court as is customary. And even if that didn't happen Trump's team stands ready to simply raise another issue however absurd. No, if a president decides to act as Trump does obstructing the ability of the House to conduct its impeachment inquiry then the proper remedy is impeachment based on that obstruction of Congress. And holding a misbehaving president accountable does not overturn an election because his vice president succeeds him not his past opponent. Nor does it interfere with the coming election because voters have the right to a write-in candidate and how hard is it to spell Pence if that's their choice?",

The witness charade will prolong the case and just as the house wanted to wrap up their impeachment articles in a casket and find that they are dead on arrival in the senate, the senate has equal right to refuse to do what the house failed to do. The rule of law has to prevail and the law was violated by the house in not allowing the judiciary to decide whether Bolton should testify.",

The hyper-partisan realities only play into the hands of the defense by tainting the articles of impeachment with party-line votes. It is likely that the same partisanship will play out in the Senate, first in any votes on witnesses and evidence, and later in the failure to achieve conviction. \n\nPinning our hopes on a ruling from the presiding officer or the votes of four GOP senators to defy their caucus just shows how far we have fallen from the laws and rules meant to protect our republic.",

The framers thought Liberty (also capitalized, like Justice) must be exercised in the present to promoting \"Liberty\" in the future, cultivation of those conditions to ensure that the experiment in democratic self-governance structured by a Constitution does not decay, deteriorate or atrophy, but continually thrives & grows in fuller realization of these aspirations. Justice Roberts affirmed this advocating for strengthened civic education.\n\nThis message would be heightened now by more robust Judicial assertiveness on 3 things: \"Rule of Law\" (in which \"nobody, not even the president, is 'above the law'\"; \"Checks & Balances\"- requiring in this case the Judicial Branch to hold the Executive & Legislative Branches to high legal standards, including matters like the Impoundment Control Act, Power of the Purse, & Impeachment Proceedings.\n\nAs to the inclusion or exclusion of witnesses, Justice Roberts should recognize witnesses, discovery, & evidence are essential to a truth-based, justice-focused outcome.",

Could it be that Trump did so in an attempt to please and appease Bolton?\n\nTrump wouldn't do such a thing--have someone assassinated and then lie about why he did it--just to try to help himself, would he?!?\n\nMr. Chief Justice, do your job.  Call witnesses--including Bolton, Mulvaney, and Pompeo--and demand the immediate production of all of the documents Trump has illegally withheld.  If you fail to do so, both your name and that of SCOTUS will be mud.  You will have destroyed the Constitution and will have ushered in a vicious autocracy.",

If the Republicans are violating their oath administered by Justice Roberts, & Justice Roberts administered that oath under oath himself to administer/preside over a fair trial. Doesn't Justice Roberts violate his own oath to permit all this? The Constitution clearly places sacred importance on this oath procedure. Person A takes an oath, then immediately administers an oath to party B. That means Person A is SWEARING to hold party B to their oath, which becomes his own! This makes Justice Roberts personally responsible for Senators acting in good faith. So how can he tolerate a witness-less, evidence-less, truth-less, justice-less (which this must be, given any reasonable definition of a legitimate trial) trial? Given yesterday's developments, Justice Roberts may well be in violation of his oath, sad to say. Where does that leave us, if these oaths are reduced to hollow ceremony? One answer is \"exactly where an insincere presidential oath of office leaves us.\" But not exactly.

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe, as a concerned citizen, [it may be warranted] to consider whether Your Honor has been too passive in this proceeding, allowing important judicial principles [importance of witnesses an evidence] to be betrayed. I believe the presiding Judge has discretion to either subpoena a witness (John Bolton) or invite an amicus curiae brief from him or any other party, on the Court's own motion. That is part of the Judge's discretion in any trial. I admit I'm a layman, hardly in a position to lecture a Chief Justice on such matters, but it is my impression. I hope it will at least be considered.\"",

Chief Justice swears to preside over a trial meeting this standard, & exacts an oath from participants to do their part. This set-up prevents him from tolerating shoddiness/bad faith on their part, vis-a-vis his own professional sense of what a real trial entails. He is under oath to hold all concerned to high legal (procedural & substantive) standards, whatever this/these entail. Anything less than that, he is in violation of his oath. Not only that...\n\nNot only that, but \"checks and balances\" fails. Checks & balances is 3-way here. He represents the Judicial Branch in holding the Executive accountable. If he makes himself a wallflower in the proceeding (the occasional admonition about decorum not withstanding), he really betrays a) his oath, b) \"checks and balances, c) the Constitution, in a way, as seriously as Trump has, by abetting it.",

Everyone knows that he did and why. Everyone also knows that the GOP will not vote to remove him from office. BUT the question of it was wrong needs to be established. If it is OK for a president to disperse funds in any way he chooses, to claim executive privilege for everything he does or for anyone who helps him, why even have a Congress?\n\nCongress is exactly the sort of cumbersome barrier to absolute control that Trump never had to deal with as master of his own business. Sure, there's this pesky thing called the Constitution but, really, it's SOOO yesterday. Think of the money and time saved by letting Trump control the budget and taxes and everything else the federal government does. The executive branch already controls the military, the Justice Department, and Treasury, and its \"enforcement\" of all laws and regulations gives it, in essence, control of them as well. So why not just cut out the bickering partisan, middlemen? Trump is, after all, a stable genius.\n\nIf GOP leaders refuse to declare his action was wrong, as it did with Clinton, and Nixon, any pretense remaining for checks and balances and all those other pesky parts of the Constitution, will be little more than historical trivia.",

I believe they only want to weaken Trump for 2020 knowing that conviction in the Senate is a pipe dream.

If Roberts is true to form within this context, there's no hope for anything but what the Republicans want.  Someone in place would have to be of immense integrity in order to go against it.

By contrast, President Barack Obama stated that the decision \"gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington\". The ruling had a major impact on campaign finance, allowing unlimited election spending by corporations and labor unions and fueling the rise of Super PACs. Later rulings by the Roberts Court, including McCutcheon v. FEC (2014), would strike down other campaign finance restrictions.\"\n\nPOTUS Trump and Republican Senators (House) OWE their political existence to PAC money; murky backchannels funding tens of millions. Trump is an obscene example of election funding gone corrupt. (Read the Trump Inaugural Committee funding.) It's totally pay to play.\n\nRepublicans are owned by wealthy - mostly unknown - donor class.

Rand Paul announced today he was formally inviting the Defendant to the Senate to participate and was / is pushing a motion to dismiss, long before the trial commenced or any evidence considered. He is even tweeting the pictures of the gallery ticket.  In the history of American law, a criminal defendant has never been permitted to actively coordinate with an impartial juror during the trial. The only hope our Republic has for survival, uncorrupted, is if the Judicial branch reinterprets the power to Preside as found in the U.S. Constitution to include ruling on qualified jurors. The resultant qualified jurors, who do not already have a record of expressing their opinion on conviction, can then continue to set the rules and override the Chief Justice on issues of materiality by majority vote, if they so choose. It would be a case of first impression for the judiciary. Right now the Chief Justice's role is meaningless, merely ministerial. If Presidement is to have any substantive meaning at all, it must include ruling on juror coordination, with the Defendant, and bias. We suggested this idea in Dec",

Did he have any dreams when he got the job, aspirations to make the world a better place? Or was he told during his job interview that his role would be to guard the legal flank while his benefactors dispossessed the middle class and sent the poor's children to die in ginned-up wars?\n\nOne might think that even a marionette has dreams.\n\nJohn Bolton might be a loathsome throwback to Reagan's fascination with anything fascistic, but even prevaricators shed light in their quest to illuminate their own imagined good qualities. Roberts is confronted with a black and white image, words written by a right-wing warrior that inculpate a sleazy grifter who brought every one of his socially destructive skills from an executive suite in a condemned building to the Oval Office. Now John Roberts has to decide whether the evidence Bolton offers will echo down the ages condemning a Chief Justice who, when given the opportunity, confirmed the worst suspicions of his peers.\n\nThis is Plessy v. Ferguson, John. Short term gain, long term shame? The choice is yours.",

But in the end it doesn\u2019t really matter, because I believe President Trump will be re-elected.",

In doing so the court provided an outcome that essentially shaped its own formation, making it a political institution.  Likewise the court failed to rule on the obstruction of the Merrick Garland appointment.

Does that sound familiar?\n\nAs a consequence, the court is now looked upon as\u2019 illegitimate\u2019 in the eyes of many Americans. The Supreme Court has become a political institution just like the executive and the legislative branches.  We can hope, as Mr. Katyal has, that Justice John Roberts will step up and do the right thing in this third exemplary example.  But hope has not prevailed in recent times.

They are acting like a bunch of spoiled rich kids who don't give a hoot what the public, Republicans or Democrats--might think.\n\nThere's no going back on a decision to be bribed.  All these Senators can do is ride the traitorous wind--if they can win re-election by backing Trump, then all the better.

The case can clearly be made for the House Managers to ask for witnesses, given the solid information that has come to light \ufffcrecently (Bolton\u2019s book and the video of the dinner attended by Lev Parnas and Igor Furman, to name just two things that came out after the House voted on articles of impeachment).  If someone came forth with evidence as solid as this showing that Hunter Biden was actively corrupt in his position on the Board of Burisma, the Republican calls for him to appear would be deafening.\n\nBut then again, too many times we have seen late breaking exculpatory evidence being denied by judges after a trial has started.

The authors' interpretation of the rules is consistent with the usual practice, even if there are some provisions of the Senate rules unique to that forum.  Nevertheless, as others have pointed out the door swings both ways in terms of those the Republicans might wish to subpoena.  Alternatively, the chief justice can duck or punt by blocking a subpoena, pushing the decision back on the Senate.  And what do you think the outcome will be?  Relying on the chief justice to act on principle to alter the course of history by bailing out Republican senators who do not wish to see their head on a pike, well intended though it might be, is mistaken.  The better route is to continue mass pressure on those Republicans who face a real risk of electoral loss by sticking with the gangster boss now ruining their party.",

Thus, absent a filibuster, then the majority vote was sufficient.\n\nThat said, there are arguments that McConnell's resolution was procedurally and facially invalid. The Senate was sitting as a Court of Impeachment, not as the Senate. Under Rule XI, the legislative and executive business of the Senate is suspended. Therefore, there is a question of whether the Senate could amend its rules at the time.\n\nMoreover, the rules changes do not state with specificity which rules they are suspending or amending and were not provided with 1 day's notice. Of course, unanimous consent overcomes this, which I'm sure was asked for by the Chief Justice.\n\nFinally, the resolution was introduced bypassing referral to Senate committee. In such case, they have to \"lie over one day for consideration\" unless there is unanimous consent. If there is just one objection, then the resolution must be placed on the morning business the following day and time for consideration is limited. I don't know if unanimous consent was requested on this particular issue.\n\nIn many cases, at least one democrat should have objected to unanimous consent requests and if they didn't then that's a major failure.",

For years pundits here and elsewhere have said that he is very concerned for the reputation of the Supreme Court, far more than other Republicans seated there. However, some have also noted that although some on the Supreme Court have ideological agendas, he has a political agenda - to help the Republican Party in elections. Some of his decisions, especially the unexpected upholding of the Affordable Care Act, certainly seem to reveal that. I would estimate that he would choose promotion of his Party over the reputation of the court or the good of the nation. But what will Roberts estimate will most help his party in November? McConnell and Trump think it's a fast hokey trial with no witnesses and no evidence subpoenaed. \nYet Roberts might wonder if that would turn some voters off. I do not know how this will play out. Perhaps Roberts will punt - simply ignore the impeachment rules and let McConnell do as Trump pleases. Perhaps not.",

He would have to make judgements on the evidence, and who and what is relevant, and whether the House's case and the President's defense have laid a foundation for calling those witnesses. He would have to decide as to whether Executive Privilege applied to any of those witnesses.   That would land him, and the Supreme Court, into a political thicket that he wants to avoid at all costs. \nChief Justice Roberts sits as a trial judge, and does not rule for the Supreme Court.  If he were to rule on Trump's claim of Executive Privilege for the witnesses that the House managers want to call, it would be subject to appeal, and the full Supreme Court would eventually decide the question.  That is a route that Schiff decided not to take in the first place, as he claimed he needed to rush the Articles of Impeachment through. So what would Schiff's reason be now for having CJ Roberts rule?",

It now imperils the independence of the Supreme Court and threatens its ability to remain separate from politics. If justice Roberts is compelled to rule from the bench on witness subpoenas because the GOP wants to perform a mock trial, we may forever lose credibility in Chief Roberts and SCOTUS as a body fully separated from pedestrian political considerations. \n\nIs it really worth it Mr. McConnell?",

Technically, McConnell's resolution has no authority because the 1868 rules are still in effect. The resolution represents a rule change requiring a two-thirds majority. The resolution didn't pass with one. This was a non-issue in the Clinton impeachment because the rules were adopted unanimously. Democrats can call a point of order and the decision would go to Roberts for judgement.\n\nWhy Democrats haven't sought out Roberts as an intermediary before now remains a mystery. Legal scholars were debating these issues before the trial even started. The general consensus is Democrats have a legitimate recourse in appealing to Roberts. His decision is an open question. However, it appears McConnell has vastly exceeded his authority on the production of documents and witnesses.",

But even if the vulnerable Republicans vote not to hear testimony, Democrats will be armed in their campaigns against them with the Chief Justice\u2019s ruling that the House managers were entitled to subpoena the witnesses.  If the (Republican) Chief Justice believed that witnesses and documents were appropriate, why didn\u2019t the Senators?  Fingers crossed on this one.

The broader public doesn't follow the Court and certainly does not read the opinions.  And thus, through public ignorance, the Court maintains a fig leaf of legitimacy.\n\nRoberts wants to maintain that pseudo-legitimacy; to do so his strategy is to remain in the shadows.  When forced, he will engage in false equivalency and evenhandedly scold both sides.\n\nWould you expect the Chief Justice of the highest court in the land to preside over a kangaroo court?  Well...no of course not.\n\nBut this reckoning has been building for years and as Dana Millbank of the Post so aptly pointed out, no small measure of blame can be lain at the feet of Roberts.\n\nHe has allowed a gutting of the Voting Rights Act.  He has pretended to be helpless in the face of gerrymandering, and he signed on to Citizens United.\n\nThere is more, of course.  Much more.  But those are the highlights.\n\nSo to hope that Roberts will grasp his gavel and  demand justice with righteous rage is wishful thinking.\n\nMany good men and women are doing nothing as Rome burns.",

What I do find interesting is that a Washington Post reporter was suspended for retweeting a link to an article about Bryant's \"nonconsensual\" sexual encounter with a hotel employee many years ago. From what I can tell, the reporter was suspended because she had the bad judgment to tell an uncomfortable truth about Mr. Bryant at a time when many people did not want to hear it. Put bluntly, in the \"post-Weinstein\" era, it's unlikely Bryant could have gotten away with his actions against the hotel employee as easily as he did at the time. But, of course, the reaction to the reporter raises an uncomfortable possibility: perhaps this is not as much a \"post-Weinstein\" era as we like to believe.",

Is Steph Curry only good because of innate talent alone?  Does LeBron only succeed because he is big and strong?  Please.  They work at their craft and are the best because they are master technicians after all the work they invest.
