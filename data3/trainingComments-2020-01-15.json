            "comment_body": "@Betsy Cooper @Betsy Cooper First congratulations and yes, I hope you let us know how it goes! Second: Is it possible you are seeing \"stigma\", where once there was simply traditional acknowledgement that not all pregnancies are viable, as well as a positive preference for privacy -- a time for special bonding with a partner and relying on the intimacy of close friends and family for support before going \"public\"?  I also worry that this \"tell all\" approach reinforces the idea that the foetus is a baby -- with all the moral and legal complications that governments and religions create around that concept.  I had three miscarriages around the three-month mark, before having two children who are now adults. I had the support of my doctor and my sisters and I took a little time to felt sorry for myself and my partner and our hopes -- but I didn't feel the need to grieve, because I did not lose a child. Losing a pregnancy closer to term or, worse, suffering a stillbirth, is an entirely different matter, a traumatic experience and hopefully, because by then \"everyone\" knows, there is an outpouring of compassion for the parents' grief. I do agree with you that there is a lot to be gained by talking to one another truthfully, and sharing our experiences in order to help one another. As a feminist, I believe the personal is political, but our decisions about how to be or not be parents should remain private.",

I signed up for another class when he was 18 months and from that group we formed a book club, Readers and Breeders. We have been together 14 years now. Through pregnancies, divorce, death, weddings, heartache, headaches and also, lots of laughter. We always had an annual retreat weekend, and now that the kids are all teens we've started traveling together once a year for a women's getaway. Unlike my other friends, this group of women is one I probably wouldn't have found or bonded to without my children - and all of our lives are richer because of it. We've even read some books. Congratulations to you! I hope your pregnancy and delivery go smoothly. May you find and form your own parenting support group for all of the ups and downs that parenting brings.

I always thought being pregnant is a happy thing because you are finally able to have children no matter any circumstances. I never would have thought people would be scared to share how far along they are because of losing their job or even their baby. They make up other reasons to get out of things because they don't want to lose the greatness in there lives. This is for people who are ready to share their pregnancies early on  but are too scared of being out down for it. For the women who don\u2019t feel 100% at work and can\u2019t execute it well. I don\u2019t get why people shame women for telling people early on, then they must live a perfect life where they do nothing wrong and everything is fine. I like how this is being covered because I had no clue and I am sure others didn\u2019t either that women are fearful of sharing their life and don\u2019t want to lose their jobs. This story gives great awareness and also advice to women in need on what to do with their lives and bodies during pregnancy. But on the flip side I do get why women wait to tell people because you never know what can happen. I just think women should be able to speak up and say how they are feeling and wait until they are ready to tell everyone.",

Each experienced profound grief, sometimes coupled with traumatic emergency treatment. Such grief does not ease quickly.

Likewise, grief is an extraordinarily private experience, and one not everyone knows how to support gracefully.  While a woman might think they will want everyone to know they miscarried, assuming they will receive a welcome outpouring of support, it is likely they may find more solace in grieving in private than continually comforting others who grieve openly for them.   I dearly hope the author does not learn these painful life lessons herself.\n\nIf the author truly wants to remove stigmas from pregnancy, she could start by not being hypercritical of women who change their eating and drinking habits and other behaviors.

In reality, miscarriage is super common. If we all noticed it happening around us, maybe we could go back to being more matter-of-fact about it, acknowledge the loss without fetishizing and memorializing it, and save women a lot of unnecessary angst.",

She and our son kept her pregnancy a secret until all the tests came back just fine and they felt they 'could tell us'. They had been bursting at the seams with wonder and joy, and yes, fear. They did not tell us because they feared we might not understand if they chose to end the pregnancy, did not want to hurt us by losing a grandchild we were convinced we would never have.\nWe want to know next time. We want to share in that awe and joy and that fear sooner next time. And to help bear the grief if need be. I would not expect them to share with everyone - not their style- but I hope they will share with us.\nThank you for the inspiration to speak openly about choice and love. It will be their choice, and we will love them.",

And once everybody found out that miscarriages are common (something many people don't know until they have one or know someone who did), and that pregnancy is a biological process as much or more than a moral one, we could also chill out about early pregnancy issues and, yes, abortion too.

While you are enthusiastically shouting your pregnancy to all around you, I'd like you to stop and consider that one of the women you are gleefully telling may not be able to have your joy. I was one of those women. Thanks to multiple uterine fibroids that were inoperable, a brush with cervical cancer and endometriosis, I was unable to have children. I have worked hard to work through my emotions about this and luckily, I had a wonderfully understanding doctor and husband who both encouraged me to seek grief counseling. It really helped.\n\nBut when a very good friend announced her pregnancy at work, I found that other women in the office excluded me, to the point where during one conversation, the moms literally surrounded her in a circle and shut me out. It felt like they had slammed me in the stomach with a baseball bat. For weeks, every conversation was pregnancy based. I struggled through it, doing my best to brush off their indifference but it was really tough. My pregnant friend had struggled with infertility so she tried to be sensitive but others were not. Many of them were awkward and didn't know how to react.\n\nSo while I celebrate your good news and wish you all the best, please try to take a minute and be sensitive to those women who have had miscarriages, who have struggled with infertility and DON'T wish to have their private pain on display.",

While I think each woman should certainly feel free to share her pregnancy whenever she's comfortable, and I think it's valuable to discuss the stigma of pregnancy in the workplace, I also think it's quite prudent for most women to wait to \"announce\" their pregnancy until after the first trimester, when the chances of successful pregnancy are higher and the woman is soon going to start looking pregnant.\n\nI also question the entire concept of \"announcing\" one's pregnancy and see it as self-centered in a very modern way. Supporting families, developing reasonable parental leave policies, and making pregnancy less of a workplace stigma are worthy goals. But aside from that, why should the world care that you are pregnant? It's one thing to be personally excited and anticipatory, and another thing to expect the rest of the world to feel the same way.",

To say that it is social convention to not share an early pregnancy is a bit naive.  Often times it is just smart to protect one's job and/or self preservation not having to explain to countless, meaningless people if the pregnancy is miscarried or aborted for genetic problems.  In fact, a Bris is not even performed until the 8th day of a Jewish male's birth due to the commonplace loss of a child even after birth.  Kudos to the author for being excited about being a woman and being pregnant.  I wish her well.  But don't assume people don't share because it is not socially acceptable.  Having counseled numerous women after miscarriage & abortion,  it is a life-changing, traumatic loss that psychically goes to the heart of being a woman. I have yet to find men who announce their low sperm counts. Women, however, have little choice once a pregnancy shows.  It is a matter of CAUTION--not convention.",

The next morning, I overheard him joyously calling his mother with the news and I too was then on the phone with everyone in my family. I empathize greatly with those women struggling with pregnancies and totally get why they choose to hold back. We were just so happy and overcome that we couldn't keep the good news to ourselves.

When they enter the system their first meeting is with a midwife. \n\nThe national register of pregnant women contains information on how each pregnancy ended, and contains complete information from entry into the system until they leave it . A complete record of an individual's contact with the healthcare system is available to the individual herself and to researchers (for example, I can go into my journal at 1177.se and see a record of all visits, record of measurements and diagnoses, and much more).\n\nOnce the child is born, paid parental leave kicks in.\n\nThe contrast between what is reported in this article and what is standard in Sweden is, quite simply, dramatic.\n\nOnly-NeverInSweden.blogspot.com\nCitizen US SE",

None of those pregnancies went seamlessly but my babies were healthy. I had another child who died shortly after birth from undiagnosed birth defects. That tragedy was my easiest pregnancy. I've had an abortion and a miscarriage as well. The experience of pregnancy varies greatly from woman to woman. It's can be wonderful when one dearly wants a baby but can be terrifying under many other circumstances. Read about the experiences in these comments. It's personal. Sharing it is personal.

Most women's bodies bear these stories--the lost pregnancies, the baby that was wanted but never conceived, the babies that died in infancy. I can only imagine what women older than I have been through. Each new pregnancy takes place in a community--or many communities--with all these different stories and histories, as we each march through our years at whatever stage of life we are at.",

I couldn\u2019t tell anyone at work of course, and yet I was miserable throughout that first trimester that was also the first three months of me getting to know my new employer and team. Oh, and did I mention that I sobbed through every doctors appointment? I kept waiting for the news that this pregnancy would miscarry like three previous experiences I had. So thank you for this perspective, and more women should be honest about miscarriage. Every time I meet someone who is sharing their pregnancy news, a little part of me tightens up for them.

Second trimester pregnancies are glowing, ripening, maternal things. First trimester pregnancies still smell a little like... s*x. People will look for ANY reason to make it not okay to talk about them if they are unfortunate to walk around with sexual shame.\n\nThe second is unresolved grief. I myself have had multiple early miscarriages. When friends announced pregnancies I was happy for them. When they announced them at 6 weeks, it burned. It hurt. It was too much to think that a) they might traipse through the early weeks unmolested by tragedy, unlike me, or b) even worse, I might have to watch them also cope with grief while sorting my own out. It took years and two successful pregnancies before I could look at others \"double line\" announcements and not feel the bottom drop out of my stomach. \n\nAll of which to say, by all means, yes. If it suits you, celebrate your 6 week pregnancy. If it suits you, celebrate getting your period on time -- I'd like to see more announcements along those lines, too, just to normalize the whole spectrum of uterine functions. Celebrate menopause. Celebrate good births, hard births, bad births. We talk about our morning coffee more than we talk about pregnancy, periods, and births, and it's time for that to change. Even if it does smell faintly like s*x.",

This time I am keeping silent, although I am feeling very large at 8 weeks and having trouble concealing it. I know my boss cannot legally ask if I am pregnant, so I intend to keep it quiet until I have figured out how I will manage my request for family leave and balance this with the potential promotion. Last time I revealed my pregnancy at work I was immediately pressured to decide my family leave dates, and I wasn't ready. All this is to say that while women who want to should absolutely feel empowered to share, many of us do have reasons for privacy. I agree we should not keep silent only for the sake of social convention, but each person needs to decide what is right for her, and that can vary with circumstances and each pregnancy.",

Only when they have their game plan in place, and it\u2019s clear the pregnancy will likely continue do I encourage them to start selectively sharing the news.

I did practice law, but I don't pretend to be more than an amateur constitutional scholar.\n\nSo, not so fast Mr. Burns!  Your story tugs at my heartstrings, but my better judgment still reminds me that the ERA is still fraught with uncertainty.  There is no doubt that final determination of ERA - as first proposed and submitted by the Congress for ratification by the state legislatures in 1972 - is headed for the Supreme Court.\n\nA majority of the Court can do the right thing and rule in favor of the ERA.  It would appear to be a case of first impression.  But the Court still needs either a legal basis and/or the courage to go against its political indebtedness.  Another, clearer option is to start over in Congress.  The results of the 2020 elections should provide a clue as to that likelihood.\n\nAnd there are still many questions to be asked about its implementation.  Are women ready to assume not only the privileges given to men, but to carry the same burdons and responsibilities?  I hope so.

That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s \u201cA Team\u201d turnover has been 80%: 52 firings or resignations out of 62 positions. He\u2019s left with only \u201cyes men\u201d now. That\u2019s what he likes. As John Kelly predicted, it has gotten him impeached.\n\nSo Esper will now be fired, for failing to corroborate Trump\u2019s lie about 4 American embassies being threatened by Suleimani. A new yes-man will arrive.\n\nIt\u2019s childlike... Many millions of Americans are charmed by it...",

Its how a mob chief operates....they dont want war either...its bad for business....(they are not in the military industrial complex like Cheney was) Look at Trump...his business is hotels, resorts, real estate. Its the only thing he understands and relates to. A War is not going to help him, especially once he is out of office...he will still be in business, and needs those dictators with lots of money, land and beaches. At least not until someone shows him how to make money out of the military. Thats what we need to be afraid of....But I bet thsoe guys have it all sewn up and are not inclined to share....",

In the days after landing on New Georgia Island in 1943, he died saving his comrades from almost certain death.  \n\nHe was part of a 20 man patrol in the jungle which was returning to base late in the day when it was ambushed and pinned down by five Japanese soldiers in a machine gun pit.  After other members of the patrol were killed by the Japanese and the lieutenant ordered the men to withdraw, Pvt. Young, already wounded in the ambush, began creeping forward.  The lieutenant ordered him to come back, but he replied that he could not hear the order due to his hearing loss and continued forward, where he was wounded again.  When he got close enough, he began lobbing grenades into the machine gun pit, causing several enemy casualties.  But, he was hit again while throwing and died from that wound.  His actions are credited with saving many members of the patrol.\n\nAs a Vietnam War Veteran, I believe the choices made by Pvt. Young show heroism, while those made by C.P.O.

Trump is immoral, corrupt and incompetent, as is his circle. Congressional Republicans are to blame because they refuse to hold him accountable. Things will get better once Trump is gone. And that's pretty much the entire framework for debate.\n\nBut the Republicans fail to hold Trump to account because not enough members of the public insist upon it. And that's true because some members of the public are just as corrupt as Trump is, some have become so cynical about elites that they enjoy the spectacle of Trump creating havoc in the corridors of power, some are consumed by lunatic conspiracy theories in which cosmic forces are employing Trump in a process of apocalyptic cleansing and some, more prosaically, are totally indifferent to the fate of the society so long as the stock market keeps rising. As for everyone else, they may form a theoretical majority critical of Trump but are enervated by their inability to agree on a responsive course of action.\n\nThe question is not whether Trump has a coherent and morally defensible Middle East strategy. The question is whether this country has sunk so deeply into the pit of greed, illusion and, increasingly, despair that it will prove incapable of pulling itself out of the tailspin.

The posing with the body, which is a clear violation of US (and international) law -- and has no military purpose -- was improper.  Trump should have left the verdicts as they stood and should not have lionized Gallagher.\n\nHowever, the argument to the effect that \"Now the barbarians we fight will treat our soldiers more harshly,\" is nonsense -- and the same nonsense that has been used to oppose treating captured terrorists with anything but kid gloves.  The barbarians ALREADY treat our soldiers with immense cruelty, limited only by their whim of the day.  The truth is, at the very minimum, we should treat enemy prisoners with no more care than they treat our prisoners; that really would encourage them to treat our prisoners better.  As it is, the enemy knows it can do anything to our prisoners it wants, without consequences.  \n\nConsequences, even the neutralization of terrorists like Soleimani, is predictably mourned by the Left (Ilan Omar and her ilk) or critiqued as to \"timing\" or \"insufficient explanation\" (Friedman and his ilk).",

That code is our moral framework under pressure, and by holding each other to it we keep our unit and our country strong.\u201d\n\nThere are many episodes over the past 20 years that show this to be fantasy... another myth. Not only that, US treatment of military prisoners has broken the Geneva Convention - a standard held by other countries - since Bush-Cheney treated its provisions as a \u201cquaint\u201d anachronism.\n\nAs for Friedman\u2019s comment... \u201cnever assume that people who are in charge are right just because they are in charge\u201d... why would anyone ever assume that anyway? Except that that is exactly what the military does assume and what taking orders means. As one commentator on these pages wrote last week of the Suleimani killing... \u201cwe just have to trust our military.\u201d Why?\n\nIn my experience Americans are much more docile, obedient and complicit in poor leadership decisions -and in authority generally - than the citizens of other democracies. And by the way, this questioning of US authority was one reason why France refused to believe the US\u2019s lies for going to war in Iraq in 2003... and presumably why Friedman wrote at the time, on these pages, that France should be kicked out of the UN Security Council... all for not believing people \u201cjust because they are in charge.\u201d",

But a kill with the bravado that trump needs to exhibit to show his manhood, his power.  Bigger than Bagdaddi and he got away with it.  He pulled the trigger a second time and liked it again, maybe even more.  He's getting the hang of it.\n\nNow he's a marksman, like Gallagher, his Christmas guest.  He gets a high with every shot.  But now, as a cruel bully, he's looking for another target to demonstrate his unquestioned power.  A bigger and more audacious target, just to show he can, just to make sure you recognize his power.\n\nThese are dangerous times, perilous times.  When cruelty and evil take center stage with uncontrolled power, bad things will inevitably happen.  And history again repeats itself.",

But when they killed an American in a rocket attack and also organize the attack on our embassy he did. Suleimani was killed. Did it start a war? The Iranians sent 20 rockets which did minimal damage. No one even got a stubbed toe. The Iranians publicly announced their response was finished and they didn't want a war with us.  They used three additional sources to make sure Trump got the message.  But 53  of their people died and  200 were injured during the funeral by their own people and they shot down an airplane that killed 179 people which initiated large protests against their government. We increased sanctions and now France and Germany are planning to increase sanctions against Iran. Who was right and who was moral.

Learning, understanding and abiding by the law of armed conflict was important to maintain that ethos, and our humanity and stay in connection with the ideals set forth in our founding documents and operationalized by Washington during the revolution. As your readers have pointed out, our military operations have not always been in accordance with the law of war (I fondly remember the intense arguments about this in War College). Unfortunately Bush 2 went down the slippery slope re treatment of prisoners and now Trump openly advocates and commits violations.",

I know people much smarter than me have wrestled with this concept for a couple thousand years so I don\u2019t anticipate a solution in the short term but recognising it and analysing these feeling when they pop into your thought processes would be a step in the right direction. \n\nIn short humans are tribal by nature and this nature can be harnessed for both good and evil.",

The standards of such description were weakened recently and so now the term is not used any more. I think the term needs to be re-invoked and applied for us all to understand that such a person really believes every thing he does in OK. Even though his belief can suddenly change as the mind come upon its next belief so its OK to say or do most anything without a firm set of standards to under score what he is doing.

Winning as quickly as possible always - ALWAYS - involves breaking the resolve of the civilians who support the armed forces. The North victory in our civil war involved Sherman's march through Georgia. The Allied victory in WWII included the firebombing of Dresden where, 20 minutes after the first wave of bombers rained explosives on the city, when the civilians came out on the streets to survey the damage, a second wave of bombers attacked the city...which was not a military target. And after taking 90% casualties in the first hour of the Normandy invasion, as German machine gun emplacements were overrun, no Germans who attempted to surrender survived.\nThe Wehrmacht was incredibly brutal, more than Allied troops, but our side committed numerous violations of the Geneva Convention. \nFinally, wars are won when the losing side is convinced that further engagement is suicidal. The winners are feared. Honor has little to do with it.\nThat said, when a Gallagher is honored, we as a nation suffer as a consequence, but that is true because we are not involved in a full-scale war.

Later, once he had been up close to Wehrmacht conquests of villages in which he saw soldiers shoot men, women, and children, he knew that war crimes had been committed. He had seen several mass murders. He told us that most Germans would not believe such stories; their soldiers could not have committed such atrocities.

In my 64 years, the United States has invaded or bombed a lot of places - usually with no actual moral reason to do so.  \n\nThis type of behaviour continues.  There is little doubt that the Solameini assassination was the result of the influence of a small group within the US government and the necessity by Trump to create a distraction during his impeachment. It was always highly unlikely that this was a result of an apprehended attack, and as the dissembling continues it is almost certainty.  \n\nAmerica needs to learn that it cannot lumber around the world wreaking havoc.  All the families in the world value their members just as much as American families.  Collateral Damage is no less evil than 9/11.  Without the Solemeini killing, 169 Canadians would be alive today and their families would not be grieving.  (It is interesting to note that many of the dead Iranians were students in Canada. If the bigot in Chief was not in charge, many of those people would have been studying in and benefiting the US.)",

The ones who have, usually have some connection to some previous leader (a Ghanaian or a Peron) almost like royalty ascending to the throne. \n\nMany of the female leaders throughout Europe have been elected by coalitions in the ministries, where the populace has not placed them in office, but they have been chosen by representatives (almost like Nancy Pelosi). \n\nIf you look at a number of states in this country you see that they have never elected a woman governor. These states highlight how backward some portions of this country are. We have come along way, but there is still a way to go for women to be treated as the equal to men.",

Sanders denied it in a way that was believable although not terribly inspiring. But in his denial lies the implication that Warren was lying. Still, CNN's follow up question was phrased as 'how did you feel when Sanders said that?' At this point she went into her somewhat inspiring speech about women. But her moment relied on CNN's set up and failure to follow up. CNN's actions implied that Sanders is lying, put no pressure on Warren to counter his denial, and gave her the opening to make her convincing case. \n\nI'm not sure what Democrats are supposed to think about CNN at this point. Remember, it was a CNN debate with Sanders and Clinton when Donna Brazile gave the questions to Hillary Clinton in advance. And now we have this.

The second is whether a candidate is \"electable.\"  The first is a statistical objective fact, but the former says very little about the latter, and is certainly not determinative of it.\nLet's examine the first issue.  This is NOT a debatable point.  A woman candidate will lose a not-insignificant numbers of votes based on the fact that she is a woman, much in the same way as Obama lost votes based on the fact that he was black.  These are cold hard statistical facts; denying them is akin to denying that sexism and racism exist.\nHowever, as the Obama presidency proves, clearly race is not a determinative factor for electability, it just depends on whether the candidate can inspire more voters to show up through his/her message, and yes even through the assistance of his/her race/gender.\nThe lesson to take from the Clinton loss is NOT that a woman candidate is unelectable.  The big difference between Obama and Clinton was that not only could Obama use his race to get out the minority vote, but his message of CHANGE was also an inspiration that energized the Democratic side.  In contrast, sure Clinton lost votes based on sexism, but I'm sure she also attracted votes of additional women because of her gender.  Her problem was she didn't inspire enough people to vote because she never articulated what she actually stood for beyond the status quo.",

Chandrika Kumaratunga was Sri Lanka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President for 11 years as was Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh. Other women whose terms were shorter nonetheless had lasting impact - Golda Meir\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term was only 5 years but her importance cannot be understated. Heads of State have also had long terms - Vigd\u00c3\u00ads Finnbogad\u00c3\u00b3ttir was President of Iceland for 16 years, Mary McAleese Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President for almost 14 years, Tarja Halonen Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President for 12 years. We in Canada have only briefly had a female Prime Minister, Kim Campbell - way back in 1993. Why are North Americans so myopic? This is a fitting time for Americans to elect a woman \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a perfect antidote to the toxic male than now inhabits the Oval Office.",

She dropped out of the first election she entered so technically not a loss.  She was then elected DA twice, the second time unopposed. She then won three senate races.  \nGood record, but lets compare her to Sanders, who wore the brunt of these attacks.  Sure he lost long-shot races in 1972, 1974, and 1976, and again a race for mayor in 1980.  But since then?  He won three mayoral races, lost one Congressional race, but then one it (against an incumbent) two years later, winning a total of 8 races (1991-2007), and then won another two times running for U.S. Senate.  So that's a total of 13 successful campaigns for Sanders vs Klobuchar's relatively paltry 5 (one being unopposed).\nWarren's record is even more limited in comparison, having only had 2 successful campaigns.\nAs such, Sanders' very reasonable response should have been that he has been in continuous elected posts since 1981, with the exception of two years.   I.e. Klobuchar was in university when he first got elected as mayor, and Warren was still a professor.",

Ms. Warren has run for office exactly twice and won.   In Massachusetts, on the heels of Teddy Kennedy's death, she beat an \"incumbent\" who served just shy of 3 years...hardly time to create a lasting impression that might have given a Republican a foothold in a state that had not elected a republican to the Senate since the early 1970s.   That does not hold a candle to the hard fought races the other candidates have faced and, sure, in some cases, lost.   Nor does that non-achievement increase her chances of securing the nomination.  Who will win the nomination, and very possibly the presidency, will be the democrat who comes up with a way to relate to those disenchanted voters out in middle-America who do not care if it's a male or female, as long as that person begins to understand that, even if they're not dirt poor or a minority, they've been unheard for many years.

All of those things work successfully (or at least relatively so, given that there are NO perfect governments) in other Western countries. Why can't we find ways to make them work in the US. As an American living in Norway, I can tell you that the quality of life is significantly better than in the US because of the flexibility that universal health care provides with respect to choosing or changing jobs and the work-life balance that is supported by parental leave policies, options that allow people with disabilities to work part time, and minimum wages that actually allow one to live. Although my taxes are high, they are probably about the same, if not lower than what I would pay in the US if I added health insurance payments to what my US taxes would be on an equivalent amount of income.

She lost and in the following analysis, I realized, she was too timid and afr as she appeared to view Trump as a petulant child unworthy of focus and debate. She lost because she didn't fight. Since then, Warren has also recognized that and has confronted Trump far more forcefully making her a contender. She is a woman who cannot deny not only biology, but the realities of the national public outside the more accepting cosmopolitan cities. Trump terrified Clinton into what appeared as submission. The claims of her better popular vote are an illusion. She should have won in a landslide due to her superiority above Trump. There are voters outside the cities. They are challenged by those who are better educated. They react with scorn as a means of defending their self esteem, and they vote accordingly. Now Warren, a University Professor you and I want to win, is another perceived threat to to many voters. If Warren really wants to win as a woman, she's going to have to fight like a man. That is a fact of life aside from our cosmopolitan idealistic views. It's tough out there. The women have to be tougher. Politics is a spectator sport. Trump knows it and uses it with his in the pocket Television industry. Warren has a gut quality, but Klobuchar is too reserved. So was Clinton. Don't confuse your desires with reality.",

Notice that Sanders denied saying that a woman \"couldn't\" be president. He did not deny saying that a woman could not be elected. A few have already picked up on this distinction, such as Melanie Pryce in this publication. The latter assumption, of course, is pure speculation. Nobody knows who is \"electable\" until they are actually elected. Most people thought Trump had zero chance of being elected in 2016, and indeed, he did lose the popular vote. The female candidate won the election. However, she did not win the Electoral College, as we all know. So again, the entire country is faced with the problem of trying to second-guess how three states will vote. None of those three are known to be hotbeds of feminism. The Democrats in those states tend to be Republican Lites, not Democrats in the FDR sense of the party. So, once again, we are confronted with the fact that the entire country can be controlled by a minority, if that minority wins strategic states. And if that occurs again, you can bet that there will be massive political unrest from the majority, who are sick and tired of being under the thumb of people we profoundly disagree with. This conflict will only grow with time. Electing Warren or Sanders will help to assuage the conflict. Denying the majority again the right to rule itself will only exacerbate the problem.",

Because it runs contrary to everything Sanders has done and said in his life, including his urging Warren to run in 2015. Then, when the issue came up, she used an obviously rehearsed line to garner applause at the debate. And her terrific line, according to that usual purveyor of the most utterly conventional wisdom, Frank Bruni? That she and Klobuchar have won every election they have run, as opposed to the collective losses of the men on stage. Sorry to throw cold water on this little gimmick, but Warren has run for office twice, three times if you count this presidential run. When Bernie Sanders ran and won his first congressional campaign against a Republican, thirty years ago, he had run in several political campaigns and served as a very successful mayor of Burlington. Warren hadn\u2019t yet entered politics and was a registered Republican, as she would be until 1996. It\u2019s easy to have a great record of victories if you run twice as a Democrat in a very blue state. To cap off her shameful treatment of her \u201cfriend\u201d and a truly embarrassing night for the CNN moderators, Warren refused to shake the hand of the man whom she had just smeared. Like Bernie Sanders, in 2015 I was one of the people urging Warren to run. Now? I find her behavior appalling and her cheap exploitation of important gender issues very sad.",

More importantly, we have to keep reminding ourselves that what all the expert commentators are doing during election season is justifying their existence as experts. Essentially they are \u201cexperting,\u201d which is nothing more than educated guessing.\n\nWhat wins election, especially presidential elections, is a candidate and the candidate\u2019s staff who are able to successfully create and manage that candidate\u2019s projection of an image as President of the United States. Think back to how Obama came out of nowhere as a junior Senator to eventually create a sense of inevitability for himself. He wasn\u2019t there until, bit by bit, he became the one. His campaign artfully created in enough voters\u2019 minds that he was the best choice for President. Of course there are thousands of steps along the way in what is a very complex process, but electability isn\u2019t just something a candidate has, it is something a candidate creates.\n\nSo a woman is electable, and to think otherwise is a first step in consigning oneself to the trash bin of history. But that woman, whoever she is, will have to smartly create what will become her own inevitability with a smart campaign that builds a winning image. In fact, that is exactly what Trump did. The job now also involves pointing out all the obvious flaws in the Trump image. Perhaps a woman candidate is the best choice for reminding everyone of the obvious: that the emperor has no clothes.",

I have been waiting for decades to have a woman in the White House, and for months I favored Warren. But lately I have been leaning toward Sanders and Warren's current behavior has pushed me further in that direction. I think she should try to differentiate herself from Sanders without making a villain of him. After all, he is the only other candidate who, as president, would be likely to champion policies that Warren herself favors. I don't know what was said in the Warren/Sanders meeting, but I find it odd that Warren waited until now to bring it up. In any case, Sanders has made it clear that he believes a woman could be President and I am disappointed that after the debate Warren would not shake his hand. In future I hope that Warren and Sanders will not undercut each other as I believe they are the two best candidates in the field.",

Do we really want to harken back to the good old days of the 1960 election that was so blatantly corrupt that even Richard Nixon realized that if he challenged the result the electorate's faith in the system might never recover?  Warren's claim about the men losing 10 elections between them was a perfect example of why I dislike her.  It's too clever, too facile and a meaningless statement that has only a surface appeal.  In fact, all those elections were different and perhaps only show that they ran for offices that weren't sure things.  As Frank correctly points out, it's silly to say a woman can't win just like it's equally silly to say that the men are less likely to win because they've all lost elections in the past.  The amount of time she must have spent crafting that talking point should have spent on any other activity.

I am not saying women cant win. I am saying it is a tricky debate tactic that doesnt actually help me trust Warren. Add to that her point that she was the only one who has beat an incumbent in 30 years which she said because Bernie had beat an incumbent just over 30 years ago. That seemed tricky and sly. I dont like my political leaders tricky and sly.  She never did answer the question about whether Sanders actually said she couldnt win. It doesnt strike me as something he would say considering he was the one trying to get her to run in 2016.",

Most notable among them are white women who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t function without a man, and black men. Both of these groups have a problem with insecurity and feel the need to have a male president. Interestingly, black women, who have every right to feel insecure in this country, had no problem supporting Hillary in vast numbers. \n\nFace it. Some needy people will willingly believe any lie thrown out by the Russians or trump if it will help them justify their refusal to accept a woman as president. \n\nThe only way Democrats can beat trump is with Biden.

But I do admire this swift political jiu jitsu move. If Elizabeth Warren is nominated, such skills will come in handy against Donald Trump.",

Bernie fans will accuse Warren of lying. If Warren edges Sanders out, will they hold their noses and vote for her, or have they learned nothing from 2016? Sanders has a tendency to be so emphatic about his candidacy that he comes across as condescending at times.\n\nWarren did not take the bait to call Sanders a liar - as all the press was hoping - and instead chose to make a larger, stronger point. But not shaking his hand afterwards sends a message too.  Women are expected to defer to men; Warren showed she will not back down when it matters, and that's something she will need going forward - as will any other woman.\n\nMake no mistake. Both of them have an agenda that fits the challenges facing this country better than the centrist dogmas that keep falling short. Of the two I prefer Warren - but any of them are orders of magnitude better than anything on the GOP side.",

She says, \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie\u201d and supports Medicare for All, and takes your money, until someone else, evidently, offers her a better deal.

I don't know how many people out there are really going to believe that. I don't even think the Warren faithful believe that.

Warren's repeated visit to this well is damaging her candidacy.",

Viewing the issue through the eyes of a PA voter, I think nominating Sanders or Warren will result in a Trump victory in the Keystone State. Joe Biden would take the state, as would (I believe) Amy Klobucher . I would love a Biden/Klobucher ticket. I think that's the Trump beater.  Park the identity politics at the curb and keep the real issue out front. ELECTABILITY!",

It has nothing to do with wisdom or kindness. It doesn't reside in a person's gender or character.  It resides solely in money and/or position.   \n\nThere is another kind of power.  The power to influence through one's own being -- by kindness, humor, wisdom and love.  This power can be exhibited by the lowly as well as the high and mighty.  In fact, the hallmark of this kind of power is humility.",

Biden is no debater, but then again I don\u2019t care about debates when there\u2019s a RECORD to review.
