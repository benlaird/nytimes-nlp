An accident last fall messed up my knee and spent some weeks on crutches. These things happened various times in my teens, 20s, 30s: friends and coworkers generally expressed sympathy/empathy for what seemed a routine part of life.  But this time I'm in my 50s: there seemed no end to coworkers' comments on how \"we\" are so much more fragile, weak, slow-to-heal as we age! (A surprise to me, given that those earlier injuries took much longer to heal -- I had no medical insurance back then, so no PT, etc.) \n\nAs a result, my recovery became shaped by its aesthetics. As I progressed past crutches, the doctor recommended a cane or walker. No way I was going to show up at work with a walker. I struggled to find a cane that was comfortable to walk with for long distances yet minimally coded as an \"old lady\" cane. (Those \"old lady\" canes that loop around at the top are da bomb, it turns out. I briefly considered trying to wrap one in indie band stickers.) \n\nThe flip side of whether or not Harvey Weinstein is using an assistive device to appear less capable than he is: the rest of us have to choose between using the assistive devices we may need and looking less capable than we are. That this equating of assistive devices with generalized incapacity in older adults is largely unquestioned seems to me a much bigger problem than Weinstein's court appearance.",

We all make judgments about strangers based on visual cues.

If I am dating, I probably won\u2019t go out with a disabled person because I don\u2019t find them attractive.

Yes, appearances do count.  if Mr. Weinstein looked like George Clooney perhaps there would be no trial at all, but that isn't the point either.  A good deal of commentators are suddenly medical experts deciding what kind of device is needed. Or that Mr. Weinstein is using it simply as a prop. .   Or since he has (or had) so much money he could use a more expensive device (when this one seems to serve it well enough). Some don't even like the color of his suitT.  Nor is that  the point.  I guess one point is all the commentators' presumption of guilt (and theatrics).  I hope the jury is a bit more impartial.  Perhaps, to that point,  the more important point they (and the author) are really making is their distrust of the intelligent decision making ability of juries.  That is always the point. And that Mr. Weinstein still is allowed the presumption of innocence until proven otherwise.  He has a lot of accusers.  So? I can recall a case in France when more than a thousand ignorant men and woman accused a woman of witchcraft.  So they burned her at the stake.  I don't think she had a walker though.",

I think what will get him acquitted is the unfortunate fact that his accusers generally waited a long time to make any accusations, and after the assaults they all sent him friendly texts or emails.  The jury is going to see no evidence at all of actual assaults, no video, emails, or physical evidence, just testimony.  Then they'll see written evidence of the accusers saying nice things to Weinstein after the assaults.\n\nSo I believe that justice will not be done, and Weinstein will be acquitted.

The type he is using is used only by people for whom the greater rolling ability of a rollator would be dangerous because they lack the cognitive or physical ability to control it. If he can walk down stairs, as shown in the photo, he can use a rollator. Here on the Upper West Side, rollators are almost as ubiquitous as strollers. Not an obscure phenomenon. And the slippers?

And using it badly?  Wearing loafers that no PT would tolerate? Not convincing. With a lot of us. it does trigger the opposite reaction, which could be a negative ripple for those who need accommodation.\n\nHis power was that he could control the perception of an individual's talent, aside from literally vetoing or approving hiring. It isn't surprising that he is willing to appropriate cues signaling disability to benefit himself, no matter how this might harm others.  Like Trump, there seems to be zero capacity for empathy, and the arrogance has given way to self pity. Let's assume that he is too repulsive a person to become someone's image of age or disability.",

This article emphasises how easily we fall into a judgemental trap when interfacing and interacting with persons who are experiencing the effects of physical and/or mental disabilities. Today, it is my experience that, for the most part, people with disabilities are not looking for pity. The thought that Weinstein may be simulating weakness, supported by a walker as he moves, in order to garner pity, is a sickening one, and an insult to all disabled persons who bear their struggles with dignity and pride.",

The jury is always the last in and the first out of the courtroom.   When the jury enters, the defendant and all the lawyers are already seated in at their tables.  The moment a recess is called, the jury is led out, while the defendant and all lawyers remain at their tables.  It is possible that jurors might glimpse Weinstein on the street before or after court, but there is never going to be a time that they watch him dodder into the courtroom.",

The consensus (even in one of the Times\u2019s own captions) seemed to be that either Weinstein was a faker, or, if the walker was real, his impairment was a kind of cosmic retribution for bad behavior.\n\nThis kind of coverage reinforces the false notion that a person\u2019s outside mirrors their inside\u2014 i.e., that people with visible disabilities are damaged or unsavory in some essential way.

I challenge Mr. Kristoff to name one government that would perform better.\n\nI read Chinese social media myself.

Kristoff knows China. Instead of his insight into China's unique and unprecedented circumstance -- a population larger than all of Africa combined, with a modern history of political, social and economic development that's a fraction as long as America, facing headwinds of Western hostility, colonial oppression and cultural isolation laden with millennia of feudalism and dynastic rule -- Kristoff retreats to a stiff ideological view that isn't helpful, not in the face of a health emergency.\n\nThere is no precedent for China nor an ideal form of governance that's commensurate with the gargantuan challenges facing 1.2 to 1.6 billion Chinese.  The last time any Western nation attempted such a massive undertaking was British imperial rule of India, which ended in hasty retreat that left a lingering legacy of dysfunction, division and destitution. \n\nArguably the only \"democratically elected\" leader more dangerous and devious than Trump is Modi.\n\nOthers have noted America's glaring public health crises -- opioids, AIDs, measles, obesity, gun violence, racism, tobacco, homelessness, military spending and war.  \n\nWe are a shining glass house on a hill.

A totalitarian communist state is no joking matter.  As for the premise that Xi gets bad information.  He wanted to become a member of the Communist Party so bad that he applied 8 times.  He wants what he's getting in some respects.  And empirically, this has happened before.  Mao starved at least 30 million people to death during the Great Leap Forward.  He confiscated nearly all the grain produced by his agricultural commune system, including seed for the next crop, because cadres kept overestimating the size of the crop to please him.  But he knew the consequences and refused to return surplus grain because he wanted to trade or sell it overseas for military and industrial equipment.  He knew this was happening.  You people who think this is a respectable political party are fools or willful propagandists for communism.  In the 21st century, who in their right mind stands up for this system anymore?

What I can only guess is - when no one understood what this new virus really was at the moment, what one can do is to stop the news becoming a rumor unless we know the magnitude and the impact for sure. Otherwise, causing panic in the public without solid confidence would only make things worse. \n\nWe did see the Chinese government share the genetic profile of the coronavirus, the daily countdown of infection, etc., after they understood the problem better. They shouldn't be praised for doing what they are supposed to do, but it's certainly missing in this article. \n\nOn the contrary to our media, the news organizations here compete to be the FIRST to break the news. Therefore, I think your article is one-sided and partial, as if the outbreak happens in a free country, the situation would be much better. Would it though?",

Chinese people are the ones suffering.\n\nI don't even understand what your argument is. If China had a democratically elected government it would have acted more quickly? Our government has spent the last 10 years denying the existence of climate change, how's that for quick? \n\n\"The government finally ordered a lockdown on Jan. 23 that effectively quarantined people in Wuhan. But by then, according to the mayor, five million people had already fled the city.\"\n\nYou think they should have quarantined Wuhan when there were only 10 cases instead of waiting to see if it was an epidemic? That's making the case for more authoritarianism, not less. You think our government would quarantine New York City? Half the city would need to be infected to make something like that politically palatable.\n\n\"One reason for the early cover-up is that Xi\u2019s China has systematically gutted institutions like journalism...\"\n\nIf there were more journalists (like yourself) in China this whole thing could have been avoided?

Even if Chinese officials somehow missed the implication of SARS in 2002-2003, how could they not recognize what eventually became a common, even stereotypic, scenario for the creation of a deadly virus with the potential for killing millions worldwide?  See, e.g., the Hollywood movie Contagion which made crystal clear the wholly foreseeable risk posed by wet markets.

If this virus really does have such a long--but apparently infectious--incubation period, so many people would be infected before knowing it, spread it around similar to other virus infections (who here can say they always stay home when they are sick?!), and may have recovered without ever knowing they had a coronavirus infection.  They may have just though it was another upper respiratory virus. And since it is possible that many people were actually never sick enough to warrant medical intervention, just coping with their illness with tea and sympathy.  \n\nThe current fatality rate is around 2% which is lower than the 2019 U.S. flu rate of 2.6%.  Not to downplay death but if there are many people with limited symptoms that weren't diagnosed with coronavirus, the fatality rate may actually be lower.  Fast spreading viruses are scary, especially with modern global reach, but let us just practice standard methods for prevention an infection.  Wash your hands frequently and do't go out when you are sick.  But mainly WASH YOUR HANDS!\n\nWe just don't know yet.",

Many knew, and everyone was telling their children to wash their hands and to take caution due to the existence of the unknown virus - and this is in Beijing where there were no reported cases of this unknown virus anyway. Obviously my experiences don't speak to the whole population of China, but I realised if I already knew about it in probably around December 4th to 5th, surely a huge proportion of the population would have heard about it...SARS still is a scarring memory for everyone and when word got out of an ~unknown patient with an unknown virus~ (you get the ghist of what happened). Of course I'd expect the Chinese government did underestimate the scale of it but I do feel this article is heavily critical of Xi and gives a sense that there is no sense of freedom in China, without praising the vast improvement it has made since the disastrous SARS effort, its transparency over the deaths and infections etc. Living in China is completely different than what is written all over in the media.",

More than 50 million people under quarantine?  It's impossible to even imagine, outside of massive fatalities, not simply hundreds. One could more easily make the argument that the Chinese, after a slow start, have been extremely decisive, in a way that would be almost impossible here.  \nThe American political leadership would face the fury of every business group that stood to suffer by a mass shutdown of cities. I suspect the first thing any leadership here would be thinking is: what happens to the stock market if we project fear? What happens to business confidence?  I'm certainly no fan of the Chinese dictatorship, but let's not kid ourselves about the superiority of our system. In the case of another existential threat, the lords of business here have been extraordinarily effective in making sure that we don't combat climate change if it hurts the bottom line.

The key difference between them is that in the latter case, the firing of a corrupt attorney general was consistent with our foreign policy goals, while the former desire to investigate conspiracy theories was solely for the benefit of Donald Trump. How would testimony from Hunter Biden possibly be relevant?\nHaving Biden testify, having Joe Biden talk lovingly of his son would play beautifully into Trump's hands. How could we criticize his family's conflicts of interest if we accept Biden's? Biden has a temper, and I suspect Trump would like nothing better than to goad him by picking on his son. If Biden really cared about his family, he wouldn't be running for President and exposing his son to incessant criticism. If he really cared about his family he would have told his son to stay far away from a corrupt Ukranian company.

There was no doubt a legitimate reason to investigate the facially questionable hiring of the totally unqualified Hunter Biden.  It was engineered  by the notoriously corrupt oligarch behind Burisma weeks after Joe Biden was made \"point man\" on Ukraine.   One year later,  Joe Biden forced out the Ukraine prosecutor who had been investigating Burisma (and by extension Hunter) in the interim after the aforementioned oligarch fled to Russia under a cloud of  corruption allegations.   \n\nSounds like a legitimate area of inquiry for the United States - did the former Vice-President act corruptly to protect his son's interests and, by extension, those of a corrupt oligarch?    \n\nConsider this - Mike Pence's son is hired tomorrow by the Venezuelan state-owned oil company with no relevant experience and young Pence is paid millions  while Vice President Pence is \"point man\" for dealing with Venezuelan dictator Maduro.   Two years hence, President Sanders investigates while Pence plans his 2024 campaign.  A \"corrupt purpose?\"  Hardly.

During the time that the Republicans controlled the House (2010-2019 January), could have started an investigation into Hunter  Biden, but....didn\u2019t! Why? Nothing to investigate. Sure Biden was being pay $50k a month, which is high, but that\u2019s Burisma\u2019s problem. \n\nRepublicans also controlled the Senate, 2014 until today. No, investigation into the Bidens! Suddenly....a Russian oligarch, Dimitri Firtash creates a lie, to help him gain favor from Trump, because he is in legal trouble in the U.S. Trump loves it, now he can sully Joe Biden whom he is afraid of. \n\nThe whole Biden scandal is a lie.

I am certain that if we did a rundown of every adult child of the senators, we would find many more Hunter Bidens - people who have received jobs, speaking fees, etc. that were less about their own merits than about their connections or power.\n\nLet the truth come out, good, bad, and ugly.

Truth be told, the law, at its ugly base, is just a tool for lawyers to try to make it mean what they need it to mean.

Life, meaning and philosophy.\n\nTake the Constitutions words of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\".

Or, can we take it more broadly to serve our current need to rid the nation of a dangerously unqualified president who put his mouth in the Ukrainian cookie jar? We live in the now, not 240 yrs. ago.

But the oligarchs have been bribing the prosecutors to prevent this, and to smear Americans who oppose them (Biden and Yovanovitch).\nTrump and Giuliani are on the side of the corrupt oligarchs, allied with Putin.

If it turns out Bolton has sandbagged the Ds, so be it.\n\n(For that matter, if it takes a Trump v Sanders general election to repair representative democracy, that may be a risk we have to take.)\n\nCall the relevant witnesses. If the political price for that is also calling a witness named Biden whose testimony would arguably be irrelevant in a court proceeding, so be it. We need to engage,  and repair democracy, so pay the political price and let senators and citizens sort out relevancy for themselves. Besides, isn\u2019t it a truism that when people seem to be fighting about one thing they\u2019re often actually concerned about another broader problem? If calling Hunter Biden lets us address deeper issues, that\u2019s not such a bad thing.",

And there's not even any scandal if the ding-dong who hired him because of it never ended up with favors from the elder Biden - the guy just wasted his money.\n\n I know Trump's lawyers have been desperately spinning it to make it seem that way, but Biden hurt the company... he the truth is he didn't help it, his actions were in the open and well publicized and he was following not only official US government policy with his actions, but also the will of the EU... Let Hunter testify if the Republicans want it - don't let that be a lame excuse for not hearing from the people who really matter. \n\nWhat I really find laughable is that Trumps lawyer keep 'threatening' that if the House managers can call witnesses so can they - *what a lovely gift that would be*... please, please, please, please we so much want to hear from all of the presidents witnesses and see just how willing they are to continue lying when they under oath in front of the Senate.....",

How was it debunked if there never was a public investigation during the Obama administration?\n\nIf Hunter testifies it will at least vindicate the extent to which Trump was justified in drawing attention to the corruption in Ukraine and especially involvement of the Bidens in Burisma. A picture is worth a 1000 words. I refer to the picture of Bidens standing with the Burisma officials with golf clubs. Not the same as standing next to some strangers during campaigning. \n\nUnrelated to Biden should just withdraw his filing for nomination of the Democratic party before he gets beaten like a drum and humiliated by other B listers either Bernie or Butti or Bloom.

But, given the forum and Republican prodding, he might very well say a lot of other things that muddy the waters or even come off as unhinged and lacking in credibility; it's not certain his overall testimony would be \"helpful\".\n\nTwo, we have no idea what Hunter Biden would look like on the stand.  It's a stretch to assume he'll come off like a self-effacing, \"aw shucks\" kind of guy, especially given the way Republicans are likely to bait him.  And if Joe Biden is called, he may not come off that sympathetically either; he may be muddled, or he may even lose his temper (he has before).\n\nAnd, there is the argument that letting the Republicans continue to stonewall the idea of witnesses makes them come out looking worse in the end, especially in the likelihood that more damning revelations occur once the trial is over.\n\nI'm not saying that there shouldn't be attempts to get Bolton on the stand, but I'm not sure it should be part of a trade-off for a Biden or two.",

According to a Reuters report which names the Ukrainian govt officials interviewed, Hunter was hired only as a ceremonial figure, to ward off investigations. Only he couldnt ward off the massive investigation into Burisma's owner. Shokin (the Ukanian prosecutor demanded fired by Joe Biden) ordered the owner of Burismas home raided, and is in tape indicating he was going to be interviewing all of Burisma's board members, including Hunter. Upon that development, Hunter called the State Dept, and his father swooped in, strong arming the Ukranians by holding back 1 billion in aid.\nall this testimony will make it very clear that Trump was within his rights to ask the Ukrainian to look into that whole fiasco, even if it is proven the Bidens did nothing wrong.

Bolton was the government official in the best position to know what happened with the Ukrainian call, and he is clearly contradicting what the president has been saying all along.  How in the world could Bolton not be seen as an essential witness?  It's all about the Republicans having sold their soul to Trump.  They have done so because he has proven to be the missing ingredient to their signature objective:  Not the rollback of the Great Society, but the rollback of the New Deal.  The less doctrinaire Senators like Ms. Collins, are terrified of losing their power by pointing out that the emperor has no clothes.  I'd be glad to have Hunter Biden testify - there is zero indication that he did anything inappropriate for Burisma.  So what if didn't have a background in energy - presumably the Ukrainians had that covered.  Bringing on Biden was a way for them to open doors and set the tone that they wanted friendly relationships with powerful people in DC.  Unless and until Hunter Biden does something criminal in return,  it's standard operating procedure.  I'd love to have Hunter Biden testify - all we'll see is a man who has struggled to stay sober, and we'll also see his father as a man who has stood with and fiercely defended him every step of the way.  By contrast, Bolton's testimony will reveal  Trump as a self-serving liar.",

However, it would be very bad for Joe Biden. Perhaps Hunter Biden has already stated that Burisma only hired him because of his last name. This is a half truth. The other half is what his last name did for them and in this case, his last name granted access and influence in The White House. There is simply no other explanation. And that means that Joe Biden had to have the interests of Burisma in mind while he was Vice President.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. I became aware of how the people around Biden seem to benefit from his power. About 15 years ago I read an interview with Joe Biden in, of all things, a car magazine. He was talking about his love of cars and some of the expensive high-performance cars he's driven. This surprised me because I always heard that narrative about how he is a blue collar guy, always takes the train to work, etc. Further in the interview he explained that his brother has the cars he was talking about. 2 seconds with wikipedia and I saw how just about all of his relatives have been extremely successful as lawyers and lobbyists. Through family members, Biden has been cashing in on his power for decades. It would make no sense for so many companies to hire Biden's relatives in various capacities other than the idea that they knew they would get preferential treatment from a powerful senator and VP.",

Any grade schooler can see the Biden aspect is wholly irrelevant, and that point needs to be better and more loudly hammered by the Dems both during this trial and every public appearance. Again, this issue is a messaging problem for the Dems, as they consistently fail to yell and point to parts in need of serious attention.\n\nIf I'm Hunter, I'm right now in serious training with some savvy lawyers for an appearance. If I'm part of candidate Biden advisors, Im in his face about this, and getting him wholly on point about how to counter the Trumplodite lawyers claims, and keep running at Trump. Running right at Trump is what he promised, so do it! During this trial, is the perfect time for him to go on the attack. Go after this absurd Dershowitz defense that Trump is the Sun King! \"I am the State!\"\n\nIts also time for the Bidens to come completely clean. And if they can not, then get out of the race. \n\nIts always a worry the Dems obsession with decorum, that they fail to get in the ring and counter punch with as much energy and determination to win as their opponent. Especially with Trump and his enablers in Congress and Fox faux-News are all WWE, while the Dems fumble with the Queensbury rule book.",

The reason why he was qualified to be on Burisma's board was because he was a Yale trained lawyer and highly trained investment banker.

Biden didn't need to know Ukrainian or anything about natural gas production to do this.  In fact, Burisma must be loaded down with Ukrainian speakers and production engineers.  They needed his particular skills and experience and connections.  His compensation looks fine to me considering what high level investment bankers earn (don't ask).  Further, Biden's later role in China also looks pretty vanilla to me.  He found Chinese investors interested in investing in the United States and else where outside of China.  That was right in his wheelhouse.  Today, Hunder Biden in Vice Chairman of a multi-billion dollar railroad corporation.  His background in the industry?

Dershowitz's  statement reveals it:  \"If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\"  So, Trump is now above the law, he and the Republicans can help smear and slander Biden's name with clandestine investigations by private attorneys and foreign goons, holding up approved aid. Imagine if Obama did this? There should be permanent ramifications for the Republicans as a result of this, but unfortunately that's not the nation we live in.",

Why?  Because opening the witness door logically leads not only to other witnesses, including Mulvaney, and so on, but most important, it points to summoning the central witness in this case.  Who?  President Trump.  Since this is not a criminal proceeding, as the Republicans are so found of emphasizing, Mr. Trump does not have the argument that he can legitimately rely on the Fifth Amendment privilege to decline to testify.  And, if Mr. Trump  invokes the Fifth in a non-criminal proceeding and refuses to answer questions about disputed issues of fact, the permissible political (and legal) inference is that he is hiding his guilt.  The Democrats should try to put Mr. Trump in that box. Indeed, Mr. Trump, with his heightened sense of self, might profess an eagerness to appear.  Yet, in the end, to avoid ever getting to that point, the Republicans, with the support of the Chief Justice, will shut it down and save Mr. Trump from himself.

But unless he has had some recent interaction with Zelenskyy and his circle, his testimony would not link up to the specifics of the impeachment case.\n\nBut since when have we become so fussy about relevancy? The entire Trump defense is irrelevant. That bridge has been crossed.\n\nThe Democrats' reluctance to call Hunter Biden as a witness is surely about Chuck Schumer and the party establishment's desire to protect their preferred candidate, Joe Biden, from political embarrassment. Hunter did nothing illegal. He scrupulously avoided any discussion of Burisma affairs with his father, the then sitting vice president. But he did cash in on selling access to the family name -- perfectly legal but mildly unsavory. And Joe made no effort to stop it. Joe's supporters in the Senate are trying to protect him from having to explain this minor blemish on his record.\n\nThe irony is that Joe has a sympathetic story to tell. His other son, Beau, had just died of brain cancer and he was still grieving the loss. Joe could easily say that he knew the Burisma situation was bad optics but was just too caught up in grief to want to risk a potential family breach by confronting his remaining son. The story would work. It might even be true.",

Republicans surely know this and feigned using Hunter as a potential deterrent against Democrats insisting that Bolton and others testify, yet vehemently refusing Hunter to be a witness. If the Democrats were to agree, I am sure the Republicans would vote against any witnesses, or change their tune an call for the whistleblower to testify. Actually, if no witnesses are called and Trump is  vindicated, the Democrats have ample ammunition to continually expose the Republican sham trial for the rest of the election year. An effective weapon as the latest poll shows 75% of the electorate, including 49% Republican voters, favor having witnesses called. And one must not forget that the rabbit is out of the hole and Bolton's book will be published before elections.",

Careful historians have found the opposite: decades of offers by the Palestinians and Arab states to which Israel always said no. Far from being ready to take less, the Israelis have always been maximalists. \n\nSince Israel took the West Bank in 1967, it has sunk billions of dollars into settlement construction to ensure it would never have to give the territory back. Since the first intifada, this plan was simply adapted to provide the Palestinians an autonomy zone - read, Bantustan. This is what Trump has endorsed: an openly apartheid arrangement, where one ethnic group surrounds and dominates another that is disarmed  and rendered helpless to resist. It lays Israel's fundamental racism bare (and Trump's). \n\nThe good part of this apartheid \"plan\" is that the situation is now too obvious to ignore. The only solution is the South Africa solution: one state for all its residents. It's been the only solution for a long time, but people didn't want to admit it. Maybe now, with a different goal (unification) and the real problem (racism) made plain, negotiations can start that are not based on myths and the other pointless, distracting hooey this article promotes",

The division of Palestine along the lines suggested only officiates the illegal division that has taken place up to this time. No one who understands the conflict will be convinced that Israel will respect any national boundaries; they have not for the last 70 years. That Saudi Arabia and the UAE support this measure isn't shocking; the two feudal-capitalist states are as much dependent on American imperialism as Israel.

This is like how the US treated the Native American tribes in the 1800's or the Allied powers treated the Axis powers after WWI. We know how well that went.",

It is not a two state solution but apartheid. A legal cover for occupation.\nThe traditional zionist claim to be interested in a fair compromise and a settlement leading to peace and harmony has become threadbare to the point of transparency. \nIt is now clear that Israel itself is a threat to peace and cannot be allowed to continue to exist in anything like its present form.\nIf the international community does nothing when Israel once again illegally annexes occupied territory then it has learnt nothing from the mistakes made in the 20th century.",

When the great and victorious nations created the Jewish State, an accommodation for the Palestinian peoples should have been considered as part of that process.  The argument that there was not a Palestinian homeland belies the fact that neither was there a Jewish homeland of recent vintage.  The \"Palestinian problem\" which ensued was totally predictable and the cost was in Israeli and Palestinian lives.  This so-called Peace Plan exacerbates the situation as it, once again, ignores Palestinian interests and imposes a solution that can only succeed through an honest negotiation between stakeholders.  If you were to argue that the Palestinians at this time are not ready to negotiate, your point would be more valid. Imposing a settlement ensures continued violence.  In my opinion, your analysis is simplistic, naive, or both.  The end result would create additional dangers for both Israel and the Palestinians.",

Naturally they present it as a \"fait accompli\". However there is no reason for anyone - especially Mr Stephens - to accept it at face value! What is needed from the Palestinian side is a serious counter-offer. Here is my proposal: a return to the 1948 borders and reparations of 1 trillion USD to be paid by the US and Israel to the new Palestinian state, justified by the damage to the Palestinian economy caused by the illegal Israeli occupation during the past 50 years. Also it is obvious that the US has forfeited its role as \"honest broker\" in any peace talks and should not seek to re-assume such a position going forward. If Israel insists on US participation the Palestinians should be allowed to pick their own partners to join the talks (I would recommend the Iranians.)",

To Palestinians, it's another example of their impotence in the face of those who tell how how they should live, without them really having a say. They feel like they are settling for scraps; moreover, everyone else is saying they should be grateful for the little they are getting. \n\nThe competence (or lack of it) of their government isn't at issue here. They could have the most competent government in the world and still be forced to settle for scraps because they have no economic or military power (so no political power), and the system is expressly designed to prevent them from getting either. Until the Palestinians are truly equal partners in the peace process (which means they need a powerful patron - because they don't have political power), they won't stop acting in a way you would deem as harmful to their own interests.",

That dismissal of the proposal as nothing more than domestic politics is followed by second line of derisive attack under the subheading \"A Proposal With Israel Upends Decades of Diplomacy.\"  \n \nDecades of diplomacy, indeed. With what result?  No peace but continuing violent attacks on Israel, no solutions, nothing from Palestinian leadership but rejection, and pre-Trump U. S. pressure on Israel to make concessions which served only to fuel the demand for more concessions.  \n\nThe latest peace proposal will go nowhere because Palestinian leadership, true to past behavior, has already rejected it out of hand. Unfortunately that leadership will look to the Times's coverage of the proposal as validation for the rejection rather than reading the Bret Stephens column and finding in it the common sense that ought to guide Palestinian leadership to the benefit of everyone, not least the Palestinian people.",

The whole area would benefit if some divine interference relegated it all to insignificance, and the rest of the world left them all alone to work out their differences... of course, that's not going to happen. And Trump's 'plan' is only the latest evidence, and certainly no solution.",

Of course, white European settlers have always been fine with stealing everything from indigenous people, shunting them onto reservations, and then blaming them for failing to accept the injustices heaped upon them. Maybe that is the takeaway here. The fact that people who were once victims can become victimizers is hardly surprising or new. What is rather disgusting, however, is the effort to rationalize such injustices through an argument that amounts to no more than \"the powerful will do what they want and the weak suffer what they must.\" That is an argument that doesn't accord very well with Israel's self-serving presentation of itself as a victim, a status that justifies its injustices against the Palestinians.",

At this point, the Palestinians are too weak militarily and economically to counter Israeli power, bolstered as it by American support.  Little by little, the Israelis are seizing control of the entire territory.  If they do, however, in the long run they could be defeated demographically \u2013 but only if enough Palestinians were to stick around-- and then the Jewish homeland would become a pluralistic democracy with a Jewish minority.    It would take a long time. Palestinian refusal to take the bait and to walk away from this puppet state deal might induce the Israelis to take unilateral action \u2013 annexation would give them what they do and don\u2019t want \u2013 the land, but with a large number of new non-Jewish Israeli citizens.    An alternative would be a just solution brokered by an honest broker \u2013 obviously not the U.S. at this point or likely ever.",

No, for them the issue is the impossibility of allowing anyone other than a Muslim to rule lands their forbears had once conquered.

Other countries decided unilaterally to allow mass immigration from Europe into the Palestinian territory. Some deal. They fought this unwanted invasion...and lost their homes. Some deal.

That THEY were promised. They were stubborn, rash, despairing, savage at times, poorly led, and behaved in the manner of a conquered people trying to hold onto what was once theirs. They reacted, resisted and refused just as Native American tribes did to being overrun by the onslaught of white settlers hungry for their land.

Sacramento, which they had previously considered their capital, would now also be annexed by this foreign government. And California would now no longer have control over their defenses or air spaces. How appealing would this be to Californians? And mutatis mutandis, how would residents of the other 49 states feel with a similar swap in their states?\n\nToday, the Israeli Knesset debated annexation of the West Bank, that is, implementation of a key part of the Trump proposal, leading me to ask how an agreement can be approved by only one side of the deal.

Under the proposal the Palestinian's allotted portion of West Bank looks like stepped-upon slice of Swiss cheese. Now look at the areas they received as compensation along the Egyptian border. They are not only  desolate, arid and stony  desert, but isolate and unconnected islands, totally unsuited for sustainable food production. Their water rights to the Jordan, what little is left, is at risk as well with a burgeoning Israeli settler population. To this and other depravations of basic human rights of freedom and self determination they should just say YES! This is equivalent to sending old Eskimos adrift on ice floes. They will loose their precious lands either way; why give Netanyahu and Trump the accolade of peacemakers with the expectation of winning an utterly undeserving Peace prize?

Because the current conditions in the West Bank, those created by the 1993 Oslo Accord that people niavely believed would bring about Palestinian statehood, has made independence untenable.  Every expert on the conflict knows this, but I guess Jared Kushner hasn't read those books.\n\nAsking Palestinians to cheer the prospect of living in small impoverished bantustans so that Israelis can live in resource rich settlements in Judea and Samaria is asking Palestinians to suspend reason. Then again, peace plan after peace plan has failed to see Palestinians has humans entitled to self-determination, basic human dignity, and full sovereignty.  This plan like others treats them like animals to be contained by militarized encirclements and importantly redraws the internationally recognized greenline from 1967.

The Romans thought up and executed the Diaspora in the first century C.E.  In the third century, the Catholic Church became pretty much officially anti-Semitic.  Then, as Rome pulled back, the land became the new home of another people being squeezed out of their home.  The Byzantine Empire takes control of the area, to be followed by the Arab conquest of the land.  Then Crusades, where a Crusader (Raymond d\u2019Aguiliers) reported the fact that \u201cthe streets of Jerusalem ran red with the blood of unbelievers.\u201d\ufffc\n\nBut the Crusaders could not hold onto the land and following the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, the land was taken over by the Muslim Ottoman Empire, where it remained until after WWI, when the British took control of it.  During WWI, in order to get more Jewish people onboard, the Balfour Declaration officially put Britain in favor of Zionism (the idea that there should be a Jewish State in the area).  So Britain helped Jewish people resettle in the area, but still no state of Israel.  Israel came about because Truman needed the majority of Jewish votes behind him, and championed the founding of Israel.\n\nWhen Israel was founded, the Palestinians, the larger population, were given the smaller, less viable portion of land.

It snagged some real estate that had been the homeland of the abused sect 1500 years previous and turned out the current residents (who were conveniently Arab and Muslim). Then it used its outsized military power to put down every effort of the modern residents of the area to asset any control over their own lives.\n\n In essence, we have recreated the Jewish ghettos of Europe. Only now they are in the Middle East and are occupied by Palestinians. \n\nI wonder if every homeowner, farmer, rancher and business man in the United States would be willing to hand over the keys to their property to the descendants of the Native Americans who occupied that land only 400 (not 1500) years ago.\n\nPalestinians are just as equal as Jews and Christians.

The Palestinians lived on this land for over a thousand years and outnumbered Jews for most of that period.

The 1917 Balfour declaration before the war was officially over officially signaled the Brits intentions to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine which had more Arabs than Jews at the time. This arose due to pressure from high ranking Jewish members in the British government. The Palestinians had no say. This lead to the Zionist return of Jews to Palestine over 1917-1948 and the establishment of Israel in 1948.\n\nIsrael has had the strong financial support of the US since then, while the Palestinians have had no real patron, other than Russia and its allies as a pawn in the proxy conflict with the US.\n\nThe question is what is just for the Palestinians here ? What would WE have done if someone had tried to carve up America leaving us little to nothing ? Concede? No. We fought a war of independence over it.",

Arab Muslims now slightly outnumber Jews in the southern Levant, and if they become a large majority it will be more difficult for Israel to deport them or \"cut the grass\" more closely. I know it will be difficult for the Palestinians to just abide in place. But they should realize that the capons leading the EU will never come riding to the rescue them. Their only hope is to remain in place until they greatly outnumber the Jews. They are now the Jew's responsibility. They must make the cost of Jewish ownership as high as possible.",

I agree with Bret Stephens that Palestinians completely botched their chances of a better deal on numerous occasions.  However, that does not justify the wholesale annexation of massive portions of the West Bank, including the entire Jordan River Valley.  Unfortunately I do not see a deal on offer Palestine will accept, nor do I see Palestine prepared to make the necessary concessions either.  When an unstoppable force meets an unmovable object you reach disaster.  \n\nIsrael will not surrender its settlements and frankly who can blame them?  They've offered peace deals on several occasions, and Palestine has rebuffed them at every turn.  The Arab States called for the genocide of the Jewish people, and nearly succeeded twice.  \n\nPalestine will not accept a rump state, dependent on Israeli (and Arab) generosity with no control over its own destiny, and who can blame them?  Millions of Jews showed up in the 1940s, suffering from a catastrophe the Arabs had zero hand in.  Their colonial occupiers demanded concessions, and they've been fighting ever since.  Their Arab allies promised them all of Israel, and they've been trapped on the West Bank, and Gaza, ever since.  \n\nIt's a crap situation.  I would suggest Israel offer a sweeter deal to bring Palestine to the table, but better offers were offered in the past only to face rejection.  Why would Israel offer more if they know it wont be accepted anyway?",

The only question was and is what to do with them and their rapidly growing population. It has been apparent for years that they would never have their own nation on land coveted by the Zionists nor would they ever be citizens of what is now officially a Jewish nation. Sending them off to live in the desert is the plan now. The grand illusion of the Trump / Kushner plan is that some of them will continue to live in pockets in the West Bank in a sort of illusory nation without sovereignty or self-rule, officially dependent on Israel\u2019s assessment that it is subservient enough to be tolerated. And the tunnel? What silliness. It\u2019s not a deal that any of us would accept, particularly since it is being offered by a man who has always been willing to renege on even a bad deal if it could be changed to make it worse and has always been happy to pay less than he promised.\n\nMaybe they will end up being treated like our Native Americans, romanticized by some but having only a sliver of what once was theirs, although I doubt they will ever be thought of as being the Native Israelis. Or maybe they will just be lost from our memories, a stateless people who just fade away.",

What they have smacked into here are two powerful negotiators with strong positions who dismiss pocketing as the ploy it is. Instead, the offer looks at the situation as it is --  with Hezbollah in Lebanon, an unstable Syria, Iran clamoring for its destruction, a dictatorship in Egypt, and a Palestinian people split between the kleptocratic government of the West Bank and the Islamist terrorists of Gaza. The last thing Israel wants in a new Palestinian state is another repressive problem. The PA would be advised to accept this offer and negotiate, because waiting another 25 years is unlikely to yield a better result.",

Most of the population was Muslim, but there were a few Jews and Christians. There had been some problems, so the UK suggested a compromise between the three ethnic groups.  Apparently the Muslims were adamantly against compromise, even though they had a huge demographic advantage. So the UK kicked the can down the road. To say the least, it had other more urgent international and economic problems to address.  By 1947 the demographics of the region had changed dramatically.\nAgain, this is just what I have read. I would welcome more insight on this.",

Joint Arab-Jewish enterprise zones, social entrepreneurship, construction vertically of multi-tiered highways, large-scale irrigation projects, medical and scientific development, and as-yet-unimaginable ventures in cooperation can yield untold blessings. But a much farther-reaching paradigm shift is the recognition that Arabs and Jews share sibling cultures and languages going back to our very origins. The Arabic \"Nahnu ihwan\" (we are brothers) is fully cognate with the Hebrew \"Anahnu ahim.\" The reconciliations in the Book of Genesis of Ishmael and Isaac and Esau and Jacob have enormous symbolic meaning for the present adversaries. I consider the similarity of the Hebrew roots of the words \"aravim\" (Arabs) and \"ivrim\" (Hebrews) to indicate a closer interconnected- ness of the peoples millenia ago than has been hitherto recognized. Bret Stephens, I believe, has the cogent optimistic long-term outlook which should command more attention.",

As previous comments argue, and I tend to agree, that the Israeli administration (and now the American administration) cannot be trusted. As such, saying 'Yes' does not lead to peace. Rather, it simply sets the baseline for how much they are willing to give up and by saying 'No', they know what they have.\n\nSo, is Stephens arguing...say 'Yes', you lose; and if you say 'No,' you lose too?

But, if you want the Palestinians to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, you can\u2019t in good faith deny them the same exact right, one that was forcibly taken from them in 1948. You also can\u2019t deny them human rights and keep your foot on their throats, as one commenter here so aptly put it. Who here wouldn\u2019t reject such a condition?",

Israel accepted partition in 1948, but 5 Arab armies attacked.  Israel fought a defensive war in 1967 and gained the West Bank and Gaza, which had been controlled by Egypt and Jordan, not Palestinians.  Afterwards, the Arabs famously issued the 3 nos at Khartoum, including no negotiations and no peace.  The Arabs attacked again in 1973.  The Palestinians rejected 3 offers of  peace which were far better than Trump's plan.  Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, but after Hamas took over, they responded with rockets instead of showing they wanted to live in peace.  More recently, Palestinians refused to negotiate, even when Israel froze settlements for 9 months and released thousands of prisoners. The rejection of peace offers and resulting intifadas convinced Israelis that Hamas and a majority of Palestinians still want to destroy Israel. Thus, Israelis are convinced that Palestinians' idea of a two state solution is to get whatever they can now and continue to fight.  The 1967 borders are indefensible, if Hamas, aided by Iran, takes over.  Stephens is right.",

The state of Israel was created in response to a refugee problem (following WWII) but was done so by looking back some 1900 years. The current problem of settler incursions continues that tradition. I agree that the state of Israel is not going to go away, that it is in many respects a shining star in the Middle East, and that the Palestinians are not well served by their \u2018leaders\u2019. This is much the same situation that the current countries of the Americas created during their foundational periods. We claimed all of the land save small slivers we considered worthless, said we were doing God\u2019s work and that the original occupants had no legitimate claims, and relegated native Americans to these unsustainable outposts, which we then made even smaller. When they resisted, we fought them, each time they resisted their condition worsened. Eventually it was all settled to the benefit of the existing Euro-centric countries, and to the continuing detriment of the original inhabitants. To tell the Palestinians that this is a 21st century solution for this ongoing conflict is laughable, even if no one can come up with anything better. This is particularly true with respect to the \u2018settlers\u2019 who have nibbled away at what little the Palestinians have managed to hold on to.

Hardly anyone in Germany today would serioisly speak of let alone seek return. That is reality. \n\nIs recognzing reality what Mr. Stephens is calling for? One commenter thinks so and summarizes Stephens' column: \"This is the law of the jungle - but sometimes that\u2019s all there is.  As Stephens points out, there is absolutely no reason to believe there\u2019s anything better to be had.  Time to end this pointless conflict.'\"",

He turned to violence rather that turn the page to nation building and reconciliation.\n\nIsrael\u2019s dilemma is that it faces a perpetual existential crises undergirded by the belief that the Palestinian goal is not a two state solution, but a two-stage solution: stage one the creation of a Palestinian state and a stage two the ability of that state to grow strong enough to absorb Israel into it.  \n\nThe least likely outcome of the Trump plan is that the Palestinians accept a deal that gives them none of their core demands. More likely is either Palestinians returning to violence to attempt to extract better terms and/or demanding full citizenship within the singular nation of Israel and Palestine, which will challenge Israel\u2019s ability to remain a democratic Jewish state.  Israel may ultimately have to choose between becoming England ruling Ireland with the Sean Finn becoming the PLO or finding a way to create a better version of Lebanon with one democratic nation providing equal rights to two peoples.",

The Palestinians and the surrounding Arab states would be far better off today, economically and otherwise, had they made the hard decision in the 1940s to work with Israel instead of trying to destroy her.  Israel's remarkable success in building a vibrant economy in its part of a region that had known only poverty for centuries could have stimulated growth throughout the Middle East, had cooperation replaced hostility and endemic conflict.\n\nThat alternate reality highlights one feature of the proposed plan that must play a central role in relations between the Palestinian state and Israel, if the region is to experience peace.  The $50 billion of economic assistance must form part of a comprehensive program of aid and technical help that could gradually lift the Palestinian people out of poverty.   The Palestinian authorities would have to cooperate in this venture, but only Israel has the resources and expertise to provide the leadership.\n\nPalestinians and Israelis do not have to like one another, but economic cooperation would give both countries a practical reason to suppress their mutual antagonism in exchange for a higher standard of living.  The current Palestinian leadership might  reject such a partnership, but their people might have a very different response.",

(Time Magazine, (\"Next Generation Leaders\", May 27, 2019, page 48)\n    That is another example of \"The War on Science\".  We see an uptick in the number of children getting Measles, which is not totally harmless.\n  Ethan went on the Web and did his OWN research & saw the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed NO link between Vaccines and Autism.  Ethan got vaccinated in early 2019, at age 18.\n\n   Ethan's own parents, especially his Mother, still do not agree with his decision.  But he never questioned her as a Parent.  He said: \"I question her sources.  Misinformed people are not evil, but misinformation till isn't OK\".\n\n    The most egregious example of the War on Science, is Climate Change Denial.  \n     Oceanic Acidification, lowering the Ph of the Oceans from 8.1 to a projected 7.85, makes the Oceans more Acidic, threatening we eat, like Clams.  Soon, there may only be Jellyfish in the Ocean.  They tell me Jellyfish are tasty on a Cracker, but I am in no rush to try that.\n\n     Oceanic Oxygen Depletion also threatens us, as a Nov 2015 article in \"The Bulletin of Mathematical Biology\" pointed out.  The warmer ocean threatens Plankton that makes 66%+ of our Oxygen.  Normally, air is 78% Nitrogen & 21% Oxygen. Neither gas traps heat.  But just a small amount of CO2 and Methane DO. \n(<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/if-carbon-dioxide-makes-u\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/if-carbon-dioxide-makes-u</a>/)",

China will shovel not the just the grounds to build its infrastructure of hospitals for isolation and treatment but will shovel billions to combat the Corona virus.

I am referring to the potent broad spectrum antivirals against enveloped viruses from pomegranates that I have with my own hands shown to be potentially capable of giving any person exposed to the deadly enveloped virus like the WCV to have a fighting chance to mount an effective immune response to clear the virus. \n\nWith the signing of big bipartisan trade deals in recent days, the commerce secretary has hardly flunked any test.

Once such a virus appears to any extent in the US, disruption will be magnified, because people will decrease shopping, decrease face-to-face business, and if they are caring for anyone with a fever, they will need to put themselves on quarantine.  With the SARS threat, in the context of specialty medical care, we planned to eliminate all but strictly necessary office practice care, to limit hospitalizations to urgent/emergency only, and to protect the health of our physician and nurse staff by limiting overall contact with the public.  You do not know who is incubating a virus, so you limit potential exposure.  Obviously, you wash hands as normal practice, but in an epidemic situation, you wash even more.  Conventional face masks are of limited utility to prevent infection, so you need the inconvenient HEPA mask, but that still does not fully prevent transmission by droplet into the eyes.  So, the cost of coronavirus in the US will be profound, a disruption of normal activity, time and cost for re-education, certainly disruption of elective healthcare.",

A fever and a cough will not select out people with the right health care coverage, it can find its way to someone without insurance , underinsured or just visiting America. \n\nAmerican hospital emergency rooms can easily be overwhelmed by the worried well and fearful of having had contact with someone known to have been infected. Intensive care units can filled rapidly placing hospital resources under severe strain. In short Ross does not understand the economics of health care and does not understand why an emergency health insurance system needs to be organized and yes...funded.  It is clear that America is not prepared economically for the effects of a pandemic on our medicals system. It is also clear that our medical system is putting us in as much danger as the coronavirus itself!",

Rather than just complain about Trump,  if you are not already doing so, get out of your comfort zone and work to change who is leading our government at both the state and federal level.   This means door to door canvassing, making phone calls and talking to friends as if your life depends on it  - - because it may.  If not for you, for future generations.  Don\u2019t ignore state government.  State house and senate races are often a good place to start if you have never worked on a campaign before.  You might like it and even make a few new friends.   We are already canvassing in Kansas despite snow and low temperatures.\n\nIf you live in a blue state and have no one to work against, consider helping out good candidates in red states by sending a small donation.   For example, the Democrats in Kansas have a great candidate in Barbara Bollier for US Senate.  We have no choice, we must take the Senate back to stop the damage on the Supreme Court.\n\nWe must use this anger in a productive way to get things done.",

Over the past few years, the party has become divided between inclusively-minded liberals and exclusively-minded progressives.\n\nDemocrats have long been a diverse group, but that only means there will be competing agendas among people living in a state of comity. So it was as recently as four years ago. Since then, however, progressive opinion has put out spikes of antagonism toward entire biological sets of people: males, whites, elders. Jews, who are a race-equivalent Other in many minds.\n\nThis is something apart from, and apparently heedless of, electoral politics. It's a network of attitudes that serves to channel everyday progressive discourse, not least in the Op-Eds and the comments sections of The New York Times. Among today's archetypal progressives, political engagement has become war on biological class enemies.\n\nAmerica's liberal party, of which I'm a liberal member with progressive tastes in policy, was a long time coming to this (<a href=\"http://thefamilyproperty.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://thefamilyproperty.blogspot.com</a>/). Now an election season poses a couple of awkward questions:\n\nWill those on the left who have blown up the very idea of commonality find it possible to make common cause with Americans who belong to any of the scorned categories above? And will those Americans find it possible to set aside so much that they've been hearing and reading?",

I agree about the end desirable, \"weaving.\"  This is what some of us saw in politics earlier in our lifetimes.  No, it wasn't some uptopian state.  But it was based on compromise, which is a type of weaving.  The voters expected this.\n\nCurrently, in Congress we have a situation where the right (McConnell et. al.) refuses to cooperate and worse.  The solution currently is not for the left to reach across the aisle.  This is like an unhealthy or even abusive relationship if one side tries to compromise but only appeases a bully.  In any healthy relationship, there is give and take.  The question then becomes: how do we get to that place? This could be a focus rather than a stalemate or worse.  \n\nFocusing efforts on voting out those who are unwilling to ever cooperate is one answer, culture change is another.  Legislation would be another (term limits, etc.).  Right now we have attempted containment by the Dems, impeachment, for instance.  This essay is an attempt at culture change and I applaud that.

Whether it's individual vs. individual or group vs. group, the common problem here is that all our present systems are designed strictly for competition, when we should be cooperating.  Why can't we all just get along?\n\nThe day-to-day headlines may look scary, but the fact that we're in a time of great change means that we now have the opportunity to redesign our economic and political systems. \nAs technology advances, it increases the benefits of cooperation, and decreases the (supposed) benefits of competition. Technology can also help cure the material scarcity that traps us into needlessly competitive and counterproductive bickering. \nRather than fight over incremental changes to our current system, shouldn't we be trying to design new systems to foster cooperation rather than competition?  \n\nSo, what would that look like?

This documentary is made up of interviews of leading social analysts, including Robert Reich,  David Axelrod,  Ben Rhodes, Steve Schmidt, Frank Luntz, Steve Bannon, and others.  Their dialog very much addresses the power of social interaction types - altruism, cooperation, spite, and selfishness.  And how this typing along with incitement politics impacts social and voting behavior.  \nWhat struck me is that these experts were also struggling for answers to social media,  often expressing their concerns in terms of fear and horror (Frank Lutz was in tears).  \n\nIt gives me some comfort that powerful voices recognize the problem and are also working toward solutions - basically, leadership based on truth and compassion - something algorithms cannot do (an algorithm's Achilles' Heel). \nYou can see the individual interviews (which I recommend) on YouTube, to get the complete perspectives of these experts.   For me, if we want to overcome the power of spite and selfishness in politics, media, and social networks, it will be a matter of focused hard work and truthful, strong leadership to drive positive social change - with an emphasis on hard work.  This all can be done with our current generation of technology.  It is a matter of putting people first.",

It is often called the Typing of Social Interactions - leveraging Altruism, Cooperation, Spite, and Selfishness (areas all brought up in Davids article). \n\nOn any social media platform, there are hundreds of algorithms determining your social interaction interests and uses this information to then \"help\" you find groups of similar interests - your own tribes.   A major reason I left Silicon Valley was that the powers of incitement politics (Trump, Fox, Beck, Limbaugh, etc.) typically drove people to spiteful and selfish relationships and the sites that support these views on a variety of platforms, basically leaving altruism and cooperation in the dust.

He flies a Confederate battle flag (even though we live in Pennsylvania), and he loves to talk about how Trump will get rid of \"those people\" (immigrants, Muslims, LGBTQ--take your pick).  He sneers at Democrats like me.\n\nThe Republican party wants to WIPE OUT the Democrats.  They want a permanent, white nationalist minority government.  And they ain't budging an inch from their position.  Ever since Reagan, the Republicans have been criticizing the Democrats for \"not meeting us in the center.\"  The problem is that, for the past 40 years, the Republicans have been moving further and further to the right, while dragging \"the center\" with them.  Nowadays, anything to the left of \"tax cuts for the rich\" and \"let's get rid of all these Mexicans\" is considered raging, bomb-throwing Communism.\n\nIf Republicans want to \"work with\" the Democrats, then they have to start moving to the LEFT.  And that means denouncing the KKK, the neo-Nazis, and all the other alt-right thugs.  It also means overturning Citizens United and kicking corporate \"dark money\" out of politics.  Otherwise, this Democrat ain't moving to the right.\n\nThe Republicans need to STOP being Trump's flying monkeys.  I don't see that happening anytime soon, so I see no reason to move ONE INCH from my liberal positions.  As far as I am concerned, the GOP are the existential danger here.",

And I'd argue it's because those with power have in the past, are now and (sadly) will in the future act in a way where selfishness reigns supreme.  Democracy was supposed to distribute that power to all the people so that there would be competition among all our various interests that would end up, eventually, serving all of us to some reasonably fair degree.  The problem is that the competition has never really been fair and those who have the power just keep wanting more.  Easy proofs of this are the obscene inequality in wealth, lawmakers who are in the pocket of special interests, a court system where the powerful not the disempowered are catered to....\n\nSorry, but I think that these disparities are baked into the system at this point and that Brooks' solution of tinkering around the edges with programs, institutions and policies isn't going to change that dynamic.\n\nWhether a revolution will make the situation better or worse is irrelevant as given the fear and anger which are so prevalent, a revolution seems inevitable.",

That is nothing compared to the hundreds of millions of years that many others have lasted, and we have every reason to doubt that we can ever last anywhere near that long. Have we had an outsize effect on the whole earth and on all other species? Yes, but is that a sign of long-term success? It could be argued that what we're seeing is in fact hard evidence for the likely long-term failure of the human evolutionary path. Might things be better if we could adjust our behavior as you suggest? I'd like to think so, but it probably flies in the face of the way humans are wired.

With hindsight, Lincoln should have let them go.  I think now is the time for the blue states to secede and form its own union with peoples with like minds.  Why should California, New York and other blue states prop up red states like Mississippi, Arkansas and Wyoming with blue tax money?  They should not.

Perhaps, to move forward, we need to let or cause them to go away, so we can build something that will work.  Maybe we are really witnessing that process, which may explain how ugly politics have become, similar to a forest fire destroying to allow for new growth.  If a relatively moderate senator like Lamar Alexander, who is not running for re-election, says Trump did what  impeachment Article I alleges, but that his corrupt actions do not warrant Trump's removal from office, or even a fulsome inquiry, then Congress no longer has a meaningful oversight role with respect to the Executive Branch.  In that case, we need to acknowledge the destruction of Congress and create a new institution that will work.  The alternative is to accept a dictatorship, which I am not ready or willing to do.

These distractions have blinded us to the unprecedented global crisis ahead.\n \nClimate change threatens to extinguish the human race.    Australia and California are on fire; Europe and Alaska are overheating; drought is rampant  in Asia and Africa.  Already these changes have led to mass human migrations in Central America,  the Middle East and Africa. All are related to starvation and local wars. .\n\nWho's  responsible for all of this?  As the cartoon character Pogo, once said \"We have met the enemy... and he is us\".  \nOur country is behind in leading the global effort to prevent this crisis that, left unchecked, will be irreversible during this century. \n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher.  If we don't deal with climate change now, our descendants will experience the global chaos of mass extinction. \n\nThat is the \"existential\" threat to our nation and our planet.",

The arts are a wonderful way to learn about each other. The problem isn't in what is being created, but in how it is being promoted.  Sadly, in this era of ego, where being Number One is considered the only justification for any action, the crass promotion of the arts reinforces this kind of selfish thinking. We live in a society where only Number One matters, and being anything else is considered absolute failure. The trappings of this kind of promotion lives in the images we see on television, People and US magazines, and within the arts sections of newspapers. The Oscars, Grammys, Emmys, Tonys, and other prizes are all background noise to the promotion of winner-takes-all thinking. They ignore the depth of the arts in favor of temporary champions everyone forgets within a day or two.  This kind of thinking places instant gratification above everything else, and it's a fools game. Think about it - rather than focus on the images being presented, the sounds being heard, and the ideas being proposed, everything is reduced to a contest of clothing choices, interviews, and competition for the sake of winning a little statue or some money. Do people go into the arts to win prizes? Or do they do it to communicate and learn? I say toss the awards. Use the arts as a form of community celebration to show the way for all of us.",

But the other side thought it was too radical to make health care affordable to the poor and middle class, and protested bitterly about providing medical insurance for the entire nation.   \n\n When Obama engaged in his signing statements that was anathema to the other side.  They thus had one plan in mind: destroy everything Obama did with the most brash, inexperienced and  disliked candidate they could muster. \n\nMeanwhile, they stood in direct opposition to everything he proposed, trying to make him a one-term president, and not accepting his presidency.  They even behaved consitutionally   hostile by disallowing his nomination of Merrick Garland.  \n\nThe Republican base, and they alone, created this immense division because they basically tarred and feathered the previous president with the current bully-in-chief.

Citizens have been convinced that a $800 Billion annual military budget is sustainable but that Medicare & Social security are not.

That a President who wants to become a Dictator and now has a Senate complicit in re-writing the Constitution the same way the Nazis re-wrote Germany's through the enabling act is actually a Patriot. The reason Bernie Sanders resonates is that he is unapologetic about waging war on the 1%. The 1% has been waging war on America for 40 years. Now Brooks wants to make these same people into weavers of a community? Democrats don't want a Weaver. They realize that they need a fighter. They realize that we the people who believe in fair play are tired of losing the game to a small group of cheaters. This is why Bernie currently is leading.

All of this is neither bad nor good on the face of it, if we can adapt to the change and still thrive.\n\nUnderpinning it all, it seems to me though, is a drive to excess. Buddhists talk about the Middle May, self discipline and concern for the other. This is not America. We want our economy ever expanding, cars splashier, our houses bigger, our phones faster, our income neverendingly increasing, our bodies never to grow old, our sex lives to never end, our social media remarks to be brash and controversial etc. etc. Why ?

There is no individual conscience that is operative in politicians that belong to a political party, almost all of them need to be sent to a cult de-programmer to have their separation from the pack anxiety addressed, so they potentially might have some use to their constituents and use their own free will at some time before they leave office. The conclusion for anyone really paying attention to the direction of this country's politics in the past few decades is that weaving or coming together for the greater good is getting increasingly less possible unless we have more parties with diversity of thought or none at all, so that officeholders could potentially decide their position on issues without looking over their shoulder.",

Brooks himself was once a vocal champion of these policies and remains sympathetic to them.\n\n\"Liberalism\" is a political, not an economic doctrine and was birthed more than a century before the era of free markets.  Liberalism does not endorse radical or \"atomistic\" individualism.  It emphasizes the importance of political liberty and individual rights, which are necessary as a shield against the abuse of state power.  And it embraces the idea of popular sovereignty and responsible government.  Liberals believe that the power exercised by government is bestowed on it in trust by the people, who retain the right to judge the performance of their government.\n\nSome liberals, like J.S. Mill, dearly value personal autonomy, but they do not take this to mean independence from society, much less an abhorrence of community and collaboration.  Autonomous persons cooperate with others out of choice, not mindlessly in conformity with tradition or in blind obedience to authority.",

That conflict, never fully resolved, becomes destructive when those holding the vast economic wealth exaggerate their economic freedom for power and reduce the economic and political freedom of others. That the wealthy claim unrestrained corporate freedom from social responsibility and regulation reminds me of a passage from \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,\" along the lines of, \"those who claim unbounded freedom are usually those who already have it.\"\n\nHowever, the real tragedy is that the labels of the political spectrum are the subject of discussion among pundits, parties and politicians (now used mostly as pejoratives by various \"sides\"), while decades of party intransigence have passed without addressing the necessities of aging infrastructure, unsustainable health care and military costs and dealing with the educational and economic adjustments for fast changing technology and help overcoming the US racial and religious prejudices so prevalent in the news today.",

But it is important to keep in mind that what unites us all is a much stronger bond than that which divides us.  Our common humanity is predicated upon certain universal truths: our superior abilities to reason, our desire to improve and learn and an inherent ability to cooperate and work together.  Many animal species live in social units and support these units.  Some level of collaboration is witnessed among primates.  But it is only humans who perfected the art of working together to create all the trappings of the world as we know it. For millions of years our pre-human ancestors roamed the globe but only changed it very little. Then humans came along and working together they built entire civilizations and the many conveniences we take fore granted in our daily lives.  To forget that fact and allow our individualism and tribalism to rip us apart is a dishonor to all the giants on whose shoulders we stand today.  This is a universal message. It applies equally well in Washington as it does in Beirut or Beijing.",

It's the Republican Party that has been acting as if it were at war, in which anything goes (for example, not even a hearing for Garland), and acting as if rank dishonesty is justified (as it is in war).  Trump (echoed by Fox and some Republican members of Congress) refers to Democrats as corrupt, as liars, and as haters, even saying that they hate our country.  Whereas of course the truth is that it is he and Fox who are fomenting hatred in the Republican base, they who are the liars.  Trump screams that the press is fake when it is he who is a fake, etc.  So yes, we've been driven apart.  But the Democrats have not been doing the driving.  One unscrupulous party is responsible.  Brooks should name them!",

It quotes the participants as wanting to reduce American workers to a class of wage slaves, ignorant and too busy struggling to survive to find time to make trouble for their employers.  Making trouble includes unionizing, public demonstrations, letters to media, even voting.  Why do you think that so much effort is put into voter suppression as we speak?",

It's a Christianity that is unrecognizable to me. It has no grace, compassion, or charity, but is confrontational, vindictive, and militant. I do not understand the values these people have. They have their constituents terrified and angry, largely about problems that simply do not exist. I find the leadership power mad and morally corrupt. Unfortunately, leaders on the left are ineffectual in countering this blizzard of misinformation and intolerance. Their messaging incompetence has allowed a groundswell of extreme conservative ideology to become mainstream. I cannot imagine sitting in a room with the new American conservative and saying \" so, your contribution is to get rid of clean air and water, codify discrimination against gay people which we will call \"religious freedom\", and to insist that people seeking asylum in the country have enough money to move here. Okay, that's acceptable to me if you agree to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour\". There appears to be no forward thinking by conservatives in the era of Trump, just a desire to roll back the clock to when old white men told us all how to live.",

Beginning with Nixon the Republican Presidents and politicians have consistently and repeatedly lied, deceived, and cheated to maintain power at all costs for the benefit of the wealthy and big business.\nConsider the last 5 elected Republican Presidents:\nNixon: multiple crimes to ensure re-election;\nReagan: secretly sells arms to Iran in hopes of getting return of\n    hostages, and contrary to an express Congressional prohibition,       \n    uses the profits from the sales to fund a civil war in South \n    America;\nBush I: lies about his knowledge of Iran-Contra and (with the help  \n     Bill Barr) pardons all of the conspirators who were involved;\nBush II: manipulates intelligence and lies about Iraq\u2019s \u201cweapons\u201d\n     of mass destruction to obtain authorization to invade Iraq.\n\nThis is not even close to defining the hypocrisy and corruption of the Republican Party.  For example, an objection examination of spending,  taxation, and deficits since 1981 establishes that notwithstanding their claim of financial conservatism, the GOP is responsible for the growth of our nation\u2019s debt. Another example is the number of people in Republican administrations convicted of corruption. Think James Watt.\n\nAll of this is open and obvious yet in 2016 the most dishonest and corrupt President, a Republican, is elected.  Wake up America.",

Lamar Alexander's duplicitous statement marks the moment when the Republican Party refused to hold to account \u2014 indeed, knowingly supported \u2014 the most venal, criminal administration in the nation\u2019s history, the attempted final suffocation of our republic.  \n\nThe outright lies, red herrings and gross distortions offered up by White House lawyers at the impeachment proceeding all indicate jaw-dropping arrogance and cynicism, and no regard whatsoever for fundamental American principles.\n\nWhere there once was some semblance of democracy, freedom and equality, a corrupt and brutal oligarchy is rising.  I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my 70+ years.\n\nWe might, just might, have one last chance to resuscitate the victim in November.  But who knows what other tactics the GOP will use to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen; I\u2019m not optimistic.\n\nReprinted without permission from \nCritical Rationalist\nColumbus, Ohio",

There's a sense of satisfaction involved in doing nice things for other people. Your decision is therefore selflessly self-interested.\n\nThe extreme example is very id.

The social reality is that people in their full diversity live and work, form friendship and families, study and find careers, run businesses and build lives, and, in doing so, they weave their lives and fates together. This is not true just in the coastal cities\u2014Houston and Dallas are now immigrant gateway cities, Oklahoma has the fastest growing interracial marriage rate in the country, and Kansas will cheer on their bi-racial quarterback this Super Bowl Sunday.

Scott Walker, a cynical, self absorbed politician, presaged Trumpism by six years in Wisconsin. If you travel across our country, you will see a nation that is riddled with homelessness, drug addiction, hopelessness, and dismal, dilapidated sprawl. Over 20 veterans commit suicide every day along with the increasing suicide rate among all Americans. Our system held together all these years because it was largely inhabited by people of good will and good conscience. That simply doesn't exist anymore. The reality is that the unscrupulous, unconstrained, have unlimited power under our system. If there are truly people of good will left, they are few and far between in politics. I am afraid there is no going back, and it can never be the way it was. Anyone with optimism is not living in the real world.",

Remember, it was Reagan and Thatcher, those scions of current republicans, that were some of the main popularizes of \"the individual is everything\" and Milton Friedman the godfather of the economics of greed. \n\nIt is unfortunate that we are at a point where we must fight for community and egalitarianism, contrary to Brook's vision, but those of us on the left did not ask for this!",

If \u2018Individualism\u2019 is one bookend and \u2018The Group\u2019 is the other, then you find that you can rank countries as to where they are on that continuum between those extremes.   What you find is that the US is far to the individualistic end of the spectrum with Europe in the middle and Asia on the other end.  \n\nIn fact, you can\u2019t truly understand the rest of the world until you understand this concept.  For example, China will never give up \u2018State Capitalism\u2019 because it is the gold star in \u2018Group\u2019 culture.  Believing that you can change that behavior is utterly laughable since it is an inherent part of their culture.\n\nAt one point in time, the US leapfrogged the world with individualism.  However, we have long hit the point of diminishing returns.  In fact, our culture needs to move in the other direction both socially and economically.  \nFrom this point forward, we need to add elements of \u2018The Team\u2019 to our culture.  The NFL is not just a collection of individuals, it\u2019s also requires teamwork if you have any hope of winning.  If we don\u2019t add elements of teamwork to our culture, we will just fade away.",

We have lots of bonding social capital which links those of like minds together, but the threads between us that form bridging social capital between different classes in increasingly absent. Many of our cities are evidence of this...individuals groups become NIMBYs. They do not want those poorer than them living close by. The very wealthy have virtually severed their ties with all. They live inside walled/gated communities, helicopter in and out and reinforce among themselves a narrative that the poor more or less get what they deserve. I do not see Sanders arguing for more interaction between the poor and wealthy. I certainly don't see the wealthy arguing for more interaction with the poor. It is said the Nelson Rockefeller would have to walk through poor neighborhoods to work every day. He would carry nickels with him to give to poor shoe-shine kids. When you must look those who are disadvantaged in the eye, the eye softens. When those who are suffering see empathy among those better off, they soften their hard class lines as well. We would all do well to go back to Winthrop's City on a Hill sermon and admonish those who have that they have an obligation that must be freely given to those who are less advantaged.",

Supposedly because its just too individualistic and creates a rat race to the bottom of a bunch of well educated people working for finance and tech companies in big cities.  Solution: We need more leadership from the center!  Um, I thought neoliberal democrats were centrists.  Seriously, your grand solution is elect a centrist Democrat (read: neoliberal) instead of Bernie Sanders.  Because all the neoliberal elites don't find Sanders cooperative enough.  Also, Ro Khanna has a great proposal to bring research funds and technology hubs to rural America!  Right, because farming is the same thing as research and technology.  In addition to this article being superficial, it makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nAlso, I don't think we need more open office, high collaborative work spaces.  I'm an introvert, I don't like that sort of thing.\n\nI think the real answer is there is a balance between the individual and society.  Also a balance between work and having a personal life, something sadly lost in our society.  And we need to stop using social media.  And raise taxes, get single payer healthcare, and strictly regulate Big Tech.  Just a thought.",

That is a false equivalence.\n\nThe concern that libertarianism (as opposed to communitarianism),and a frequent bete noire of Brooks, has fractured American society into small interest groups is certainly a valid. It is however a problem not of the liberal state but of a brand of conservatism- in fact a central tenet of trumpian populism where the \"state\" (or \"deep state\" in the preferred argot of the right wing populist) is to be defeated at all costs and thereby empower individuals to operate free from constraint. But the state, as the guarantor and facilitator of the individual's material happiness and the integrator of individual interests into a community, is in fact the linchpin of Lockean \"liberalism\" and diametric to \"libertarianism\".",

Many of us want families & the extra burdens and responsibilities that entails. All of us want our lives to be easier and with more benefits. We all are NIMBYs to a certain extent and become a little nationalistic (even at the local level) when we see Mr. and Mrs Jones getting ahead while you may be standing still. \n\n- and there is the rub. \n\nWe see, feel and live injustices each and every day. They may be small (which might fester) or they may be large, where homes, futures or lives are lost. \n\n- And therein lies the rub as well. \n\nWe do NOT have a system that cares (realistically or humanely) for all people the same. We have a system that is corrupt and influenced by money or power. None of us have really seen a true Socialist (or even Liberal for that matter) system in action that does the above. We get little snippets and crumbs here and there to assuage us or convince us that we are going in the right direction. \n\nIt is not populist to want to have a better life, nor is it populist to want the same for thy neighbor. (regardless of who they are or where they come from) \n\nFor now we keep getting the labels.",

I would agree that the state of American Politics is fractured based on self-interest and disagreement which is obvious.  The real difficulty for American Politics is that the leadership role of each individual Congressional member cannot stand on their own merits, only the merits of the political party which often is out-of-touch with the many societal cultures which reside in their constituency.  The other problem is Congressional members tend to only listen to supporters which further divides the public.  Due to the advent of negative campaigning and hatred of opponents politically,  change is a pipe-dream at best.",

When Thomas Jefferson deleted the anti-slavery language from the Declaration of Independence  that he'd intended in the first place he did so to keep the 13 colonies united in the coming war for U.S. independence.

How does it follow that I, the tax payer, have to provide public funds for them to exercise that choice.\"\n\nThose parents are ALSO taxpayers. Why should they be required to subsidize a public school system that many of them (for a variety of reasons) find inferior for their children? \n\nThe education of one's children is something most parents consider to be one of the most important decisions they can make. And yet it is currently a decision over which parents have almost the least choice. \n\nCity and State governments tell them where their children will go. Parents that can afford it will actually choose where to buy a house based on the local school systems. \n\nForget religious vs. sectarian schools, why shouldn't all schools be run with vouchers? All parents have to pay taxes for primary and secondary education, which is mandatory in the USA (a good thing). \n\nThere's a lot of talk about \"fixing\" education.\n\nMost solutions involve changes in how government controls it. Want to really fix it? Put vouchers in the hands of every parent, and let them send their children wherever they like. Bad schools would close quite quickly. Funds would flow to schools that produced excellent education in a safe environment. \n\nNo government official will EVER love my kids, nor try to optimize for them at levels even remotely approaching those that I do. Take my taxes, but give ME the choice.",

But it also found that the Department of Revenue lacked the authority to modify the program to exclude religious schools. Because the law authorized what the state constitution prohibited\u2014funding religious schools\u2014the entire law had to be struck down. That meant no private school received funding.\"\n\nThe WSJ column urged the Supreme Court to recognize \"that Blaine amendments are discriminatory on their face [and] single out religious institutions for worse treatment than their secular counterparts. Any time government gives effect to such a provision, it violates the First Amendment\u2019s requirement of religious neutrality. While it may be true that religious schools are not the only ones now denied the benefit of the tax-credit program, the Montana Supreme Court still gave effect to a religiously discriminatory rule. Striking down a program that would benefit religious schools on that basis should be enough to trigger First Amendment protection.\"\n\nQ. E. D.",

While Montana's legislative intent might be a factor in the Supreme Court's decision, conceptually I see no distinction.",

Benjamin Franklin said these words \"When a religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and, when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support it, so that its Professors are obliged to call for the help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one.\" So we can say when the government of any state is calling on the taxpayers to support private schools the Christian religion, which is what the tax money will go for, is a bad Christianity. A good Christianity separates church and state just like Jesus did when He said \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar and to God the things that are God's.\"",

Use your own money if you want to send your children to any school that's not publicly funded. It does feel as if this isn't about religious but more about control. There's a lot of money behind controlling the masses. Churches are supposed to instill values into people and compel people in that way. But they want the gov't to do their job of enforcing their beliefs into society. Morally does need to be taught especially today with morally corrupt leaders at the helm who have no problem with blatant lies and their moral corruptness daily.

Those same parents might not be able to afford a home in the best neighborhood, to send their kid to sports camp or to buy their kid's clothes at Niemann Marcus, either, but no one is suggesting that it should, therefore, be taxpayer funded... \n\nIt often seems that one tactic of the religious right is to muddy the waters. Here that is between \"exercise\" of religion and funding for that exercise. With school prayer it is between a student's right to pray (always there) and school endorsement of religion, e.g., teacher leading the class in prayer, prayer over the public address system etc.  They apparently are also pretending that providing federal funds for a playground surface (not  religious even in a religious school) and funding the school's mission, e.g., religion-based education of pupils are one and the same.

The white middle class  reacted by forming a coalition with plutocrats in the GOP to withdraw support from public education, gradually in most areas, dramatically in the South. The coalition still exists, still controls most states, and retains tenuous control at the federal level, which it wields with increasing ferocity and brutality. It is now in a position to enforce the starvation of public education though interpretations of the Constitution made by Supreme Court justices who sympathize with the desire of the coalition, whose backbone is the approximately 60% of white people who, like the aforementioned justices, want to minimize funding for programs that help people who aren\u2019t white. The quality of public education has suffered and will suffer more, along with many other beneficial programs, as SCOTUS works its way through an agenda favoring the mostly white coalition.",

The government is not dictating anything about any religion.\n\nSo we spend public money on literally every other item mentioned in the First Amendment, and nobody makes the argument that it is being violated in any of those cases, but if we spend public money - without \"establishing a religion\" - on private educational institutions, we have somehow violated the Constitution?\n\nEither all of these activities are unconstitutional or none of them are.",

Like the Prodigal Son we do. Damnation thus is ensured. But God doesn't want that so he provides a way back to him w/out giving up our free will: Christ's passion is that means. \n\nThe Prodigal Son & much of the Gospel is about us exercising free will in our search for truth, in hopes that it will lead us back to God. Secular govt makes our own search for truth more possible.\n\nIn mid60s per Leo Strauss GOP decided to use religion to control masses & yank them to the right ie the opposite of Christ's will & evangelicals is where they've got the most traction.

I was always had the understanding that religious freedom was defined as the state (e.g. the government) could not establish a national religion. That citizens had the right to practice their own form of religion without government interference. Religious freedom has now been broadened, it seems, to require taxpayers like me (agnostic and not practicing any formal religion) to use my tax dollars to support religious institutions that I do not support financially in any other way. To me this is great distortion of religious freedom and allows governments to now take sides in religious issues that should remain with the individual religious institutions. If a family wishes to send their children to a religious or any other private school they should do so at their own expense and not be entitled to taxpayer dollars to do so. Between charter schools and religious affiliated schools the use of tax dollars should be unconstitutional. Tax dollars should go to public schools only.",

Nevertheless, the government, with taxpayers' money funds Catholic schools but not schools of other religions (Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, non-Catholic Christian denominations) - parents need to pay for these other schools with their own money. Now, this set up is because of historical reasons and is naturally hard to change. People who are receiving some benefit or privilege are loathe to give it up and can find all sorts of reasons to justify it. The Catholic schools do provide excellent educations  and some local boards are loosening attendance rules so that non-Catholics may attend but doing it discreetly and can still turn away students. Officially, Canada is a 'secular' country but these anomalies exist throughout. For me, if the choice came down to having my kids obtain an excellent education at a local Catholic school versus a worse education at a public school, I'd likely choose the former even if would mean obligatory religious instruction in a religion different to our own.",

However, no one who has read history will deny the tendency of religious adherents, once they have manipulated society into recognizing how special they are, to credit their own specious assertions that they should be free in the name of their deity to intimidate and coerce.\n\nBack when reality was sheer guesswork, educating children that fairy tales were the truth was only one among many sad choices. Ignorant of consequences, multiple societies assigned education to those whose edification agendas were merged with their calls to spread their \"faith.\"\n\nElsewhere today, an author worries about the magnified impact of the Coronavirus in a country where so many citizens have now deny science and so deprive their children of needed inoculations for measles and other diseases. Although the Christians' origin story, along with the hierarchy of deities and fellow travelers, might actually be true, meaning that those of us who don't believe will suffer dire post-life consequences, temporal consequences will be suffered not only by those who appear to think themselves purer than science but also by so many they eventually infect.\n\nI was schooled by Catholics. I know more about seraphim than how my digestive system works. Subsidizing such a pernicious waste of children's time subordinates government to religion, which hasn't worked yet.

The House and Ohio Senate are at odds here on how to shrink the programs, due to a flawed metric that defines \"low performing\" schools. It is now a back door to funneling money to families at any (high) income level, subsidizing their child's parochial education.\n\nAs a result, the number of schools from which parents are now eligible to pull their kids -- and send to them to a private schools \u2013 is more than double last year's. The number will go from just less than 500 to 1,200 in the next academic year.\n\nSurprise. It will bankrupt the public school districts and destroy secular education.

Davey, without literally any constitutional backing), this is clearly a case of the conservative wing of the supreme court going against their own origination interpretations of the constitution to fabricate a new expanded right of religious institutions to have access to American taxpayer's money.",

            "comment_body": "\"Religious freedom.\" A new mantra to go along with \"job creators,\" \"entitlements,\" and \"death tax,\" to name a few. A major move towards theocracy and the ending of public education as we know it. Charter schools were only the intermediate step. The most activist Court in history is, once again, going to ignore precedent and reasoned Constitutional analysis in order to push their right wing agenda. Forget Roberts, the Chief Justice who is supposedly so concerned about the public's perception of the federal judiciary. Many of us have gotten it right for years- the Supreme Court majority is nothing more than an extension of the Republican Party (corrupt and cultish as it is) and its benefactors.",

            "comment_body": "I am not sure the conservatives realize the potential repercussions of their argument that the state not giving them money means that \"their free exercise is being penalized.\" This sounds like an argument more similar to that in European countries, where the state supports all religious institutions out of the public till in order to protect their free exercise. This has led to resentment of religious institutions and their role in society. \n\nAs a former public school teacher who dealt with children from voucher schools coming into high school with undiagnosed learning disabilities, wacky understandings of science and an inability to sit in mixed-gender classrooms, I certainly resent the role of religious voucher schools in society. Some of my students were unlikely to ever graduate high school because it would take so long for them to be properly diagnosed and accommodated after years of neglect. Depending on the outcome of this case, soon people in all fifty states might begin to feel a similar resentment to mine.",
