What they don't seem to grasp is that selective defense of rights is no defense of rights at all.  What they actually defend is privilege for those who defend the political actors and policies they support and punishment for those who criticize or oppose them.  Trump would certainly approve.",

In this  context who cares what they think about Assange and/or Greenwald. Particularly if they feel negatively towards them. In another context it would be more than relevant what they  think. Obviously if they liked either or both  there would be an extra level of intensity in protecting them. Because you would also be joining them for other reasons. But this  assault on them  is an assault on all of us. These people are in prison. Assange  essentially is being tortured. His health is crashing. It is not like a column of his has been dropped because a newspaper doesn't agree with him. Repressive forces always look for  a wedge as they initially start tearing away  people's rights. And not to be ferocious in our response makes us suckers of the worst kind.\nFree Glenn Greenwald! Free Chelsea Manning! Free Julian Assange!",

It has gotten so bad that even the Obama administration went after whistle blowers and the journalist who worked with them, using the 1918 Espionage  Act more time than all previous presidents combined. Gee, I wonder where Trump got his idea that he could attack the press?\nThe lack of outrage, particularly by American journalists and news outlets, about the treatment and persecution of Assange who revealed war crimes and other unsavory things about our government and its officials, really set the stage for this. Why should other governments respect the press when our own press  doesn't even care. This newspaper is one of the more shocking examples of the apathy towards Assange, You would think that a paper that published the Pentagon Papers would be leading the charge. The corporate takeover of the mainstream news outlets is basically complete. Now, they will move on to silence the independent journalists on other platforms a like Youtube, saying, of course, that it is \"fake\" news (sound familiar?), or drum up unsupported charges like they did with the Grayzone editor Max Blumenthal.",

Their printing presses were smashed, their businesses were burned, and some were hauled away in chains. Many had bounties on their heads.

As we have seen from the analyses of Vietnam and Iraq, governments have a way of telling stories to fit the outcome they desire. It is up to those who would inform us to reveal falsehoods and grossly misleading statements from our government. An independent press gives us a measure of security that we would sorely miss. It is debatable that Assange is a journalist or a spy, but he deserves his day in court. It would be a gross injustice if his case were used to muzzle journalists and dissenters.

In 2016, Matthew Keyes was arrested for passing along log in information to the organization, \"Anonymous.\"  In 2013 Aaron Swartz was charged with breaking a University computer system's terms of agreement & was charged with the federal Computer Fraud & Abuse law & sentenced to 50 years in jail although hung himself before being imprisoned.\n\nTo me, Edward Snowden is a huge hero who gave up a $300,000 year contracting job while living in Hawaii to share his inside information revealing what the NSA was gathering from everyday citizens as well as other seemingly abuses of power.

Unlike most Trumpers, he is very intelligent and ruthless. He was our Congressperson, I know his \u201c work \u201c and showmanship very well. He has Trumps ear, and will stop at nothing to complete his own desires, and plans.  The stars are aligned for a Pompeo Presidential bid in 2024. He\u2019s hedging his bets, with an extreme show of loyalty to Trump, but a plan to hedge his bets, when Trump implodes. \n   His greatest enemy is NOT Democrats, but a free and truthful press. You can run, Mike. Perhaps all the way back to Kansas. \nBut, you can\u2019t hide forever. Even IN Kansas.",

If the wave against journalism is so widespread, there must be an underlying strategy of clamping down on freedom. The story yesterday of the NPR reporter being yelled at by Pompeo was very telling. It indicates that the Republicans are either accustomed to journalist's taking orders, in that the expectation of service reveals an unacknowledged fact that some do. Beyond fake news from journalists, it seems the idea of fake news originating from the government is finally being revealed. Pompeo's agitation belied the expectation.\n\nThe fact is, the government spreads fake news and the attacks on journalists is preemptive diversionary brainwashing. I learned early on, people always believe the first story told, meaning the governments are spreading the false story claiming stories are false Ask why courtroom prosecutors always present a case first and most people are convicted.\n\nI have practical experience incurring the wrath of government falsehoods and lying. They have portrayed me as a villain to preemptively destroy me so no one cares, even joins in on the gauntlet. Republicans are nothing more than a lynch mob.",
