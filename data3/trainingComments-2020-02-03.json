The fatal maulings and extreme injuries inflicted by these dogs increase every year and pitbull rescues continue unabated. These dogs were bred to go for the throat and fight to the death-why are they being given to families with children. Why do we have to see them on the streets at all?",

The GOP has now showed us who they really are and what they're really about.  This past weekend, I visited my parents on the east coast of FL and driving back to the west coast of FL, I passed a stand with pro Trump flags including Confederate flags.  Secondly, Millie is experiencing unconditional love - the kind of love that few of us experience.  There is no way that I am able to give the kind of unconditional love I reserve for my cats, to humans, despite all the meditation and yoga I do.  Just ask my spouse.",

My daughter assumed it was mistreatment during the dog's early life. But I was skeptical.  \n\nIn talking with my vet, we agreed that rescuers tend to falsely assume that they have rescued their dogs from bad homes and bad treatment.  That didn't seem to be true with my new dog.  The fighting problem lessened when the dog shared my home with one elderly dog who seldom put up a fight.   And now that the dog is the only one in the home, her behavior is pretty much perfect.  And she also is  doing well around people now that she's been in the same home for six months.  \n\nThe dog's frequent eccentricities, which we thought might be a sign of senility, have much improved since she underwent dental work, removing painful teeth.  And she hadn't been groomed in a year because she couldn't sit still for the groomer.  That was taken care of by use of a tranquilizer.  So now she doesn't scratch her silky coat and looks younger and better..\n\nThere probably aren't millions of desperate and mistreated dogs out there.  Most are abandoned for mundane reasons. And the main cause of distress of our rescue dogs is often  just getting used to us.",

I would merit her disdain on both counts. Became a vegetarian many years ago after reading James Rachel\u2019s \u201cCreated from Animals; the Moral Implications of  Darwinism\u201d. Couldn\u2019t overcome his arguments so stopped eating meat. However, I rationalized, and rationalized, and continued eating dairy and eggs until within the past year, until I realized that my intellectual dishonesty was not a good thing, so I quit those things also. But I and my wife have also had many dogs, all strays who found us, so guilty on that count too. But I want to make a point that might be unpleasant for some to read, because there are many good people who want a pure-bred dog and will buy their dog from a breeder. But they should consider the implications of this. Many years ago I worked at a humane society shelter on weekends. We would work all weekend, would be so happy when we could find a good home for a dog or cat, or maybe even a few, and then I would return home and look in the local paper and see column after column of ads from breeders, many from \u201cbackyard\u201d breeders but others from \u201clegitimate\u201d breeders, who were trying to sell a multitude of puppies (and a few cats). This was very discouraging.  Even more discouraging was to realize that many of these dogs would be seen later in the shelter, or would themselves be bred, with still more puppies.",

As you now know, a household is not complete unless there is a four-legged child in it (who will usually be running it).\n\nMy late wife and our late Airedale Afghan daughter dog selected each other more than thirty (30) years ago at the local pound.  As I have told anyone who cared to listen, once these two (2) sets of beautiful brown eyes saw each other, it was all over.\n\nMy wife often referred to Muffin as her easiest pregnancy!  \n\nWhen a dog is in a good home (as Muffin's was and as Millie's is), a dog that has been abused starts to relax.  Millie learned that she is safe in her home and then something special has happened; the canine personality (unique to every dog) starts to ooze out of every pore!\n\nEnjoy the comfort, joy, and love that Millie will add to your home for as long as she lives.",

She was petrified of males, particularly teen-aged males. She hid under the bed whenever my son and his friends were around. She was fine with women, but it took her almost a year before she would tolerate being around my husband and son. When I would come home from work, I sang a song for her to get her out from under the bed (a parody of the old Four Seasons song, \"Sherry\"): \"Steffi, bay-yay-bee, won't you come out tonight?\" She would. The other two dogs pampered her as well. It was funny to watch the others lead her around the house and yard, as if to tell her everything was all right. She was a big lug for a dachshund; she finally calmed down to the point where she loved everyone. We knew she was in pain one day when she snapped at and tried to bite one of the other dogs. She had bladder cancer. \n\nOur house is so silent, so very, very silent and sad with no dog in it. I keep looking down at my feet, thinking, hoping, that some little creature will greet me with his or her wagging tail, but then I remember that last November we said goodbye to our last little guy. I'm looking to rescue someone new. Maybe next month. When there's a promise of a new spring.",

Joy blasted out of my guardedness when we started talking about music and what he plays during procedures. He promised he'd play Motown for me, a native Detroiter.\n\nWhen they wheeled me in for the procedure he announced that they'd be playing Motown. The nurses were delighted & cranked it up on the computer. Each staff person I met was loving, enthusiastic, & friendly. It felt like a party.\n\nThis doctor went out of his way to be kind & attentive &, as busy as he is, was always fully present. He gave me his personal cell#, called me at home, and stopped by to see me during a routine wound check appt. \n\nThe amazing technology definitely calmed my heart, yet the kindness has had a profound impact, especially after so many trials over the years.",

Each has come with their own story; many of which we'll never know the details.  I can only surmise these potential possibilities after sometimes, months of observing them.  Thankfully, most of these 'throwaway dogs' have overcome their fears with the good treatment we give them.  However, I think back to one I adopted at an elderly age from running the streets of Aberdeen, WA for an unknown amount of time with a mouthful of severe dental disease, who despite years of my loving treatment, could never relax, could never trust me, and therefore could never shed the pain she endured before I adopted her.  For her and others like her,  I shed tears and apologize to them for their undeserved horrific life on their deathbed.  It truly sickens me that such a huge population of these dogs exist today and we, as a society, need to examine our motives and the commitments we make when we adopt these animals.  We are surely not doing them a good deed.",

Now people brag about having \u201ca rescue.\u201d It\u2019s wonderful to see the change is attitude toward second-hand dogs: they are now valued and even coveted. But the mythos of The Rescue has gone too far. Everyone wants a dog with a good backstory. For some unscrupulous or perhaps just misguided people, rescue dogs are now just another business. Dogs are being scooped up from pounds and hoarded \u2014 sometimes in horrible conditions \u2014 trucked across the country, sold for outrageous sums. Some weeks ago a van full of rescue dogs was stolen from a hotel parking lot near here. The dogs had been transported from another state, in stacked crates, to be delivered to their \u201cadopters.\u201d The driver had left them in their crates in the van, overnight. The person who stole the van had sold some of the animals before the van was found. Poor dogs.\n\nPlease adopt locally, from the pound or a vetted rescue group!",

When Kim took Flip out for a behavior assessment walk he literally flipped out, winding himself around her legs, rolling over on the ground in a panicked state, thus his name Flip. When she took him back to the shelter she said, No, I don\u2019t think so, and the shelter lady replied, We\u2019re killing him tomorrow. Flip went home with Kim.\nFlip spent the first 3 months under her stereo cabinet. When we met him 8 years ago Flip had been with Kim a full year. He was still so fearful the first week we had to pretend we were looking at the clouds and not noticing that he was peeing. It turned out that we had him just 10 days then had to go on a previously arranged vacation. Flip was devastated when we temporarily took him back to Kim, thinking we were rejecting him. Our vacation turned out to be less than fun (we both got miserable colds) so we said, forget this, let\u2019s just go home and get our dog.\nWhen we went to pick Flip up he was back to his old anxious self, smashed up again the screen door wanting back into Kim\u2019s house. Driving up our long gravel road he stopped hiding and looked out the window. We pulled up to the house and Flip raced to the front door. In the house he joyously ran through all of the rooms, up the stairs and down. It still took a year of daily gentle massages to convince Flip he was really home. Forever.",

I was sickened; in that moment I committed to never abuse him again. I kept that promise; it took years but Strider eventually healed & honored me with his trust - a miracle of love.\n\nTwenty years after his passing, a rescue came into my life  (against my desires), a 12lb Chihuahua mix. Me: \"not a small dog fan . . .\" \n\nWithin 24 hrs I knew this innocent pup was badly abused - I knew the symptoms via my own sordid past. \n\nMy heart broke; I knew I was being gifted with a chance at redemption.

So I pet him, cuddled him, laughingly pushed him out of the way.  He settled against my back for a few minutes before getting up to check the food bowl or to do his catly rounds.\n\nAnd then I read this and remembered the *other* JB, the cat of five years ago.  His former owner (a neighbor) thought that he was a b-a-d c-a-t (we spell that phrase around here now!).  Nothing he did was right: he got yelled at for killing *mice*, he got put into a cage for growling at a stray cat in his yard, he was \"unfriendly\" and \"antisocial\", he was wild and uncontrollable.  His owner was convinced that he was half wild cat--she had a complicated theory about a former wild animal park in the area.\n\nWe took him in when his owner went into a nursing home.  For the first two weeks we couldn't touch him and he cringed away if we \"caught\" him playing with a cat toy.  Then one night he came into my room and put a paw up on my bed as if to ask if it was allowed.  I invited him up and he let me scritch him, but he was still unsure about the whole thing until I got to the magic spot between the shoulder blades, when he melted all over my bed.  It was like the first hit of an addictive drug and he's been a love junkie ever since.\n\nWe joke that he's not antisocial, he's Uncle Social.",

The sight of any long object, like a leash, sent him howling upstairs to hide. It was a year before I could bend over to pet him without him flinching. He was bone thin, with a belly full of parasites.\n\nLuckily, my lab, Lucia, won him over. He loved and trusted her, so her trust in me helped change him. After about 6 weeks I heard a strange noise--he'd finally gotten his nerve up to play with her. When he saw her sit by the door when I took out a leash, he tried it too. He stopped crawling. Whenever he was scared or didn't know what to do, he did what she did. The Oriental rug they ripped to shreds? Who cared?\n\nCutter lived to 15. When Lucie passed 4 years earlier, his depression disappeared when I rescued another female lab. \nHe was a brave, brave boy, intelligent and resourceful. After a few years, 99% of the time you'd never know he'd been abused.\n\nI've been rescuing elderly dogs since. I lost one in October and another 2 weeks ago. I'm retiring this fall and looking at an elderly bonded pair because i want to travel and could never give up a dog. But it's hard knowing I'll probably never have a young adult dog again. It's hard to keep losing the seniors, having lost 4 in the last three and a half years.",

When ewe brought her to the vet, she desperately needed to sleep, but was too fearful, and would only relax if I had my hand on her, calming.\nLeilei had never known the dog-human bond. We think she was chained outside, and she was bred many times. She was shakingly afraid of stairs, bowls, noise, and every human but me (and, slowly, my husband). At one point six months or so in, walking, she was attacked by two off-leash bulldogs. I had to pry their jaws off her while the owner apologized helplessly. She came home and huddled in my lap, crying and peeing, and I thought we'd lost all progress - but she bounced back in a day. \n\nToday she's a fluffy white ball of joy (a BIG ball), tail up like a semaphore, endlessly loving to all around us. We joke that her breed is 'attention hound\". And every time we see her gleefully prance to the door, fawn on a visitor, or sleep as she does on her back, snoring, all four paws waving unconcernedly in the air - it's a reminder that healing really happens and that joy is always hiding somewhere just around the next corner. \n\nThank you for this, Ms. Renkl.",

If her routine means that she can demand food from you by physically misbehaving, it's going to continue to happen until you do something to break the habit.

So I adopted him.  \n\nI lived in a second floor Santa Monica apartment, accessible through a public walkway, and took out part of a louvered window so the cat, named Buddy, could roam freely.  Afterwards, whenever I got home, Buddy ran up to me - literally ran.  I felt undeserving of this - I had not brought him any special treats - but Buddy kept doing this for the rest of his life: a one-cat welcome committee.  His affection and trust in me in virtually all things changed my life.  In time, my girlfriend became my ex; Buddy remained my best friend.

When her brother was killed suddenl (he darted out after a squirrel) only 4 months after the very difficult trip to bring them here, it ripped a part of our hearts away. We didn't know if his sister would think we had something to do with his death, having likely seen her littermates killed by dogs or cars. We entered into a world of animal psychology for which it's possible decades of caring for numerous pets in our 5- child household prepared us. But nothing prepared us for her waiting for his return at the window, leaving food in her dish, calling for him. 3 months on, she still leaves food for him, waits at the window or sleeps in the sink where they would cuddle, but it is less now than it was; she cuddles with us, plays with our old dog, watches birds and squirrels from inside the house. When struggling then, with the decision of whether to show her his remains, I wrote to Tammy Billups, author of a beautiful book on our Animal Companions. She wrote back but wisely left the decision to us.That was not to show our girl her brother' body, since trauma was to have been a part of her past. Now, each day we see her sweet, funny personality emerging, and I feel her brother would be very glad, indeed.",

When he did, a neighbor commented on his changed behavior. \"He's got nowhere to run away to any more. He finally knows he's home.\"\n\nA lot of rescue dogs have been mistreated. They're in shelters for a reason. Patience, compassion, love and a stable routine (and treats) can change the outlook of many dogs. It's important for us caretakers to let them recover from past trauma for as long as it takes.",

Still, every day this woman patiently walked her dog, distributing treats at all the right moments while training. Now, nearly a year has passed and her dog is calm, well behaved, and adorable. Last month I mustered up the nerve to stop her and say hello, tell her how I've noticed her hard work and ask about her dog. Sure enough, it's a rescue. I told her I was so pleased to see her dedication pay off, that I admired her training skills and passion for her canine companion. Now when we pass one another we just nod, smile and keep moving. It pleases me immensely to see her dedication pay off...and I'm sure her dog knows she's one lucky pup.",

The 9 rescues we have had included 6 tripawds, there was 1 missing eye, 1 suspect eye, and one whose mixed DNA disguised the fact his Mohawk hairdo said \"part Rhodesian Ridgeback\" rather than \"omg, his hackles are up!\"  HE was 100% fully equipped, but those faux hackles had no one adopting him, week after week.  Dogs 2 through 9 owed a thanks to Muffin, our first adoption.  We took her because we were finally ready for our first dog, and a friend was a serial \"Foster\" for a local rescue group.  Only 3 feet or not, it was love at first sight, and the potentially progressive disease known as Rescuing Dogs set in after that.  We reasoned that if we were going to rescue dogs who had no home, we might as well rescue those less likely to be adopted by other people.  We have never looked back or regretted it, we have instead always been grateful for the choice we made, aided greatly by ol' Muffin (RIP) back in 2001.\n\nOne word of caution raised by something Ms Renkl said about gumdrop-stealing dogs: the sugar in some gumdrops, chewing gum, and similar products may not be good for dogs, but it is not fatal.  The sugar-free versions of those products otoh usually contain Xylitol, which can be fatal to dogs.  Be careful about what you leave laying around dogs.",

I sent a lengthy application to NY Boxer rescue (I got my first dog from them.) I paid (donated) $10 to have them evaluate my application. The letter thanking me for the application has a p.s. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if you never hear from us.\u201d  or words to that effect. Eighteen months later and no word. \n\nOut of FIVE rescue organizations, lengthy applications and repeated calls and notes to them, only two would seriously talk with me. I had to provide names and numbers of people to recommend me, which is fine, but letting them know who I was providing their name to and what each rescue wanted to know was annoying to the folks doing the recommending. The rescues would not keep my info and would call the folks again for each individual dog I was interested in. I was really not picky, I dropped the idea of a boxer mix and wanted a young adult female dog which would walk about 5 miles a day and be kind to cats. I went through the application/interview/video of my home process and then was told to wait. \n\nAfter about 3 months of back and forth, I got fed up and went to boxer breeders and adopted a dog which had an emergency c-section and was no longer a good breeder. I drove 10 hours each way to get her. She is a joy!\n\nSound of silence from NY Boxer",

When I come home from work, he behaves as if that moment is the greatest thing that ever happened, charging to and fro, getting up a head of steam, then jumping up against me like a quarterback celebrating a touchdown catch with a receiver. We wrassle and play. He follows me around the house, never an intrusion, just a shadow that keeps me company, just in case.\n\nHe is a dog, but he is my dog, and so he is the best dog in the world.

I am glad that Millie adjusted and became, well, a dog. But neither dogs nor life is so simple. Lots of rescue dogs are rescue dogs for reasons. Rescue organizations, I think, are too prone to pick low-hanging fruit, putting small dogs up for adoption that have wide appeal. But such dogs often have health or behavioral issues difficult to overcome. Having been burned by a so-called rescue group, I speak from experience. No elderly dog with huge health issues should be passed off as much younger and fine.\n\nWe all should enjoy our rescue dogs, but we should not pretend that we are Mother Teresa.

Peep's manage was so bad he had no fur. Popeye had belonged to someone once and his training and good nature were obvious. He had taken a tiny, mangy puppy into his care. The dogs had to spend a month at the vet, where they were a staff favorite because Peep would climb up on Popeye in the kennel they shared and curl up. There, we treated Peep's mange, Popeye's heartworms, and rid the dogs of countless other parasites, fleas and ticks. When he died 6 months later, he died with a recovered coat that had regained some luster, a full stomach, a warm bed, and knowing someone loved him. When Peep's fur grew back, we discovered he was a beautiful golden retriever/sheltie mix. He was a sweet, happy and optimistic companion for many years. We adopted his successor, Wallace, at the local humane shelter, and walks with Wallace make every day better for both of us.",

One way of experiencing this simple but profound principle is by treating dogs and cats with compassion and love.\n\nThen we need to look on our plates and ask ourselves would we kill our dog or cat and eat it, simply because it tastes good?\n\nMost of us would be horrified at that prospect.

A medium-sized terrier mix, he was so emaciated that I could lift him over my head with one arm.  The first three days at the vets were touch and go as he couldn't walk.  One vet thought he had distemper and should be put to sleep.  On the fourth day he stood up and his second life began.   He was such a wounded spirit that he looked like a tired old dog when he wasn't even a year old,   but lots of vet care and food put the weight back on, and  two months of TLC returned his spirit for good.  He turned into a happy, feisty, playful terrier mix who became my rock for the next 14 years.  He loved me more than anyone, and just as much as his thrice-daily walk.  I could do no wrong in his eyes, which made me nervous.   I could tell that I was the world to him, which made me try and do better.  He was the perfect, ultimate companion in every way.   He was the dog personification of joy.  He always wanted my affection, and he was a good listener.  We both \"became\" together.  He died in my arms at the vet clinic just before his 15th birthday.  He was a tremendous gift, and I was so lucky to have him.",

She would bark continually at anything and everything I did, for many months. When she finally stopped that, she would bark continuously at play time, ultimately ending play time permanently as Poochie was totally put off by it. Ultimately, she discovered that I actually understood some of her needs, and would come and purposely bark at me until I addressed them. That was the turning point. No, things did not get better: they got much worse. Having found she had some control over me, she tried to assert authority and take over the house. Although Poochie had been very patient with her constant aggressiveness towards him, he started to bark at her when she would get that pushy with us. She would just get in his face and bark back, essentially telling him to stay out of it. That was enough for my wife too: neither of us liked what Poochie was becoming. After 8 months we found a new home for her, with a single woman who wanted a Shi Tzu. Poochie came to us at 8 weeks old from Cockapoo trainer, and we trained each other. No rescues for us again.",

Something has to be done as it is no different than the ever growing homeless. \n\nI have not heard a single person in the last few years say they bought a dog from a breeder, which is good, but someone must be buying them in mass and loading up shelters with their discards. \n\nThe biggest problem I have with dogs and cats is with the owners who leave locked in a house (or worse in a cage) all day. If your lifestyle does not allow someone to be home with a pet then do not get one. It\u2019s not fair to the animal.",

She has a beautiful voice and a compelling story so I made sure to be in front of my TV for the National Anthem.  Of course I was not equally anticipating a signed performance of the Anthem.  It did not occur to me to think about it or care.\n\nWhen the camera briefly focused on Ms Sun Kim I was instantly mesmerized by the way she seemed to use her entire body to perform.  Then she was gone.  I lingered for a beat or two, wishing the camera had not panned away before any thought of Sun Kim vanished.  I mean vanished.\n\nNot for a single second did it occur to me to think \"What is the point\" -- not as others have offered, \"Why sign if not Spanish or Chinese, or or or\" but \"What is the point of inviting someone to perform the anthem sign language if her performance is not visible on my screen?\"\n\nI take a little (undeserved) pride in the fact that something of the experience remained in the back of my mind which can be the only reason I read Ms Sun Kim's essay which exposed my own lack of awareness and more important, exposed me to the very real issues the deaf confront that I can't see.  And hopefully will serve as a reminder to be mindful that there are walls I don't see experienced daily by Spanish speakers, the Queer community, people experiencing depression or anxiety, or loneliness....",

I do not know ASL, but I am proud to live in a community which makes the effort to include all of its citizens and residents in its activities. I feel proud of America every time I see a disabled person wheeling themselves into a building or entering a public bus which has lowered the entrance step to enable them easy access. All the churches, temples and mosques in the world are no substitute for these acts of genuine grace. What is the value in bickering about it?\n\nWorst case, the NFL and networks made a dumb mistake, they did not think it through, their emphasis is on fake things, why do people jump in and defend it like they were in on the decision-making and know what really transpired. It was a lousy thing they did, whether she is deaf or black or white or whatever, they served her and all of us poorly by showing a lack of thought.",

One could easily suspect this when you began your editorial with a long list of identities, presumably to gather support for all those you feel have been discriminated against.  The Super Bowl represents the pinnacle of lack of discrimination however, as the players are not selected or denied based on their race, religion, ethnicity, political beliefs or sexual preference.  Rather, they are chosen because they are the best at what they do, play football.   Further, the audience attends in order to watch football, not to be subjected to political agendas.

Their loss is as great as the loss of this father, and hero figure.

Both are survived by their mothers.\n\n In between was an an aged slowly ailing and declining family patriarch and another who dealt with metastatic cancer for four years while fiercely living her family life to her fullest until the end.

From age 25 to 32, I lost six family members: all four grandparents, a great-grandmother, and my only uncle. We are a small, close-knit family and those departures left giant holes in my heart. Now in my sixties, I\u2019ve experienced the prolonged decline and eventual passing of my father and the sudden death of my wife\u2019s beloved stepdad.\n\nAlong the way, music has been my lifelong passion. I\u2019ve mourned the passing of many of my favorite musicians: Rory Gallagher (1995), Lonesome Dave Peverett (2000) and Rod Price (2005) of Foghat, Ronnie James Dio (2010), Jon Lord of Deep Purple (2012), B.B. King (2015), Chris Cornell (2017), Tom Petty (2017), Ric Ocasek of the Cars (2019), and Neil Peart of Rush (2020). Some inspired me to not only pick up a guitar at age 14 but to keep on learning, exploring and playing. \n\nAnd yet, after 45 years in the technology space, it never occurs to me to express my sense of loss via social media. \nWhile those performers are important to me, I don\u2019t feel the need to subject my grief to online scrutiny, nor do I want to enter my emotions into what often devolves into a competition (e.g., \u201cMy sadness is just so much deeper than your sadness.\u201d). \n\nInstead, I mourn and grieve in private with my innermost circle of family and friends. It\u2019s a place of trust where we simply honor and respect what each of us may (or may not) feel. Others choose a different path.",

The GOP's involvement, on the other hand, were acts of commission; gerrymandering to gain control of state houses then promoting policies that restricted minority votes so they could gain control of Congress, followed by preventing appointment of liberal (or even moderate) judges and facilitating appointment of conservative federal judges who generally favored their interpretation of the Constitution. These acts were plotted and are much more odious, indeed un-American, that the Dem's lack of attention. This is a critical time for our republic.

Her story put me back on track. \n\nI was reminded of what she did for all of us.  Marie Yovanovitch  is one of the few heroes to emerge from the Trump horror. She put her job and her safety on the line to defy Trump's order not to testify about Ukraine before the House Impeachment Committee. She was the first and others followed. She had to know that her distinguished 33 year career would be over and she still stepped forward and put her country first  to speak truth to power. \n\nWhat an example of courage, duty and honor. And she made a huge difference in building the case against Trump. She inspires me to not allow Trump and his nasty cohorts to force people like me out of this fight. I will follow her lead.

Turning his rhetorical attacks on the free press into action?). Trump alone was reason to vote to our democracy - but it also seemed like we had a crop of genuinely brilliant impassioned people to choose from.\nWarren's thoroughly researched crusade against corruption, Sanders' steadfast focus on the widening wealth and oppportunity gap, Buttigieg's focus on bold systemic reform coupled with his potential to offer an off-ramp to the conflicted center-right, Booker's decency and thoughtfulness, Harris' sharp intelligence... the list goes on and on. The election wouldn't just be about ousting Trump, it would be about choosing the best from a list of inspiring and impressive candidates to fix long term problems.\nBut as I see the primary process full of borderline disinformation (the pro-union Buttigieg is a secret corporate puppet! Sanders is a divisive extremist pushed by an army of trolls!) - it becomes tiring to engage and express a preference. I worry that many are now so dug into their candidate of choice that they're starting to despise the alternatives, and whoever wins faces an uphill battle to unite the left and turn out the vote",

Despite your preferences, see how they would make a difference vs Trump.\n\nWork at reclaiming Congress. This is of equal importance.  Donate to contested Senate races. If you are in a solid blue state, pick a contested race elsewhere (Ballotpedia helps). A small donation of $5 is a vote, too.  Research Congressional, state, and local Blue candidates and inform others about them.  Vote Blue here, too.  It will send a message to the GOP.\n\nDo something local.  Join a get out the Blue vote campaign.  Even if it's just going door to door on your own street.  Or drive people to the polls.  Attend an event for a candidate.

He will lose by a landslide, both in the popular vote and the electoral college.  He will say it was rigged of course, but he will lose.\n\nThe House Democrats will gain seats.  The Senate Republicans will lose both seats and their majority.\n\nA Democrat, once in the White House, will reach out to the Republican Party, but if rebuffed, will govern by Executive Order as Trump has done, and begin to undo the damage he has done during his presidency.\n\nOne final thought to the smug Trumpsters who think their guy will win in November:  get used to hearing \"Lock him up!\" once Trump loses his presidential immunity.

Pompeo likes his job, he gets lots of travel points, so he stands by while a senior US ambassador gets trashed publicly and is removed for standing up to the nonsense.  Trump's White House counsel are in on the scheme to with hold funding according to John Bolton. Finally, Republicans in the Senate go all in on trashing Biden and the conspiracy is complete.

That doesn't mean you've given up, it just means that at that point there's not much else you can do but punt, make a defensive stand and get the ball back in better field position.\n\nI think that is what's happening, in large part. Most of my liberal, progressive friends have conceded that, for the time being, there is nothing that can stop Trump doing whatever he wants. The Republican Senate has basically crowned him king, and no amount of screaming about the injustice is going to change that. Instead, we need to regroup and wait for November. Spend our energy beating him in the election, rather than beating him now.",

And even if he was he could never be nominated. Never. And even if he was nominated there was no way he beat Clinton. No way. Ok, he won but the Mueller investigation will end his Presidency. Right? Shoot Mueller dropped the ball but this will all come crashing down when we impeach. We promise! Oh my God Trump is starting World War 3! Wait scratch that Iran wants to deescalate. Starting to see a trend here? Against all odds Trump always defies expectations. What Trump's adversaries will never be able to grasp is that he's is a political genius. I don't use that word lightly. Nothing else explains his uncanny ability to rebear himself like the mythical Phoenix in crisis after crisis emerging stronger than before. The Dems can rage & shout about his tweets until there's ice on the equator. It won't change the mind of one person who voted for Trump. The more you complain the more he will rub it in your face. Isn't that obvious at this point? What progressives & their co-dependents will never be able to see is that Trump supporters revel in the non-stop drama, are galvanized when he punches back, are delighted when he spits in your face. Far from being embarrassed by his antics, they're thrilled by it & in their heart of hearts can't get enough of it. He's their champion, he's their hero. MSM time to open your eyes.",

Another student, while not specific, expressed concern for Israel as her primary motivation to be \"excited\". Other students became political pioneers; a young woman raised in a Republican family chose to be a Democrat, and a Freshman young man did a lot of reading of history, especially political history, and found his views align with 45. IU and Johnson County are very Democratic. Some of these students experienced ostracism around the family dinner table. I experienced that during the early days of Watergate news reporting by the WP and NPR \"All Things Considered\". (I am still in the family as the \"crazy uncle\" with my \"Resistance\" T-shirts!) Active engagement of the youth gives me hope. We actively worked for a decorated WWII veteran and Senator who did not become President, Senator George  McGovern.

There is a limit to how rapidly brain cells can fire and how long it takes for the to recharge.  About getting hooked on news media, the term itself implies that the process is both addictive and toxic.  Done in moderation, writing, or getting information about politics can be beneficial.  Even enjoyable, if only rarely since 2016.  Trump's response to business failure has been to cut and run, usually stiffing whomever he can.  If he has political failures, his interest will fade quickly enough.  He must be gratified to engage at all.  Trump protects himself by playing golf at a huge cost of taxpayer dollars per weekend for security.  But that's other people's money, so it's his to spend with aplomb.

I have even mentioned this to my doctors. \n\nThe most important plan is to engage where possible:  writing letters, working for local candidates, organizing voter initiatives, doing what you can where you can to be most effective. \n\nAt the same time, while perhaps cutting back somewhat, we can\u2019t afford to relax our guard because this administration is working on so many fronts to distort and change our values. And example: the new travel ban. \n\nI can say that there is nothing more satisfying than working for a local candidate and seeing him/her get elected. I speak from experience.",

To pass progressive legislation and secure favorable judicial appointments, the senate also needs to be overturned, a daunting challenge.  \n\nWinning the Presidency and the Senate will require talking to people who have not already made up their minds, particularly in battleground states, LISTENING carefully to their concerns and aspirations, and engaging in dialogue that helps them consider voting for change.  It also will require getting organized to get people out to vote who too often don't make it to the polls (young people in particular).  Organization and community effort are critical.  The Civil Rights movement succeeded in the south through its base in the churches, but was less successful in areas where community organization was lacking.    \n\nReading the NY Times and posting comments may help if it  brings people together, if it motivates people to get active in ways that build bridges to those who are undecided, and ensures that people who will vote blue get to the polls.  \n\nTrump is a divider who breeds cynicism, dispair and anger.  People who want positive change should be uniters who find common ground with others, raise hopes for a better future and spread good will.  \n\nThe Presidential election can be won with a slim majority if battleground states are won, but progressive change requires changing people's hearts and minds as well, and getting people to the polls.",

The Democrats won the 2018 election nationwide by 9 million votes.  No reason why with demographic drift and widespread mobilization they can't surpass that margin in 2020.  Trump should get no more than 45 percent of the popular vote.  He had 46 percent in 2016 but that number has shrunk over four years with his white elderly constituency checking out at the grave site.\n\nTrump can and should be defeated by a determined and united Democratic Party.  Once that happens, the Trumpists must be exposed, purged and prosecuted where need be.  Further, our reconstituted political order must be reformed to end the imperial presidency.  We need strict ethics boards for anyone running for president in either party.  An ethics board would have rejected Trump in 2015 for numerous reasons, his birtherism being on the top of the list along with his complex and scandalous business history.\n\nLegislation should also be passed to ensure that presidential misconduct on the scales we have seen can be prosecuted while the chief executive is in office.  Obstruction of justice which occurred during the Mueller investigation should be immediate grounds for impeachment or criminal prosecution.  The United States should not have suffer the reckless abuses of power, including violations of the emoluments clause by any future president.",

Well, news flash: It's too late. We who detest Trump have only two options at this point. Live under this dictator and hope he is overthrown, or leave (if we have the means). There are a number of thriving democracies that provide many educational and professional opportunities for their citizens. Time for those of us who can, to begin looking at these.  We owe it to our families, and to our children, to raise them somewhere where they have a future. We who are Americans of color are especially at risk under Trump's regime. We are nothing more than targets, as long as he stays in power.\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that Trump will not be removed by any peaceful means.

And the role didn't even exist prior to 1920!  (The problem didn't arise until McConnell assumed the role because, frankly, I don't think anyone ever contemplated that such an outrageously unscrupulous individual would ever be elected to the Senate.\n\nThe Constitution does not contemplate the existence of political parties at all, let alone a party majority leader who would have such complete control over the business of the Senate as a legislative body, resulting in one individual having untrammeled power to control what comes to a vote before the Senate.

The world has left them behind.  They're working 2+ jobs to stay above water. Their kids, if they went to college, are mired in debt.  But, we've also seen a morphing of the Republican party.  Since Lyndon Johnson sighed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act the Dixiecrats migrated from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.  They took all the retrograde hate with them.  They created and pine for a non-existent history and was largely the creation of television and movies.  At the same time the entertainment industry itself turned its back on democracy.  The most common memes in movies is the \"rule breaking loner\", the Constitution only protects the bad guys, that government itself is evil and corrupt, and that only a single strong leader can save us.  Social media and conspiracy driven outlets like InfoWars pile on and reinforce it too.  The NRA's core meme is you need to be armed against your own government.  Reagan, during his administration said his goal was to shrink government enough so you could drown it in a bath tub.  After 50+ years of that drivel why are we surprised that we have Trump?",

Although Trump has claimed he never met Lev Parnas, Trump said during this dinner, referring to the US Ambassador to the Ukraine at the time, Marie Yovanovitch, \"Get rid of her. Get her out tomorrow. I don\u2019t care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it.\"  If Lev Parnas worked at the State Department, one wouldn't be sure whether Trump was asking for Yovanovitch to be fired from her position.  However, Trump knew that Parnas didn't work at the State Department, so it seems to me that we need to consider whether Trump was ordering a hit on the US Ambassador, similar to what Trump's buddy, Putin, does when he wants to get rid of somebody.    As a result of the Senate not calling witnesses to answer questions about this possible attempted murder, Trump has proven that he literally could \"shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not get in trouble.\"   I realize that Trump might \"only\" ordering someone to get rid of the US Ambassador to the Ukraine, and we don't know whether that would involve shooting or poisoning her, and Trump isn't actually going to shoot somebody himself. Either the Senate or the House need to call witnesses from the State Department to determine whether the sudden recall of the US Ambassador from the Ukraine was to protect her from an imminent assassination ordered by President Trump.",

He would be no threat to anyone once removed, and the country could move on with Mr. Pence, still have time to run a nomination process, still put up a credible Presidential Candidate, and have a nice fresh election with no taint of subversion from our overseas friends.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump will finally learn a lesson or two about what a reputation means, one he missed from his schooldays.  One, that an impeccable reputation will serve you well if you ever find yourself falsely accused of impropriety, because - two, people will give you the benefit of the doubt in times of ignorance of the facts.\n\nFar from the Cherry Tree Cutter who could never tell a lie, we have the Boy Who Cried Wolf.

The Party needs to experience the wrath of the people, and either die or reform. They are clearly on the wrong side of history, but they are fatally blinded by the power they are corruptly abusing. Trump is obviously malign, but he is propped up by R Senators, and to a lesser degree Representatives, so a significant number of them also need to be chastened.\n\nThe impeachment fiasco was the final straw.

Almost nobody in the USA after WWII saw the USSR as exactly a role model for us, but in the propaganda war there was a perceived need to show the Third World that the American way was more attractive than communism. Even if right-wingers resented the power of unions, the civil rights movement, etc., to improve the lives of millions, it was useful to be able to point to the relatively decent standard of living of those millions compared to their counterparts behind the Iron Curtain. The rise of OPEC and related factors (e.g. oil money funding Islamism) upended the bi-polar conflict of the cold war and reduced the need for hypocrisy about inequality. (Recall Nixon's pride in Pat's being a \"cloth coat Republican?\" How quaint.) Vulgar opulence now burnishes the Trump/GOP brand.

There may have been some residual ethical doubts, but the harvest needed to be planted and the crops gathered. \n\nA similar allegory occurs with the recent tax cut, which, by most accounts benefited a very small, very wealthy group of individuals and organization.

The developmentalists describe a frame of mind they variously call warrior, egocentric, impulsive thinking and self-sovereign. This stage is characterized by impulse gratification, little or no empathy and lack of trust. To this mindset, life is a brutal dog-eat-dog fight and one must often use ruthless means to keep control. Trump has much in common with the warrior world view, as we have seen repeatedly from his tweets, interviews, history of sexual predation, tendency to banish members of his inner circle for acts of perceived disloyalty and his drive to maintain presidential power that led to impeachment.\n\nHistorically, the rise of the warrior consciousness brought humanity benefits. But we must recognize warrior consciousness--and those adults who inhabit this stage--as what it is: immature and less advanced. In fact, most reach this stage as children, from about ages 7-10. But many evolve to later stages (including traditional, modern and postmodern--the 3 most common stages in America today), where values like respect for authority, moral regard for others, faith, self-sacrifice and nonviolence are hallmarks. \n\nLet\u2019s hope that with awareness of developmental psychology, that we reach a place where we include the best of each world view, while transcending the detrimental aspects. Ultimately, perhaps we can reach a peaceful end to the culture wars.",

This scheme traveled through the Republican machine, was packaged and sold to the American people through Right Wing Media, and was only stopped at the Supreme Court because the conspiracy was revealed.  This effort took a lot of money, a lot of people, a lot of coordination, a lot of planning - all with the intent to thwart the Constitutionally mandated census of counting everyone residing in the US to determine representation.\n\nThis is just one of many conspiracies enacted by the Republican party to gain and maintain power, all at the behest of the wealthy who provably have benefited from Republican rule (income inequality).  The anger of the rank and file voters was manufactured by the Right which, after killing the Fairness Doctrine, opened the door to all manner of falseness to penetrate deep into the psyche of rural Americans to stir resentment of \"liberals\" who were branded evil and corrupt.  The Right historically was the party of business but remade themselves to appeal to just enough voters to keep themselves in power by manipulating voters' fears and anxieties.",

In it, he argued that many presidents had been accused of abuse of power, including Washington, Lincoln and Obama.  He argued that \"Obstruction of Congress\" was part of the checks and balance built into the constitution, that arguments between the executive and legislative branches were envisioned by the framers of the constitution, and regarded as part of the proper functioning of government.\n\nMany Republicans (but certainly not all) agreed that Trump had done terrible things, but also bought Dershowitz's argument that the articles of impeachment were too general and would result in impeachment becoming commonplace.\n\nFor example, the proper place to argue immigration policy is the House and Senate.  Yet Obama gave amnesty to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants through the Dreamers program, which bypassed Congress.\n\nI believe this action of Obama was a mistake.  What it does is say:  Let's not decide things within Congress but rather by executive order of whoever happens to be president at the time.\n\nCould Democrats not see that this mistake would come back to haunt them?\n\nFor a democracy to function we need a national discussion on immigration.",

And the billionaire class magnificently exploits this racism by talking about makers and takers, entitlement reform, Obamacare, immigrants, terrorism, religious freedom, Second Amendment, etc., all while creating a new Gilded Age that has created extremes of income inequality unseen in a century.\n\nAnd, of course, that income inequality is what really creates the economic and social conditions which mire white Americans, poor and working class, in their misery.\n\nThe last stanza of Langston Hughes' poem 'Let America Be America Again' seems apt:\n\nOut of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,\nThe rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,\nWe, the people, must redeem\nThe land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.\nThe mountains and the endless plain \u2014\nAll, all the stretch of these great green states \u2014\nAnd make America again!",

In 1968 the news including tv were going on how it would be the last election with the Electoral College since Wallace won in several states. Nothing happened to lazy to change it. In 2000 Al Gore more votes and because of Sandra Day O'Connor vote George Bush became President with Dick Cheney and the lies and the illegal invasion of Iraq and how has that worked out. The massive tax cuts for the rich and the Crash of 08. The Democrats allowing Moscow Mitch to not allow a nomination for Chief Justice to be brought forward. The court has been packed by Republicans and America is lost face facts. In 2016 Hillary gets three million more votes and loses. Nothing is being done.. So my prediction Trump will get six to seven million less votes and still become the President and lets stop kidding ourselves I lived in NYC and know the scum of the Trump family he is a gangster and one that runs the country now. He will unleash the venom and vile policies never seen and who will stop him. In other nations people revolt in America the run out and buy another tv to show reality shows. If there were any guts the Blue states would vote to seperate what is to stop them there according to Allan no Constitution.

They will simply start telling Washington that they are going to do things their own way.\n\nThis will lead to further disintegration of the already fragile bonds between regions of this country. It will also lead to even less willingness on a national scale to address our society's problems. The end result will be the loss of American dominance on the world stage. This will take a few decades, but my mid-century it will be complete.\n\nAll of that has been accelerated by the rise of autocracy in the White House and the utter ineptitude of Congress and refusal of the courts to address it. We are watching, in real-time, the rise of an authoritarian government. We are watching, in real-time, the demise of political ideals and traditions that have animated this country for 244 years. We are watching, in real-time, the overt abandonment of basic principles of renaissance thinking - that facts matter, that law should apply equally, that there is such a thing as the public interest.\n\nThe United States of America, as we have known it for all of our lives, is in its death throes.

His lies protect him, his wealth protects him, his enormous ego protects him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He lacks the knowledge of the machinations of anything beyond the world of real estate and influential power of the uber wealth. To enter the world of politics he needed mentors and shills. He has no particularly complex understanding of anything so he relies on others. For all his bravado he really lacks\u00a0 self-esteem. He needs to be surrounded by people who will stroke his ego, assure him he is right. Putin knew that way back in the 80s. McConnell knows this. Trump is the perfect patsy for those who know that power does not necessarily lie in those who sit on the throne but rather in those who whisper into the ears and pull the strings from the shadows.\u00a0\n\n\n\n.",

His continued abuse of office revealed Trump -- as if there was any question from the beginning-- as a bloody cheater, a repeat offender, and a threat to national security.\n\nBut Republicans don't know the facts. All they know are conspiracy theories invented on Fox News. For example, the day  the FBI decided that Hillary Clinton did not commit a crime, Fox News spent the whole day speculating that the FBI was corrupt -- and that was the \"news\" division. On Fox the only people who are doing anything wrong are Democrats, and Republicans are God's only children. It's a Republican ad campaign running 24/7. \n\nHow can this country survive with such a divide between Democrats and Republicans who think Fox News is \"news\"?",

If so, one side has most of the artillery, and I'm not talking about the Dems. \n\nSeriously, even if a Dem unseats Trump, as things stand, we're still at an impasse.

Hence, racists and bigots flocked to his campaign.\nWhen he calls immigrants an invasion and now Democrats implicitly accept that view with their plans for \"border security,\" this is due to a large group of voters who are anti-immigrant bigots. Unlike Archie Bunker who simply mouthed off, with Democracy and the Rule of Law, Trump is imposing his racism and bigotry.\nWhile proponents of democracy would have us believe that the best would rise to the top, that's not always true. For instance, a slave-owning white supremacist was the first president. People such as Johnson and Nixon perpetrated a holocaust in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. This was popular until the draft and increasing American deaths turned public opinion.\nRacist organizations are of course illegitimate. Hence the failure to impeach Trump, who has the support of nine out of ten Republicans, shows that Democracy produces racist government when you have a racist and bigoted electorate. The proponents of Democracy might want to examine reality before selling us their morally repugnant ideology.",

And now, thanks to his feckless (and I believe doomed) party, he's momentarily empowered to debase his office more than any previous moment in his presidency. \nBefore I write the next sentence, I'll qualify it with this: Vote. I think he'll destroy any chance he has, leading up to the election in November. It may be large or petty, but it will be the last straw. He's going down, with prejudice. He is beyond careless and widely despised now, but it's not enough for him, let's face it. As it stands in America in 2020 there is no ambivalence, no tacit acceptance surrounding Donald Trump. You're either a stubborn cultist or you understand, perhaps more than any time in history, this person must be a one-term president, period, end of embarrassing story. Surely he'll find the need to put a cherry on those feelings. VOTE.",

I understand how ridiculous it seemed at the time to raise that kind of behavior to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. But think about what excusing that behavior has led to. The whole tenor of the 2000 election would have changed and we might not have ended up with (what we can now call) the second-worst president in history, which in turn paved the way for the worst president. We would have shown that bad presidential misbehavior has consequences, and even more important, that bad male behavior has consequences. Think of all the horrible things that have happened in the last twenty years that might have been avoided had Bush not been president or had the culture shifted in such a way that would have put the Weinsteins and Epsteins of the world on notice. \n\nOne thing is for sure in this alternate timeline: it couldn\u2019t possibly be any worse than the one we\u2019re living in.",

The bulk of the corporate and personal super rich back Trump because he gave them a trillion dollar tax cut.  The white evangelist leadership back Trump imprisoning immigrant children because he supports more tax cuts for their churches and more executive orders obliterating the separation of church and state.  White nationalists support Trump because he's made it clear through policies and public statements that he believes whites are superior and should be given special privileges (largely through permitting \"states rights\" to institute massive voter disqualification and refusing to acknowledge hate crimes against minorities).

What makes his brand of mental illness effective is that he is a pathological liar who shrouds his lies with (often fake) claims of success as a businessman and he looks and plays the part well.  He has none of the concern or remorse about being wrong that constrains normal people.  So people inclined to embrace his fantasy world, which is often nothing but a series of paranoid delusions about people trying to keep him honest, see him as a \"leader\" and \"heroic.\"  They embrace the Trump fantasy world the way they rush to movies about heroes with supernatural powers.  He makes them feel good.  And up to now they have not had to live with the consequences of the lies/delusions.  \n\nMost people who work at senior levels of government/journalism/academia/science, lines of work where being right actually counts for something, lines of work in which you will be fired if you lie or are consistently wrong, are of course appalled by the dishonesty. \n\nTrump does what he does because he is mentally ill -- impulsive, narcissistic, delusional.

These are: the perception that our government is, for the most part, irredeemably corrupt; a rejection of orthodoxy in politics; and, notably, the most personally active US president in history. \n\nIt is interesting that for nearly the same reasons, Jesus Christ was extremely appealing to the Roman world. For example, JC promised to \"restore his father's house\" which sounds like a MAGA promise. He promised a new world order to the exclusion of all that came before, much like Trump has done when he proclaimed that he would \"drain the swamp\". Finally, JC offered a personal relationship with his followers, something the president has also done quite effectively through extensive engagement online, at rallies, and on Fox News.\n\nBut I'm not suggesting that the president is like Jesus Christ nor even the anti-Christ, only that he derives loyalty from his base using JC's playbook. Today's disenfranchised voters seek not only a new leadership paradigm but also a personal relationship with their leader, not some faceless Frankenstein president stitched together from special interests and focus group studies.\n\nBut is he the Chosen One? Apparently his base thinks so.",

When they did not have the necessary votes they changed the rules with the help of the conservative MPs, e.g. counting the communist MPs, who were apprehended before, as present. In the end all conservative MPs approved the act, some upon vague promises by the Nazis, which were naturally all broken. The only ones who resisted were the Social Democrats. Their chairman famously stated \"You may take our freedon or our lives but not our honour\". And erverybody knows how history went on from this moment.\nI can only hope that the American people shows more backbone than we Germans at that time and hold the cowardice senators accountable for their act and throw them out coming November.

By testing, testing, prodding, feeling for weaknesses, he's like a relentless animal, finding his limits (hint: there have been none) and wearing his opposition down by attrition.\n\nOf course, first he had to cultivate that base of his, which he's wielded like the sword of Damocles over the members of his party.  Likely to his great surprise, they all caved, proving to anyone who doubted it that the party abandoned its principles decades ago.\n\nHis grip on is party, and now on all of us, is as tight as it can be.  The question is, can he ever be stopped?\n\nI have to confess, for an evil tyrant, he's the last person I would have expected a political party to protect: ignorant, amoral, self-indulgent, and utterly without scruples. For McConnell, he's been a vehicle to power, a person to tolerate so long as he delivers.\n\nThe central question is, can he keep on delivering or will he, in Trumplike fashion, be his own worst enemy?\n\nWe can only hope and pray.",

We should be present in every state where a Republican senator is up for re-election reminding the electorate that the incumbent senator, living off public dollars, refuses her/his responsibility to be an independent branch of government. We should pin every single one of them to Trump's actions and assume they are doing the same thing: foreign collusion, profiting off their names and positions, blocking opportunity and voting rights for black and brown people, all of it. We should assume this is their view of government and how they intend to govern. And we should question them about this publicly over and over again, in the same vein that Republicans chanted \"the emails, the emails, the emails,\" in 2016. The American memory is short, and it is critical that we use this moment to shine a light on the character of our Republic senators: corrupt, sycophantic, racist, and parasitic, living off the public dime while swearing to see no evil, hear no evil. Take the gaze off of Iowa for one week, and instruct the nation. It matters not who wins the presidency if these corrupt senators retain their seats.",

William Barr, our top legal official, has for decades pursued the notion of the \"unitary executive.\" Donald Trump has shown us what that looks like: the President can do not wrong. Today's Republican Party finds that model attractive because since 1932 the Republicans have controlled both houses of Congress for only 18 years and have also held the presidency for only 10 of those years, BUT they have held the presidency in 40 of those years. Congress is not the friend of the wealthy, but a Trump-style presidency can be..Senate Republicans stood up for that \"President-can-do-anything\" model by crafting the impeachment debate in those terms and confirming them with their votes. \nWill any future president yield back that power?",

Few of them (none of them?) are as ugly in spirit as Don Trump. That's the good news.\n\nThe bad news? A lot of people actually like and admire Don Trump because of his transgressive spirit. But before we cast aspersions on those people because they love a selfish guy who breaks social norms, we should recognize that many artists and scientists and entrepreneurs loved by liberals and never-Trumpers could be described that same way. So, the transgression of social norms isn't the problem.   \n\nNo. Don Trump isn't awful because he breaks rules and ignores social niceties, he's awful because of his cruelty and utter lack of regard for others. Fame and wealth didn't make him that way. Something else warped and polluted his spirit. \n\nMy explanation? He's a Dementor from Harry Potter come to life.",

Did I grossly overestimate people on the right?  Did the American right deteriorate rapidly?\n\nMy best conjecture is that it's both.  First, I think the anti-liberal propaganda apparatus (Fox News, Limbaugh, etc.) has been softening them up for decades now, essentially turning their brains to mush (at least in the political realm).  Second, for them to be open to someone like Donald Trump, to actually believe the things I know they believe, means there is something about human nature that I didn't understand before.  I do now, however.  It's not a pretty picture.  20th century fascism always seemed so incomprehensible to me before.  Not any longer.",

These people are tired of feuding and dishonest politicians. Some honest politicians maybe but not enough of them. Trump filled the gap but his crassness and venal dishonesty wasn\u2019t apparent to most voters who shooed him in! \n\nThe state going all out to help it\u2019s citizenry to meet basic needs isn\u2019t socialism! Canada, our closest neighbour, the UK, nor France, Germany, & Spain; they aren\u2019t socialist! They\u2019re just compassionate societies.

Democrats understand the reality, but I'm not sure that every day republican are capable of discerning fact from fiction.  The ruling republicans know all the things to do and say to keep the believers in line.  We are living in a period where facts and reality are a matter of opinion.

At worst, what was once a Constitutional democracy will have been so thoroughly eroded that what will emerge from the chaos of this Reign of Terror will be broken beyond repair and future generations will only know life in the Banana Republic of America.",

They don't care that he's a liar, a bigot, and a supporter of Russian Communism.

Trump is mentally ill, and it makes me wonder what state of mind one would need to be in to support his lunacy.",

This paranoia has always been there, but only Trump decided to defy convention and go where others would not.  We can go down the list of every other domestic issue all we want, but unless we also realize there is a yearning out there to put an end to illegal immigration, we are working at a tremendous disadvantage with regard to white voters.  We scratch our heads wondering how our neighbors, who we know to be good people, could support such an unqualified renegade... this is a substantial part of the answer.\n\nI urge our Democratic candidates to offer a strong policy on immigration reform along the lines of the Senate compromise of a few years ago.

In my teens I began to read The NY Times and the New York Post as well. At 82 of age, I read the Times, Washington Post, and Baltimore Sun online. Stay clear of social media, and restrict TV news to NPR and BBC. When I meet up for coffee with my friends we exchange views which keeps all very current. Book reviews in the Times and Washington Post help me look for what is worth reading. I am concerned that young people are getting nonsense instead of news.

The New Right, especially over the last several decades funded by the Koch Brothers, has been trying to use the Republican Party to undermine democracy. They have paid to train lawyers and judges that the Executive Branch is supreme and then they have tried to pack the courts at all levels with these lawyers and judges. The New Right arose in the late 1960s after Johnson's 1964 election made them fear that the Democratic Party that was becoming increasingly liberal on civil rights could win without the South, so they began to organize to turn the country back from liberalism. The Koch were initially libertarian members of the John Birch Society, but after Reagan's election, they turned to electoral politics and have accelerated the already existing \"new conservative\" movement. The goal is to undermine democracy by promoting the Unitary Executive theory indeed that the president can do anything as long as they can guarantee that they will win presidential elections. And they back it up with conservatives in control of the courts. The goal is to reduce the power of Congress (the will of the people) from voting them out or passing legislation to support civil rights, labor rights, and human rights. Trump furthers that goal.",

Sugarcoating by telling stories without going deep down to the root cause.\n\nI don\u2019t want to live in a country where anarchy is sold to me as the arch democracy every single day of my life in form of the putrid American rhetoric.\nThat is why I am voting for Bernie Sanders.  He will do his best to bring us to the 21st Century social democracy where indeed every one goes to bed indifferent of who they will wake up as.  That is what John Rawls taught me in his 1971 book: A Theory of Justice.",

Here it is: \n\nI wonder if JP share's Trump's view of the world as a simple place populated by potential opponents and attackers who must be attacked and destroyed. It's an approach that's principally driven by fear, rage and arrogance. \n\nThere's a fear of being destroyed that arises from the staggeringly limited  view that all interactions with other people or nations are potential or actual  threats, and are zero-sum. When one gains, the other loses. \n\nFaced with that threat, the parties involved--including Trump and his supporters--respond with anger, and all too often, rage. How dare those \"others,\" whoever they might be, take their goods, money or honor? The anger or rage makes them feel powerful, and more easily led. Trump takes his soft hand off a golf club and points, and they move in his direction.\n\nFinally, the presence of a perceived existential threat drives an arrogance that justifies any direction or action that's taken. Denying other Americans the right to vote, forcing them to agree to Trump supporters' religious principles and shoving brown-skinned children into cages are all justified the moment they are conceived. Hey, he's a fighter, so any blood on the ground, however innocent, is just part of him being him.",

The theory was that without racial and sexual bigotry in our daily language, we as a people would learn to work as one.  Instead, something the people from the Northeast are familiar with, PC has not eliminated hatred between sexual and racial parties, it has simply made it go underground.  Hence, when someone makes their opinions publicly known, they are applauded and embraced.  This is not the way many of us were brought up.  By the way, there were many college classmates of mine who came from NYC and Long Island NY.  I can honestly say that many of them, were it not for their accents, could easily be mistaken as southerners based on their expressed racial opinions that were verbally expressed in the deep south during the 1960's.  Therefore I am not surprised at anything that comes out from DJT's mouth.  I am disappointed in the Congressional Delegations which find these statements and the underlying hate acceptable/defensible via their deeds as our elected representatives.

They venerate the market.  So they have been instrumental in reducing regulations, in cutting taxes, in getting rid of the draft, in weakening almost all collective efforts to make the country more equal economically and politically.  The most important of these economists was Prof. Milton Friedman, whose views held sway from  1980  till 2008.\n\nThey have made a lucky few incredibly wealthy, especially in the financial and managerial sectors, leaving the rest with stagnant or failing wages.  They have made it harder for poor people to enter the middle class, and they have increased the gap in life-spans between the rich and the poor on average to more than 13 years.\n\nEconomics is at best a proto-science.

The GOP knew this, it is why they fought for so many years the expansion of the executive powers, they feared exactly this.\n\nThe real answer is that Trump's lawlessness benefits them, it plays into their base's notion that the US needs a \"tough guy\" to get the job done, and if he breaks the rules, well, to make an omelet you gotta crack some eggs.  Conservatives love to blame liberals, how court decisions and the 'liberalization' of America led to this, but that is a lie, that liberalization happened through the rule of law and respect for it.\n\nThe really scary part about this is the GOP has now created a Supreme Court with conservative judges who see not the law, but their duty to their party. What happens when SCOTUS rules, tries to turn back the clock, and people stop recognizing SCOTUS decisions? They could do this, and like with Trump, who is going to enforce them?

After almost 250 years the US still is grappling with white supremacy. Whether it is manifested as slavery, racial segregation, or racial discrimination the US cannot get beyond white supremacy.

Based on his power and following in FOX News and the Republican party, there's no reason for him to settle for less.\n\nHe is out to destroy democratic self-government. It's just that simple. If we fail to see that now, he will succeed.",

He has been swallowed whole by the lies he tells about himself. This, of course, is the ordinary fate of persistent liars, they lose touch with reality and become the lie. Trapped, there is no way out, no means to escape the cocoon of imagined greatness in which Trump dwells. The only path is to have others confirm his greatness.\n\nOther is Trump's colossal ignorance along with his adamant refusal to learn.

That was one reason Christie was fired right before the inauguration: he insisted the task was big and complicated.\n\nWere Republican senators so blind to these facts and the need to protect the country?

What we have, at the least, is a president who wants to be an autocrat and over 40% of the population, concentrated in the party with the most power, who want that also.

I'm not here to judge him by any means, but his overall actions tend to get him into trouble of varying degrees sometimes. Of course being a member of the general public, we will never truly know the entire workings of what goes on in the federal government.

But in our \"democracy\" the Electoral College favors small, sparsely populated states, making it possible for a less popular candidate to become president (e.g. George W. Bush in 2000, Trump in 2016). The historical reason for this weird system is that in order for the 13 colonies to form the USA, there needed to be an electoral formula that both slave and non-slave states could agree on. Some historians might quibble, but that is the essence of it.\n\nThe GOP now controls the Senate, an undemocratic institution in a way similar to the Electoral College (2 Senators from CA, 2 from WY). As long as our senators respected certain traditions and behaved honorably, the Senate gave useful gravitas to our political system. \n\nBut, knowing their days in power were numbered, Trump's GOP decided not to modernize and improve our Constitution, but simply to ditch it and assume absolute power.\n\nElsewhere this is known as a \"coup d'etat\".\n\nNow, it has happened to us.",

What did the colonists overthrow King George for, anyway?\n\nIn a properly working democracy, there would be better correctives to our inequality trend.   The high court in effect gave a green light to shrinking the govt we elect to represent and protect us.  After a while, Trump-type swamp creatures responded, rising from the depths. \n\nAny columnist analyzing rising inequality and the trend to authoritarianism must write about the 10th Anniversary of Citizens United, and how it dis-united the U.S.\n\nTell how most citizens of both parties want to reverse Citizens United to free America from big money dominance. Big story.\n\nCould Leonhardt say what in our past political culture and traditions has let big money dominance to be seen as legitimate in a democracy?",

The casino business DID collapse, it was the only publicly traded corporation Trump ever headed and it lost almost one billion dollars in stock market value. If that ain't a collapse, I don't know what it is.\n\nTrump was forced to sell his private yacht following the first round of casino failure and he was put on a strict living allowance of $400,000 (per month). Later, he was FIRED! as CEO. (note: I am relying on memory in regard to these facts but I am sure they are generally correct.)\n\nThe reason the casinos failed was that D.J. Trump promised something they could not be achieved: they would need to generate profits (called \"the take) of one million dollars per day to have any hope of paying off the loans/bonds that were issued to pay for the building of this shaky \"empire\".\n\nThis is also Trump's standard operating procedure: take out the biggest loans you can get, try to do something that seems \"spectacular\", \"like no one could believe\", then, when trouble starts, re-negotiate.

Throughout his life, Trump has tried to do this through the deployment of money.  He now has the government at his disposal as well.  And the GOP is fine with that, since they can relate to the impulse.",

How can you not understand that Biden did nothing to stop his son from taking a job with a gas company in Ukraine. Hunter was hired for ONE reason,his father was Vice President of the United States. Biden then went on a trip with his son Hunter to China and while there Hunter secured a deal for an investment that in the future will reap him millions. This attitude that I have done nothing wrong if alike to laughing at the American people for being so stupid. Biden is as phony as a five dollar bill. With that don\u2019t go there attitude when questions arrive. You just do not do things like that when your VicePresident of the United States. You tell your son this is ridiculous and you stare it public ally if he doesn\u2019t listen. The American people have no shame backing Biden and on the other side Trump. Where are the thinking people of this nation. You don\u2019t need an education to see what\u2019s going on. To rescue us from this dilemma I recommend a serious look at a practical man.Mr Bloomberg,who started with 0 and has a great track record bringing smart people together to solve problems. Stop with this America political theater of jokes and shame about our candidates and form option on facts. If Trump remains president the Debt being created buy consumers and corporations will cause a deep recession in a couple of years unless we put on some brakes.

He said he\u2019d run as a Democrat for Senator if we supported him in 2016. He lied. I don\u2019t trust either him or his wife (of family) with money. His campaign used some unethical methods in 2016. Like using pictures of popular people in their literature without their consent in a presumption of an endorsement. There were & still are complaints of sexual harassment in the campaigns. I vetted him well in 2016 and came up with some shady things. No matter what you think of Clinton, I do not approve of the way the Bernie Bros treated her or, especially her supporters. There were threats. I don\u2019t think, when it comes down to it, that Bernie, or his supporters are Democrats at all. They are just taking advantage of the existence of a well organized political party. That is when they aren\u2019t criticizing everything about it. I had to hear, for the umpteenth time, on social media, about how unfair the DNC was to Bernie in 2016. But when I politely asked what exactly did they do in their policies to hurt him and give an unfair advantage to Clinton, no one could even give me an answer. I\u2019m sick of Sanders!",

His candidacy is weak, with bar far the biggest baggage of any democratic candidate.\n\nBut, Franklin Bruni is right. There is a demand by a large chunk of the American people for a return to normalcy, a yearning for taking a breath, particularly among older Americans. A sense of returning to deeply held values that have been turned upside down under Trump. We will find out soon enough.\n\nIf Biden makes it, and if he wants to win, he must unite the base he does not hhave and rally the progressive wing and the younger vote, without which he will not win.

Bloomberg's team immediately shot back about Trump's fake hair, sprayed tan, and lying about his obesity. Anyone who thinks this doesn't bother Trump, doesn't know what it takes to beat Trump. Trump is extremely weak and cannot handle this kind of criticism.\n\nThis display from Bloomberg's campaign is a signal he is willing to go and kick Trump's behind. If that means fighting fire with fire, so be it.\n\nI can get behind that approach 56 billion %.

Centrism, trying to get along with everyone, is what got us Trump. Wasn't that Obama's mantra? After the past 12 years, it seems incredibly self-defeating and cowardly. The farther right the GOP goes, the farther in its direction the Dems are pulled, in the vain hope that the right wing will compromise. Don't people get it by now? The right will never compromise. If you give 'em an inch, they'll take a mile. That's why I find it inspiring to hear candidates like Sanders and Warren and AOC who are willing to frame the debate and move the Overton window - not wait for the right to stake a position and then just react, trying vainly to pull us back to some imagined \"center\". I get that Biden's persona is as a blue-collar type of guy, but it's just a persona. The bankruptcy law he championed hurt working people, and the Obama administration he was part of ended up doing the bidding of the big banks while failing to give needed relief to those hurt by them.

Yes, he focuses on revolution, and he energizes people by pointing out the injustices of our current political system, but the campaign's slogan is \"not me, us.\"  To say that Sanders is \"fighting fire with fire\" is to ignore the empathetic and compassionate basis for his policy.  Not only is Bernie asking people to come together, but he is asking them to look out for one another.  As opposed to Biden, who has a history of doing what he can to be liked, Sanders has a long history of looking out for underprivileged, unpopular, and underrepresented people.  Is there anything kinder than that?",

They have agreed to harsh and racist criminal justice policies, tax cuts on the obscenely wealthy, failed in 2008 to hold Wall St responsible while supporting austerity policies that hurt the majority of this country and turned a blind eye to climate change while offering a watered down health care solution.

Rising economic inequality, wage stagnation, entrenched education disparities, a decimated faith in the power of government, drug dependencies induced by economic collapse, are all very, very real and have nothing to do with one's soul or character.\n\nTo quote the rapper Mos Def, \"There's hunger in the street that is hard to defeat. Many steal for sport, but more steal to eat.\"\n\nBiden's campaign, erroneously in my opinion, elevates character as the highest priority for voters. However, it was Donald Trump who signed the First Step Act, It was Donald Trump who signed the tax cuts into law. Love it or hate it, those two examples enabled a lot of people to line their pockets and some to be free, all while his admin. put kids in cages - character be damned, so long as you get your piece. \n\nJoe needs more. America needs more. Or, dare I say, America just needs a different candidate for President.",

I've sadly come to the conclusion that it doesn't matter.  Just this morning interviews of Trump supporters in IA confirmed that fear.  It's all about the economy yada yada yada.  And - they warn that - like in 2016 - people will lie to pollsters and vote for the criminal in chief without admitting it.\n\nSo, sorry Joe  -  \"appealing to our better angels\" was a failure in 2016 and will fail in 2020 - especially when your old Senate buds stand ready to smear you (Lindsey Graham).\n\nWhat I suggest is turning toward Trump's incompetence and clear mental incapacity.   The man is simply an idiot who is still scamming the right people in the right states who enjoy outsize electoral influence thanks to the EC and the Senate.\n\nSomeone needs to make the case that Trump is a  FRAUD because there are still intelligent sounding people who think this guy knows what he's doing other than when he is committing crimes.",

I watch documentaries and read accounts: the rising  homelessness in major cities. I am surprised. Some folk working in places like Disney World Florida, living in their cars because they can't afford rent. A C-Span video  where a California Congresswoman  Katie Somebody, confronted a Bank CEO earning $ 32 million p.a. a Jamie Something, with the budgetary constraints of hypothetical single mothers doing low wage jobs in the bank, ending in the red at each month's end. He seemed clueless as to what the solution might be. The list goes on. Everyday I learn that 'the shining city on the hill', is beginning to resemble my homeland. It seems the working poor, doing 2-3 minimum wage jobs, simply don't have the time/energy to write letters to NYT about their precarious lives and the perilous futures for their kids in public schools, many getting a low-value education ... again reminding me sadly of the appalling gap in the 2 tier school system here. Maybe free health care is a real issue. Maybe student debt, if their kids get as far as college, is a real issue. Maybe the high cost of medicines is a real issue. Maybe higher minimum wage is a real issue. Maybe candidates fighting for them are also caring, kind, humane, sympathetic?",

I'll try to be clear and concise about my point of view. In 2008 we elected Obama as the \"hope & change\" president. Many of us were justifiably disappointed in the outcome of both his terms in office. We found that no drama translated into a lack of forcefulness in his leadership and an unwillingness to engage with and push back against a determined opposition. So I for one am not looking for a nice guy / gal. I'm looking for someone with the pugnacity to take on the Trump republicans in a way that both gets their attention and forces a level of grudging respect. Then perhaps we can see about working together & actual compromise not the capitulation that often passed for it in the Obama years.\n\nWho passes for that person I leave to your consideration and judgement. Just do us all a favor and vote for the nominee regardless of who it is. No passes this time, no third party votes out of \"conscience\", no sulking because your \"choice\" didn't win. Yep even Sanders, Biden or Bloomberg is better than 4 more years of Trumpism. ABT!!!!!",

I'm concerned that some other candidates may be too rigid and committed to their agendas.",

Republicans weren't interested with Obama and won't be with Biden.)  Bruni may find reassurance, but most voters find Biden, well... boring.  \"Unimpressive,\" \"palpably diminished energy,\" meandering sentences is soporific.  \nHonesty and decency?  Bruni admits Biden's lack on all kinds of issues, like SS, choosing the insurance companies who funded his campaigns over bankrupt working people, a war on crime that incarcerated a generation of young blacks.)  \nConsistency, honesty, decency? That's Bernie Sanders', decades of espousing the same humane values.  I love Elizabeth Warren's values and programs (I bought 4 of her teeshirts); but she lacks  the charisma to energize and turn out the voters. (EW for VP!)

This choice will turn the tables on partisanship and validate the 2016 iconoclastic Trump voter view that \"Washington\" is dysfunctional as opposed to only Republicans. \n\n- Or hand Trump a major bipartisan victory right before the election and take wind out of the Democratic nominee's sails, effectively making Trump look like a normal president who works with both sides.\n\nJoe Biden, tied to Obama's legacy, would be the worst candidate to face this scenario. \n\nThe only way we can avoid this disaster is by running with universal healthcare and trusting enough support from the center will hold for this pitch to the struggling heartland people to succeed.",

His basic position was Trudeau is terrible and Trump is great and he wanted me to agree with him.  I didn\u2019t.  Then he started with Biden conspiracy theories.  That\u2019s why I think this story is relevant to this article. He was all in on the whole Hunter Biden conspiracy, then he said something like, how many of your tax dollars paid Hunter Biden? I said, none.  He said it was some ridiculous amount, over a billion dollars.  I said, that\u2019s not true, and now you are getting into conspiracy theories with no basis in fact.  Those were my exact words.  It was really awkward.  The whole time, my wife, his wife, and I were saying let it go, let\u2019s not talk about politics.  But he insisted. It reminded me of my brother in law from south London who also insisted we knew how much he loves Trump.  God I\u2019m sick of it.  It goes beyond our borders, which is especially sickening.",

However, to go back with Biden to the way it was before Trump would be to go back to the way it was that gave us Trump. We as a nation gave us Trump and \u201cwe\u201d are responsible for this. And so as a nation with Biden next, the \u201cpendulum\u201d swings back and forth, likely yielding mounting incivility with successive presidents that frustrates progress that the nation ... and from that the world ... benefits by. Setting aside Biden\u2019s age (which actually may be a problem in his particular case), there is nothing wrong with his compassionate pitch; though if rooted in nostalgia and sentimentality, ie, \u201ccheap grace,\u201d it\u2019ll only increase the range of \u201cpendulum\u201d swing. Biden represents huge change from the miserable experience we have under Trump, but a change that stagnates in more cyclic exchange ... and so more division and national unrest.

The Republicans have played up the sense of scandal around Hunter Biden as a means of justifying Trump's call for a sham investigation in order to cheat his way into office once again. I hope it is not the case that Biden's drop in polling numbers indicates that he is now seen by the uninformed (or misinformed) as being tainted by a nebulous aura of unsubstantiated guilt, just as Hilary Clinton quite unfairly was in 2016. Those who passively absorb popular media and neglect to bother with facts and details are especially vulnerable to this kind of manipulation. I like Joe Biden. Despite disagreeing with some of his past decisions, I feel he would make a good solid president and would restore and stabilize American democracy. Being a nice, intelligent person with considerable experience makes him a strong candidate, and since most of the candidates have identical priorities, personality and demeanor may be quite important considerations. Also, he has said he will run with a woman, and will serve for only one term. He may be America's best hope for a female president in four more years.",

He was warm and friendly and was genuinely interested in the people.  To be honest, I wish President Trump had some of his qualities and I say this as a Trump supporter.\n\nJoe Biden has changed some of his previous positions because they did not suit his party\u2019s swing leftward.  He used to support the Hyde Amendment but no longer does.  He is not a true moderate.  \n\nHe also at times seems to be confused and his speech is incoherent.  He gets his facts confused snd sometimes rambles on.  This may be due to his age which could be a problem.  He does not appear to be as sharp as he once was.  This behavior will only increase with his advanced age.  \n\nPresident Trump is rough around the ages but he does get things done.  His policies are what many people like about him.  He has promised and delivered.  This is why people supported him and will do so again in 2020.",

But one that can face down their opponent effectively. All the candidates have character and strengths. Admirable and necessary though the goals of Sanders or Warren may be, they are likely to create turmoil when what people want/need is stability for the next four years, not whiplash about turns that widen the divide. Mature consideration of what is needed yet also what, practically, can be achieved. Building bridges across the widening divide, and then measured bipartisan changes to heal the wounds - probably in a second term.  This needs the long view. So, someone who can provide stability as well as vision - and come through what will be an unusually draining and dirty campaign. With the choice of Vice presidential teaming being almost as critical for success as themselves.  Maybe daft or dreaming but Biden and Warren or Biden and Buttigieg?",

The number of uninsured went up slightly in 2019 but for the last 5 years it has been going down.  More Americans have health, dental, and vision insurance than ever before.  Since 2016, the wealth of the bottom 50% of American households increased by 47% (WSJ).\n\nYes, some people struggle but how can Sanders win running for people who have no reason to support him?  \n\nSanders takes complex problems-high drug prices-finds a villain (Pharma) and then proposes government takeovers.  \n\nHe exaggerates other problems beyond recognition.  Every debate he says there are 87 million uninsured and underinsured Americans.  There are roughly 20 million uninsured (many of whom can purchase subsidized insurance when they want) and according to federal law mandating minimum insurance no underinsured.  His solution is to eliminate private insurance.  A devastating policy for those who are insured, work for insurance companies, or hold these companies in their portfolio.\n\nThe system is rigged for others?  He owns 3 houses, the 3rd bought with federal money his wife made running a college into bankruptcy.\n\nConversely, Biden can win. He isn't finding boogeymen and has international experience.

Unlike the next two primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina, Iowa \"is\" one those half-dozen swing-states and perhaps the best early indicator of what it will take to beat Trump and most important, where that battle will take place.\n\nBy and large, in the presidential election the coasts will vote for a Democrat.  But the swing-states are were the 2020 elections will be won.  And here I believe that Biden provides fence-sitting voters with the most appealing option to Trump.\n\nSanders and Warren currently share the same base of democratic primary voters averaging around 40%.  Early on it was about an even split but in the past month, Warren is down about 10% while Sanders is up 10%.  No surprise.  If Warren slips further or drops out, simple math indicates that Warren's supporters will lean toward Bernie.  But just like Trump who can't breakout from a 40+% base of support, neither can Bernie.  It is his ceiling.\n\nThe other 60% of primary voters are still split with Biden owning at least a third of this percentage.  But he will soon face a more head-to-head challenger; Bloomberg.\n\nEarly on, I felt that a Biden/Buttigieg ticket had legs. Now I believe that the best possible ticket is Biden/Bloomberg.

Kennedy, therefore, felt it necessary to state his beliefs regards separation of church and state, because the Roman church represents a church/state. So he went down to Houston in September of 1960 and said these words: \"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute, where no Catholic prelate would tell the President, should he be Catholic, how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners whom to vote for; where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference. I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish, where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source, where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials, and where religious liberty is so indivisible, that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.\" Will Joe Biden refer to this or say similar words? No.",

While the Democratic party is fighting with itself, Trump has build a massive internet presence probably with the help of Russia and dark money. We need to learn from our mistakes. Hilary took states for granted that matter in the electoral college fight. Like it or not we can't win the presidency without winning the electoral college. Obama won because of very effective organizing, as well an appealing, fresh message. Maybe Biden can do this, his vast government experience, in spite of being a double edged sword, is very appealing after 4 years of Trump. But he will need a very strong, tough campaign to win and that will require support from younger voters. The sooner we get together behind a candidate the better.

I do believe that Biden is an inherently decent man who has been a politician of incredible longevity.  His record has some really dubious calls and alliances, but a politician must dance with the people who get him on the dance floor.  There are myriad structural changes required to fix our system beginning with how elections are funded, but we can't undertake them simultaneously. Trump has proven that knowledge, competence, honor, truthfulness and compassion aren't necessary qualities for a president. In the same way, Obama proved that decency, intelligence and gravitas often didn't count for much.  To that end, it doesn't really matter who becomes president if they don't have control of congress.  We are a nation of two parties so divided that government is like tic-tac-toe, a guaranteed stalemate. We must cease approaching voting for President as if we are choosing a homecoming queen. There are only two questions; can they win and will you help them do so by voting for the nominee regardless of whether they are your favorite. In the end you are voting for the party that most closely represents your values and concerns. Whomever the democratic nominee is, put down your personal concerns and vote for them, whether we like it or not, it is the party, not the candidate that matters.",

Biden gets little support from the disaffected who are politically disengaged but would vote Democratic if a candidate inspired them, as do Warren & Sanders. Too many potential Democratic voters stayed home in 2016 because of dissatisfaction with Hillary.  Biden could easily give us a replay of that in 2020, with disastrous results.\n\n In order to win, Democrats need a candidate who is more than just a nice guy.

He brags a little too much. He's a little touchy-feely. \n\nIn other words, he, like most of us, fall short of the mark. But at least there IS a mark. But if Trump does have a \"stable genius,\" it is the ability to drag people down into the dirt with him. The impeachment trial turned into his attorneys laying out every negative ad that's going to run.\n\nThis is where we are now. I watched the Watergate hearings. I was 17 and on summer break. I live in rural Kentucky, but my family always knew what was going on in the world. Now I can hardly bear to turn on the television (though I still read). It's depressing and sad. Mr. Comey argues that the time period of our youths was perhaps even worse. But at least there seemed to be people who cared about what was right. I have trouble finding that spirit now. All I hope is that this sense of futility hides the steely resolve that came out and beat Matt Bevin in our gubernatorial race, despite a free two hours of a televised rally the night before the election (a Trump love fest complete with Mitch and Rand and the President). \n\nJoe might not be perfect.

However, his voting record and bill sponsorship actually aligns most closely with Diane Feinnstein, putting him squarely between the very liberal and moderately liberal Democratic voting blocs.  \n\nHe is definitely liberal enough for this election and will easily carry the left and win the middle - which, last time anyone checked, is what actually wins Presidential elections.  Just ask Hillary.",

Anytime you hear that Bernie Sanders isn't the democratic Nominee, just know that Trump will be the President and vice versa. If Democrats really want to win, just close your eyes and give the nomination to Bernie Sanders. After all, he's only going to be the President for four years. I'm saying this from numerous personal encounters here in Pennsylvania since 2016 with Bernie Supporters who are usually anti establishment and their Second Choice is normally either Trump or Stay Home. They don't trust the two major political parties or politicians except Bernie, because he's Independent like them. I don't know why they only like Bernie, but I think because he's politically outcast like them by the two major political parties. Maybe They See Themselves In Him As The Enemy Of Their Enemies, so he's Their Friend. Apart from Bernie, I don't see any other democratic presidential candidate that has that ability to mobilize this anti establishment and young difficult voters in swing states; and Democrats usually only win when young and independent voters turn out in large numbers. That's because young Independent voters usually vote more progressive than their conservative parents in swing states. That's why Hillary lost those three key swing states, including Michigan and Wisconsin that Sanders won during the 2016 primaries.",

It turned out to be the most corrupt, criminal (until the current occupant?) presidency in modern history, if not ever in America.\n\nYes, Mr. Biden would be better than current occupant.\nWe can and should do better while we have multiple choices.\n\nThanks Joe; try the mash potatoes, needs more butter, but they aren't too salty tonight.

Will that be enough?  Certainly, we see that negative emotions are enough to motivate the public to the point that Trump got elected.  But can positive emotions be enough?  I really don't know.  It's very easy to make people hate and very hard to make them laugh.  This harkens to our primal anger-fight-to-survive instincts.  Trump is the king of producing those reactions.\n\nPersonally, I would like to see a bit more meat from Biden.  His soon to be chief rival, Bloomberg, is beginning to lay out his plans.  As a real businessman, that is Bloomberg's area.  But he lacks the personal connection of Joe Biden.  If we could merge the two, knock off about 20 years of age, we would have the ultimate candidate.  But no such person exists.  So we have to compromise.

Obama awarded him with the highest presidential civilian honor,  the Medal of Freedom.  Joe was at Obama's elbow for those 8 years, lending sage advice from his years of experience.  While Bernie's hollering about revolution and Warren's calls for radical change hold their appeal, they will not happen within the next 8 years.  For one example, the 38th State just ratified the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), after 48 years.  And there are still questions about whether it will be added to the Constitution.  Radical change is likely the slowest way to do things.  While I'll grant that Hunter Biden's job in Ukraine gave the appearance of impropriety, no ethical violations have been proven.  The GOP holds the Democrats to high standards that they themselves abnegate.  For example, GOP members in the Senate say that Trump did commit crimes, but that they did not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.  If that's the kind of reasoning, logic and inhumanity you crave, you won't find any of it in Joe Biden.  He's too busy working to form a more perfect Union for a vital reason:  So that the Nation Of the People, By the People and For the People, shall not perish from the Earth.",

If Democrats really want to win, just close your eyes and give the nomination to Bernie Sanders. After all, he's only going to be the President for four years. I'm saying this from numerous personal encounters here in Pennsylvania since 2016 with Bernie Supporters who are usually anti establishment and their Second Choice is normally either Trump or Stay Home. They don't trust the two major political parties or politicians except Bernie, because he's Independent like them. I don't know why they only like Bernie, but I think because he's politically outcast like them by the two major political parties. Maybe They See Themselves In Him As The Enemy Of Their Enemies, so he's Their Friend. Apart from Bernie, I don't see any other democratic presidential candidate that has that ability to mobilize this anti establishment and young difficult voters in swing states; and Democrats usually only win when young and independent voters turn out in large numbers. That's because young Independent voters usually vote more progressive than their conservative parents in swing states. That's why Hillary lost those three key swing states, including Michigan and Wisconsin that Sanders won during the 2016 primaries.",

They had not even been accused of a crime.\n\nIt is silently believed by many that Joseph Kennedy, father of John, bought the Democratic nomination for his son. In at least one case, the West Virginia primary, it is proven.  His father bribed Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana to turn out the union vote in West Virginia in return for Kennedy looking the other way. The go-between was Frank Sinatra.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tina-sinatra-mob-ties-aided-jfk\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tina-sinatra-mob-ties-aided-jfk</a>/\n\nThe most deadly abuse was by Lyndon Johnson. He wanted a free hand in the Vietnam War. One night in August, 1964, in the Gulf of Tonkin off Vietnam, a United States destroyer reported that it had been fired on by two North Vietnamese torpedo boats. U.S. aircraft found nothing. It was admitted that the destroyer had made a mistake. But Johnson went before Congress and lied about the incident. Congress gave him a resolution which he used to send a half million U.S. troops to Vietnam. Over 58,000 returned in body bags.\n\nAnd let me throw in Harry Truman, who authorized two atomic bombs to be dropped in the civilian centers of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A ridiculous case is made that this actually saved lives.",

The billions given to the Zionists while the Palestinians suffer and die at their hands, the abrogation of the JCPOA, murder of an Iranian hero, and the stationing of stealth fighter-bombers (f-35s, six of them) on Iran's borders soon afterwards, and the apparent willingness, looking ahead, to help Britain to exploit the mineral wealth of Africa, almost solely for their benefit, all point to a decided break with reality on the part of the powers of plutocracy. The whole place (Washington) could be populated by \"...cynical careerist(s)\". Again, looking ahead, it might be that more billions given to Ukraine are but a prelude to confronting the RF so as to try to do the same thing to their natural resources which are abundant.

The methodical process of testing and proving the validity of theories that underlies science is echoed by the systematic and brilliant analysis presented by  Adam Schiff and his superb team of house lawyers. Conversely, it is impossible to follow the logical trajectory of the various contradictory arguments put forth by the Republicans. He's innocent? Well no, (they say) but it doesn't matter that he's guilty. But it is a serious crime! No, (they say) he can't commit a crime because he's president. But they tried to impeach Clinton! Yes, but their ideas have \"evolved\". The mind reels.There is no logic or rational consistency to their case, but logical inconsistency has never been an issue for Trump followers. For them, any argument is a fighting match, and the strongest and most belligerent wins. End of story.

So... let's talk facts.  Fact, tax rates are not the primary driver of deficits.  Spending is.  Fact in all but 3 years between 1981-2019 government revenue grew year over year.  In all but a handful it outpaced prevailing inflation.  Deficits grew because government spending grew at 1.5-2.0x the inflation rate and above revenue growth.  In fact from 2007-2019 Federal Revenue grew from $2.6 Trillion to $3.5 trillion (33%) which was above the prevailing increase in inflation (24%).  The problem... Federal Spending increased from $2.7 T to $4.5 T (67.5%).  And yet you can't find me an article in the last 30 years where Krugman didn't call for even greater government spending.\n\nOn climate change, yes the climate is warming over the last 100+ years.  The problem is it is at less than half the rate the IPCC predicted.  In IPCC 1 (1991) they predicted \"0.3 degree C (range 0.2-0.5) increase per decade\".  According to NOAA/ GISS in the 29 years since then global temps have increase 0.42 degrees C total.  That's 0.14 deg C/ decade.  Less than half predicted and 27% below the low range estimate.  And yet Krugman et al continue to call for more and more radical changes to our energy infrastructure based on their predictions.  Who's the real zombie?  I say Professor Krugman and his fellow \"progressives\".",

How is it that basically they acted as a police force, made an arrest and took him to trial with no witnesses and no proof of crime other than a tip from someone not willing to testify. Any judge would lautgh them out of court. Then yesterday the DNC with 3 years to prepare can't even count votes in Iowa's caucus vote. I.E. \"Caucus Chaos\" as the news reported.

Social Security can be untouched.\n\nKelso saw automation coming. He believed it could liberate humans from toil. He thought almost everyone in America could receive 50% of  income from diversified investments.\n\nThis is a key to reversing the dangerous growth of inequality and poverty. If we intend to have one job sufficient to support individuals and families, let's convince Congress to pass the necessary legislation to establish a SECOND INCOME ACT. It can help unite our divided nation. \n\nA Universal Basic Income by itself (Yang's Freedom Dividend) has zero chance of Congressional approval. In order to provide immediate economic assistance, combine SECOND INCOMES with a transitional Universal Basic Income. These interim funds would gradually be displaced - as growing taxable earnings are realized by individuals from SECOND INCOMES. Look for that title under MORE at aesopinstitute.org \n\nTo end stock market concern, 85-90% of an individual\u2019s Second Income funds could be invested in Treasury Bills, as safe a place to put your money as exists.

These function like a government department (in the US case it would be a federal department).  The commission applies rules and standards equally according to its chartered Terms and Conditions.  These describe everything of importance that is part of the electoral process - from the size and composition of electorates to details such as actual voting process and what can and must happen at voting booths and who can and cannot vote - all of which is enshrined in legislation.  \n\nThe Electoral Commission then supervises the whole process and 'observes' the election to keep it honest.  It is designed to stop one party from taking unfair advantage over another, and to attempt to maintain a level playing field so that individual votes have equivalence and that individuals do actually get to vote and can't be unreasonably struck off the roll.\n\nIt doesn't stop governing parties from a bit of boundary fiddling to suit their agendas, but it does prevent things from becoming totally lopsided, and it does mean that dispute resolution (thinking Florida) is handled independently, and not by a local chapter of any party eg. at state level.",

The economic system became zero-sum Plunder Capitalism, enriching the Greedy Oligarchs while immiserating everyone else.

The GOP still needs millions of people to consistently and enthusiastically vote against their own interests; feeding them trickle-down myths is one way they accomplish that.\n\nAs with any deal with the Dark side, the GOP's embrace of greed corrupted them. The institutions of government that once defined \"America\" now exist solely to serve the GOP, which eagerly demolishes any institution that doesn't serve them.

It's all about the taxes, about rich people's money going to help the lowly masses who aren't rich because they don't deserve to be rich. \nSo, when Obama is in the WH, deficits are the boogy-man because GOP doesn't want him to borrow and spend on infrastructure and education, both solid reasons for borrowing for the future of America, things that will be seen as \"good\" by the unwashed. Then, when Republicans are in power, deficits are meaningless and the old trickle-down is trotted out again -- a concept that has failed over and over to produce anything good for America (except its oligarchs) -- to justify tax cuts. \nThanks, Dr. K. -- this point of view allows most of the seemingly crazy things Republicans espouse and vote for to be looked at below the surface and understood.

Why should they change - especially since they think they are \"winning.\" They are cheering this president on, & are convinced that Democrats are not real Americans. Only they represent the true America. They are determined to maintain power at all costs, & have zero interest in compromise. These folks are a danger to the functioning of any type of democracy or republic, because they do not believe in sharing power. We have to deal with them every day in Texas, because they run the state, & they are increasingly frightening in their lust for power & their willingness to do anything, no matter how cruel or heartless, to retain it.

How does a highly regulated state compete with a state that is dominated by a set of billionaire oligarchs in the global economy?  The Republicans actions are saying that America needs its own oligarchic leaders like Trump who can operate without constraints in order to do America's bidding in the international economy.  Trump needs to have the freedom and discretion to make deals with whoever he sees fit to work with, it won't correspond at all to the way a democratic society would operate however.

He ignores the history that tells us that ALL 6 times we paid the debt down by 10% or more, we fell into one of our 6 terrible depressions.\n\nHe apparently believes that the purpose of taxes is to pay for gov operations. This is just wrong. \n\nThe federal gov can create as much money as it needs. It then spends this money on government operations, e.g. the military, roads & bridges, research, education, etc. In this way money gets to you & I.\n\nNow while there is no theoretical limit on the creation of money, there is a practical one. If too much money is sent to the private sector, there will be excessive inflation. Taxes take some of this money back. \n\nHence the purpose of taxes is to adjust the amount of money in the economy.\n\nNote, however, if the budget is balanced, there will be no new money sent to the private sector to support a growing economy. Even worse, if the government shows a surplus & pays down the debt, money will be leeched out of the private sector. This explains the 6 depressions mentioned above.\n\nAlso a trade deficit takes money out of the economy. Hence to support a growing economy, the deficit must be larger than the trade deficit. Except for a brief period in 2003, this condition was not met from 1996 to 2008. And the economy crashed.",

Always I wondered how the German people could bring Hitler to power. Not only the heads of the German economy cooperated with him and not only the heads of the army - the masses saluted him zieg-heil. How did that happen? The answer is simple: Under certain conditions all human beings may lose reason, submit to political brainwashing and serve nasty purposes. History is full of such examples (not all of them as hideous as the Nazi example, but some are horrifying enough - Chile in the junta era, Franco's Spain, Iran today and a lot more). Is there any society capable of overcoming the evil forces that pushes it into self-destruction? Probably not, but history also proves that a society is capable of regenerating. South Africa is a good example. Germany - the same Germany - after the war. Also parts of former Yugoslavia. In my opinion, most of the renewal process comes only after a major explosion: a severe economic crisis, an internal or external war, a terrible natural disaster. For the USA we are now witnessing the pre-explosive era. Only after it occurs will decent leaders like those who headed the free world after World War II be elected again.

Not doing so much is going to cost us so much that it will likely require great sacrifices, including most of what we rely upon to live. But it will not go away if ignored which is what Republicans insist that we do.\n\nModern societies rely upon big governments and lots of revenues to satisfy our needs\ufffc. Nature cannot be changed, we can make us of how it works but we cannot make it work differently. That\u2019s what sound reasoning tells. Republicans have assumed a frame of mind that has been described as magical.",

Why do you think that Trump has been holding the rallies throughout his presidency? It's not to relive his glory and \"play the hits\" it is to spread propaganda. No one has called his \"rallies\" what they are - White Nationalist rallies. I mean they demonize \"anti-facists\" at these events! \nWhat about the other side? The majority of the nation? Wouldn't Rubio and the GOP's argument work the other way?  Wouldn't no evidence or witnesses divide the nation too? Wouldn't his acquittal cause outrage and division too?

We need to face those facts.It's not going to change.Greed and self interest have taken over the Republican Party, including the citizens that vote them in.\nBefore we know it.

Our priorities are upside down. \nWe have to wake up before it's too late.  People need to stop thinking what's in it for me and start thinking about what's best for everyone.\nThis Senate trial has finally shown the American People how truly self serving the Republicans are. How smug and nasty some can be.  And they are proud of it.\nTrump has enabled the American people to feel  that they can say and do anything. Regardless of right and wrong.  The bigotry and hatred on our country has never gone away.  It was just waiting for the right person to put it back in plain sight with a wink and baseless talk.\nVOTE VOTE VOTE it still means something.\nOtherwise we will see an apocalyptic world.",

But I now realize that only the final chapters of  the demise of American democracy mimic that of Germany's fall. The collapse of the Republican party, as described in this article, is a major factor, but its origins extend far earlier than Mr. Krugman's exposition. Teddy Roosevelt was probably the last really good Republican president. Dwight Eisenhower was a war hero whose best contributions were the Interstate road system and his parting warning about the military-industrial complex. George H. W. Bush was someone who displayed moral character, but was mediocre as a leader. The other Republican presidents dating at least from the beginning of the 20th century have been incompetent, or amoral, or outright corrupt, and sometimes a combination of all three. Which raises the question: is the collapse of the Republican moral ethic a result of presidential lack of integrity, or does the Republican party's general low level of ethics result is selecting the kinds of candidates it places up for election to President.  It's ironic that the last Republican presidential candidate who demonstrated a high level of integrity and respect for law was John McCain, who lost.",

Asking voters to help pay for cars that cost about twice what they could, on average, afford for themselves is a very bitter pill to swallow.

However, people's stance on such issues is not necessarily on the basis of moral or practical principles which are nominally accepted by everyone, such as equal rights, Christian (or other) charity and acceptance of facts, but simply on what amounts to tribal identification.  Generally loyalty to one's tribe is more important than moral or scientific principles.\n\nDemocrats have failed to stop Trump at several stages by focusing on moral and personal matters.  Republicans actually did little harm to Bill Clinton by the same approach.  Concentrating on such matters just seems to increase polarization on tribal grounds. Trump may have already lost the 2020 election, mainly by his blatant failure to keep some of his economic promises, but if Democrats need many more votes it will probably have to be by offering a combination of economic and other stances that will directly make a difference to people, not by claiming to be the party of high principle.

Yet, Nunes had the cheek to sit as ranking member of house intelligence committee and instead of defending Trump, simply lashed out at his fellow democrats, at every given opportunity. Essentially they had no defense of Trump not his character not his ethics not his morals not his duty. So instead they attacked democrats and the senate republicans and WH lawyers did the same, including high profile Ken Starr (cringe).\nAre we supposed to behave as though we are blind deaf mute and without perception insight!! Good heavens. Ashamed of these republicans with no soul no conscience no ethics. Jill Biden tells us Lindsay Graham used to be a good friend but something happened to his brain heart once trump was elected. Now he is after Biden family, insanely jealous that Biden son dared to become rich while Trump children parade all over the world flashing Trump brand. Conflict of interest sheesh!",

And just in case those voters aren't enough\u2014they've also learned how to suppress enough of the opposition vote to make their victory secure. Real democracy\u2014government of, by, and for the people\u2014is a threat to their power and to their donors' wallets. They'll do whatever they can to hold it in check.\n\nThere is a candidate, Elizabeth Warren, who is running on ending a corrupt system where monied interests buy the government they want to benefit themselves. Quite telling, though, was when Lamar Alexander\u2014a so-called moderate Republican\u2014said that the reason he was voting to acquit Trump is because Trump is advancing the interests of the donor class (tax cuts, deregulation, business-friendly judges) and is therefore better than that anti-corruption reformer Warren. \n\nAlexander made it clear. Even \"moderate\" Republicans will support an authoritarian bigot like Trump if he protects the interests of the donor class and keeps reformers from getting the power they need to end the corruption.",

I think a good start to fixing it would be for all of us to apply more common sense and good judgement, less going along to get along, and less mindless rule following in lieu of mindful consideration.",

Some just don\u2019t care what will happen in 50 years\u2019 time. Other deniers think the world is an overpopulated mess and an apocalypse is needed, and if climate change brings it about, so be it.  Both groups are afraid to admit these beliefs, and instead pretend that the scientific consensus is wrong. \n\nIs there any evidence of this ? Yes it\u2019s clear from the blank refusal of the deniers to consider the scientific models of the climate, or the abundant evidence on the ground, the heatwaves in Australia, the melting glaciers, the warming North Polar regions. The fact that Trump wants to buy Greenland, says everything you need to know about climate change denial.\n\nTo deal with the deniers it\u2019s important to stop endlessly presenting more and more detailed evidence, it will never work. Instead focus on their true beliefs and frame the conversation around two issues, fatalism and nihilism. There may be more common ground than you might think.",

What accounts for the white male dominance of Republican senators, when there is a large demographic of Republican female voters. Shine a spotlight on each of the 51 who voted not to call witnesses and in doing so placed party loyalty to Trump above country.",

Lincoln recognized there could be no Union if the southern secessionists were allowed to continue to undermine democratic institutions.  We confront a similar crisis today.  We cannot maintain the Union and democracy if one of the major parties is determined to ignore the Constitution at every turn.  Obama was like Buchanan - weak and vacilitating in the face of the southern oppositionists.  The next Democratic president needs to be like a Lincoln and stand up to the right-wing with unflinching firmness.",

Senators Jacob Javits and Charles Goodell [both of NY], Charles Percy of Illinois, Everett Dirksen of Illinois, High Scott and Richard Schweicker [both of PA], Mark Hatfield and Bob Packwood [both of Oregon] demonstrated pen mindedness to discuss critical issues with Democrats. The pernicious cultism of Republicanism secured a permanent, firm hold upon the party of Lincoln, and yesterday is gone. The GOP is the refuge party of the ever diminishing voice and presence of Caucasian blue collar, less than college [and in some cases, high school school] educated, Christian Evangelicals. Their unfounded paranoia of being displaced by the so called brown invasion from Mexico, fearful of losing their coveted jobs to these dark complexioned individuals, and their groundless fear of racial miscegenation fuels the immigrant xenophobia and racial internecine.

It's an ideology that masks an upwardly redistributive policy at the heart of Republican politics (and even a good share of Democratic doctrine) for half a century. It does exactly what it's supposed to do, no more and no less, and continues to be deployed precisely because it's so effective in making the rich richer while generating a misdirected politics of outrage and entitlement among white people that then feeds back against African Americans, women and minorities. \n\nThe real focus should be on why the large number of working and middle class white Republicans continue to support the policies that so clearly are not in their economic interests; or, more provocatively, whether they're in fact rational in a zero-sum neoliberal system in which net gains by women and minorities in an increasingly skewed economic environment come at their expense. Labeling it \"zombie\" takes away both their agency and the complex positive values they feel it brings to them which outweighs the direct economic costs compared with a more progressive and inclusive set of policies. \nMark LeVine\nDepartment of History\nUC Irvine",

Every Republican that voted to abreviate the senate trial, and not subpoena witnesses and pertinent documents, and instead acted to protect the clown on chief were complicit in it's demise. Every single one of them. They will be remembered to be sure, but not in a way that any one of them would want to be. Ultimately they will be scorned for what they orchestrated and achieved. They heard the evidence just like I did and chose to ignore it. Maybe they think it will just go away, if that's the case they are dead wrong and so is their party. It's a poison that's not going away, and while it may continue to effect our political life for some time to come, eventually it will wither and die. We as a nation of immigrants will survive this pestilence and I trust be stronger for it. I pray for that to be true, the alternative is too horrific to seriously contemplate. As a John McCain Republican with whom I shared a comrades in arms bond, I will do everything in my power to see that they are all defeated at every opportunity.

Because this notorious group, particularly in the Senate and Trump's Cabinet, know darn well what they are doing.  Trance, no; determined, destructive, and deliberate egregiousness, yes indeed.  Now about that absence of a free will, that would be correct because the Party is in the back pockets of too many of America's oligarchs. They need them in order to stay in power and for their own insatiable greed.  Actually, one could say that their dependence is mutual, on each other like parasites.  Now about that \"trance\" definition.  We can not let the electorate who put these microorganisms in office get off so easily.  There is the trance..the climate deniers, the racially and ethnically ignorant, and the evangelicals who insist on remaining in fiction rather than the real world.  So, Paul, yes and no about living zombies.  But I would feel better if we could come up with a description more stinging.  Any thoughts?",

(Recall Grover Norquist's plea to shrink revenue so the welfare programs would starve to death?)  Decreasing tax revenue enriched the wealthy, which is why the wealthy wanted it to happen and paid the GOP to make it happen.  Second, Reagan noted the demographic trend in California for minorities to become majorities, first in the public schools, then in the workplace, and finally in the voting booth.  He and the GOP believed this would happen to the entire country around the middle of the century, so they decided to sink the country so deeply into debt that minorities would be left with nothing but scorched earth when they took over.  All this debt, of course, meant more transfer of wealth to the already-wealthy.  My concluding thought is that Trump's supporters are largely from the bottom fifth of all families, possessing a median net worth of not much at all.  They don't understand that the the GOP did this to them, and for the life of me I don't understand why the Democrats are not willing to tell them about it, over and over and over.",

Mr. Krugman takes no account of any of them.\n\n1.  The Republican National Committee will distribute about a billion dollars in campaign funds over the next year.  The head of the DNC was appointed by Trump and will do what she can to assure that those who oppose Trump get no money.  If anyone goes out on his own, the RNC will fund pro-Trump primary candidates to defeat the mavericks.  (This is how Jeff Flake was beaten back.)\n\n2.  The Republican Party has divided in two -- the mainstream and the Tea Party.  Neither faction carries a majority, so the only way to enact a Republican agenda is by uniting behind Trump.\n\n3. Cooperation with the Democrats has gotten more difficult because the Democrats have moved to the left and the Republicans have moved to the right. Even if the two parties wanted to bury the hatchet, there is little to agree upon.\n\nKrugman claims that Republicans are corrupt and beyond redemption.  But claiming the high groumd is unproductive.  The fact is that political forces have backed the Republicans into a corner and left them with a choice of committing political suicide or compromising their integrity.\n\nIf Democrats acknowledged the truth they would be in a better position to improve the situation.

But it's always darkest before the dawn.\n\nThe Iowa results tonight will begin to bring unification to the Democratic Party.  The results will also provide clarification as to how accurate the polls have been so far this year.\n\nWe need to focus on the non-voters and third-party voters from 2016 and bring them back into the Democratic fold this time around.  They will be the key to victory in November.\n\nI am not succumbing to despair.  Many voters were fooled four years ago, thinking that Trump would eventually \"become\" presidential.  Enough of us have learned from our mistakes and will not be fooled again.  But the same is not true for Trump and his GOP enablers.\n\nNature seeks to restore balance.  Americans will lend a hand with that soon enough.  We will do the right thing.  As we always do ... sooner or later.",

            "comment_body": "So much to say about this. Yes, there should be a requirement for national service of at least 2 years. In the days of the draft, we were slave labor. Starting army pay in 1966 was about $90 gross (before taxes) a month. It worked out to 10 cents an hour, less than 1/10 of the minimum wage ($1.25/hr. at the time). It was about service and sacrifice. We trusted our government then, even if we were skeptical about the Vietnam war. Our fathers and some mothers had served in WWII so we were raised with some sense of national duty. \n\nWhat many people today don't realize is that opposition to the Vietnam war grew slowly. Those of us in service realized that the rich and privileged bought doctors & psychiatrists to get their teenage sons out of the draft. Awareness of the U.S. class structure began to develop. Kids in college got a 4-year deferment as undergraduates. Politicians and other \"leaders\" didn't question the war until 1968.\n\nWith the end of the draft, the MIC and conservative thinks knew that future wars would cost a lot more money. Yet, they discovered that the U.S. population didn't complain if their kids weren't involved. And that has proved true. Now, we're in numerous, regime-change wars. Many men who didn't serve then pursued their own agenda in corporations and government. Now, many of them are pro-war, often to serve their own agenda of war-profiteering. \n\nWe can't go on this way.  Most of the U.S. population, especially the Veterans, have been betrayed.",

Since 2020 California has been devasted by decades of drought, wildfires, two massive earthquakes, and an intractable homeless problem resulting from huge wealth, income and opportunity gaps. Thanks to continued under-investment by PG&E, the power grid in much of the state is fragile and subject to hacking by foreign powers. Unreliable power adds to California's woes . \n\nGeneral disorder caused by a severely degraded environment, social polarization and ethnic \u201cunrest\u201d prompts the Chinese government to send troops to protect the \u201cinterests\u201d of ethnic Chinese, which now make up a majority of the California population.\n \nThe US is powerless to stop the Chinese after they have brought the economy to its knees by strangling the supply chain of everything needed for basic assembly of the electronic components and mechanical parts needed for civilian medical care and agriculture, and defense and arms production.  \n\nWith the national power grid hacked and inoperable, military satellites neutralized by the anti-satellite technology,  and the US military in disarray,  the Chinese sail into San Francisco Bay, and deploy their troops with virtually no resistance. Within two months, the newly installed State Legislature declares its independence from the United States and becomes the first Chinese colony in North America. Privately, our government braces for a similar effort in Washington state.",

Maybe I'd read that before. Is this a repost? Perhaps reposted for the 100th time? Because I'd read it SO many times in the past, it became... a rerun. But it WAS NOT a rerun. If it wasn't a rerun, and I just heard it again for the even the 50th time.... quick math here....10 to 15 MILLION people have been affected here. \n\nThe point I am having a hard time getting out here is this: Until the Chinese (or Russians, or N Koreans, or Iranians or...) come marching down my little street here in Anywhere USA, it doesn't affect me and therefore it's up to someone else to worry about.

Rather, let's institute universal military training with perhaps a minimum term of service thereafter.

The social and political benefits are obvious and detailed by many informed observers (and veterans) will be more than worth the effort and expense. Moreover, those values extend throughout the lives of every participant and reach all quarters of our society. The military or national defense and security value of a ready force of an already trained population of people is clearly evident. Other nations do this; we can and should too. Absent this type of action we will continue to encourage societal division and detachment. We also encourage a professional warrior force seen by too many as other than courageous volunteers and more as an armed force that can be controlled by political factions and leaders and a corps of military leaders who may choose to challenge civilian and political leaders and constraints.

What about the disastrous actions of some of Mr. Prince's Blackwater \"security contractors\" during the Iraq war? The infamous Nisour Square shooting spree resulted in two federal convictions of the five Americans accused, with defense lawyers arguing they were just shooting back in a theater of war. It was the reality of  Mr. Brooks' line \"immunity from not only war crimes but all crimes under U.S. law.\"\n\nThe Iraq and Aghanistan Wars introduced the public to the concept of troops for hire, with hundreds of millions of dollars paid to Blackwater. Now, according to the NY Times, Mr. Prince is lobbying the Trump administration to use private contractors in Afghanistan to aid in the potential withdrawal of U.S. troops. It would seem a more realistic scenario of the corporate takeover of U.S. military security might be a multitude of Prince-like entrepreneurs, each looking to grab a share of the action, instead of the more Hollywood style mega corporation controlling everything.",

The big difference seems to be that we're no longer fighting in the jungle were we can't see the \"enemy\" (note: the Vietnamese, now unified, are our friends), but can clearly inflict casualties on tens of thousands of civilians all across the Arab world, if not directly, then by the war-mongering that we have enabled.\n\nIn a society that is increasingly divided, there is little common sense of purpose or identification with most of our fellow citizens.  Youth owes nothing to a society which gives them many more benefits (opportunities are much more dependent upon family connections) than their parents ever knew.  Our soldiers increasingly come from the same community and families.  Those who fight are more likely to have fewer options than their more well-to-do counterparts.  Those who fight are more likely to return as \"volunteers\" for a second, third and fourth tour to combat hot zones.\n\nBring back the draft and/or equivalent national service.  Men and women both (ERA?).  A good way to grow up a little more, to learn hands-on and social skills.

War is a dirty business and rules of civilized engagement no longer apply and haven't for over 50 years. Anyway, it is a moot point - future warfare will be AI-driven.

Add to it the movement towards near 100% military contracting in the areas of technology -- think IT, AI, ML -- and the current uniformed military have little to no internal capability to maintain or even use their own advanced systems without massive contractor support. The line between civilian and uniformed military is so blurry in some areas that we ought accept the fact that the real warfighting military now includes both uniformed and deployable civilians in near equal numbers. Its time we rethink what all this means. Even better, we ought re-think what the term \"war\" really means. Although our last declaration of war was in 1941, the fact is we have been at war many, many times since. The rise of contracting war makes it all the more necessary that we reexamine the definition of military service and use of military force.",

Moreover, the Army is only one part of a larger branch organization within the Pentagon/DoD.  A more probative question would ask if indeed the Pentagon itself has been privatized.  It no longer functions strictly under civilian control, while public law legislation, such as the US Patriot Act, have blurred many lines of separation and distinction among combat, intelligence, and executive functions.  Mr. Brooks cites September 2001.  That is precisely the event, codified in the GWOT (Global War on Terror) that has quietly transformed defense strategy and control, while undermining Constitutional protections across several of its dimensions.  As the Middle East \"Deal of the Century\" announced by Trump and Netanyahu last week in Washington demonstrates, private special interests are deeply embedded in otherwise assumed US public sovereignty.",

The companies that became active in this industry needed to make enough money to make its investors happy.  Obviously that was not possible without a few on-going wars.  So, each company had to change its \"marketing department\" into a department dedicated to starting wars.  And, to out do George Orwell, they called the new department \"The Peace Department\" or TPD. \n\nTo start wars, TPDs hired many Russians who were already trained in hacking computer systems, spreading misinformation, and creating divisions and animosity among various nationalities within multi-national countries.  They hired ex-CIA agents to assassinate top political leaders.  They paid bloggers and Social Media experts handsomely to spread rumors and start demonstrations. They trained sharp shooters to take strategic positions on demonstration routes to be able to shoot at both police and demonstrators.  \n\nSo, today that we have so many wars involving US and its private companies, no one should complain.  We knew exactly what we were doing.  And if today other countries are trying to start war inside the US, we should remember that we are simply sewing the seeds that we planted.",

Your desire may be for all human beings to be equal. The truth is that people are not equal in their natural endowments, and that every attempt to establish perfect social equality has failed. Your desire may be for for nature to be benevolent and helpful. The truth is that nature is blind and amoral. Your desire may be for universal peace. The truth is that there has never been a human culture free of violence. Voters are free to pursue their collective desires but not at the expense of the facts. Once they believe they can remake reality to suit their utopian dream or populist hatred, the result is a totalitarian dictatorship. Whether this dictatorship is called fascist or socialist is immaterial. In \u201c1984\u201d the Party functionary tells the protagonist that there is no objective truth. But 2+2 still equals 4.",

And for that reason I find it difficult to understand his basic thesis, that elections control which desires will be catered to, but should play no role in determining truth.  In his climate change illustration, he explains that elections should determine such questions as whether we allow the polar bears to die out, whether certain areas  be flooded, and whether we should slow production to lower carbon emissions--but not to ascertain whether climate change is really happening,  really being caused by human activity and is becoming irreversible.  But the desires we have vis-a-vis handling our climate will depend on which version of the truth we accept.  If one candidate says the whole matter is a hoax, climate is not changing--and therefore we should not do anything about it, certainly not interfere with economic growth to regulate carbon emissions---that we should  encourage \"beautiful coal\" mining--isn't this candidate running on his version of the truth, and voting for him becomes an expression of accepting his truth?

Harari says Brexit was about desires, not fact, and there is no reason to defer such questions to experts.  But this response ignores that there are various ways to adjudicate competing desires.   In most of the western world, the system that has evolved since the Enlightenment is representative democracy.   The voters judge who would best represent them in a governing body, and the governing body then makes the hard decisions. \n\nThose decisions require the governing body to weigh competing facts and desires--a process that would be nearly impossible for individual voters to undertake.   Whether or not Great Britain should remain in the EU is a topic of incandescent complexity.  The point is not that experts should therefore make the decision (which Dawkins in-artfully suggested); it's that elected representatives should make that decision.   \n\nYes, the Brexit question is about public policy rather than \"truth.\"  But who said that all policies should be put to direct vote?  Almost no one, since the days of New England town meetings, or maybe Periclean Athens.  Direct democracy arguably works in those small scale settings; it clearly does not in a complex modern world.   The voters do their best, but they invariably rely on gut feelings.  Representative democracy is the system that makes intelligent compromise possible.",

People's desires don't happen in a vacuum, they are shaped partly by the irrational (emotion/religious belief), but they also should be shaped by facts. One of the reasons that the government pushed for universal education in the US (at least in the north pre civil war) was that they wanted an electorate able to vote on facts, to make rational decisions. The problem with desires and beliefs is that they lead, not to rational decision making, but electing people like Trump and the GOP that sits still for them. You might argue that people have the right to vote their desires, and of course they do, but that is what causes what you see in Europe, where countries like Hungary and Poland are reverting back to 1930's fascist like governments. In the US, we see a world where the fundamentalist Christians are being allowed to use their beliefs to govern society, despite the fact they are a minority, we have courts and judges and legislatures who call 'religious liberty' the right for religious numbnuts to impose their beliefs on others, and want to know something? The truth doesn't matter much when religious bigots can use their beliefs to hurt people, make them conform to their beliefs, live the way they want. Libertarians claim that is a good thing, but they to be honest are naive idiots, because the natural state of human beings in not rational thought, it isn't tempered emotions, it is lord of the flies.",

Any and all government mistakes are hidden from the general public.  Only favorable news to the government is aired.

In the interim, a long parade of right-wing groups and politicians have essentially run under the slogan \"we'll make true what you want.\" In other words, turning desire into truth. Don't like foreigners? Build a wall. Uppity women make you uncomfortable? Let's restrict their reproductive and other civil rights? Nostalgic for a whiter country? Let's make sure it stays that way!\n\nThis is precisely the point we find ourselves at today. In the early 1930s, plenty of Germans voted the National Socialist Party into parliament, and soon Hitler was vice-chancellor. These voters voted their desires: stop social disorder, get rid of troublemakers, get rid of Jews, Slavs and others who some Germans blamed for their loss of national pride and economic strength after WWI. Yes, they had to ignore the truth -- Jews and Slavs are not inferior, left-wing workers were not responsible for Germany's predicament -- but it was exactly elevating their desires that enabled them to ignore these truths.\n\nI think Harari has made a useful distinction, but I don't see how to apply it to solve our current dilemma. To the extent that there are overlapping desires from both sides in the US, great, let's talk about that. But someone has to change what they want, or make those desires secondary to social peace, or just accept that they won't get what they want. And that's where we are stuck.",

The Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the teachings of nineteenth-century science and economics have omitted nothing ... that seemed even vaguely useful for furthering such degradation, beginning with modern astronomy -- which turned the focal point of the universe, that sublime arena where God and Satan struggled to possess the creature whom they both ardently coveted, into an unimportant little planet, and ... has put an end to man's grand position in the cosmos ...'\n\n\"'There is no such thing as pure knowledge. The validity of ecclesiastical science -- which can be summarized in Saint Augustine's statement: 'I believe, that I may understand' -- is incontrovertible. Faith is the vehicle  of understanding, the intellect is secondary. ... Whatever profits man is true. ... Theoretical knowledge with no practical application in the realm of man's salvation is so totally uninteresting that we must deny it any value as truth and exclude it entirely. ... It is childish to believe that the Church defended darkness against light. Rather, she did what was right ... in declaring criminal any 'unbiased' striving for a knowledge of things. What has led man into darkness, and will continue to lead him ever deeper is 'unbiased' -- that is, aphilosophical -- natural science.'\"",

But not a 100% chance of 10% decrease. You suggest experts can reach consensus on these numbers, which if true would really help people make better informed decisions. But the truth is that they can't. Not because of self serving bias (which is a problem), but because of the inherent complexity of the economy.\n\nThe economy, like the climate, is a very complex system. Stoping carbon emissions today would not reduce economic growth, but kill almost immediatly millions of people. That is with 100% certainty, all energy experts would tell you.

Harari\u2019s solution is voting for politicians who support the institutions of the truth, but this alone will not mitigate the threat; after all, this solution is overly reliant on the very institution it strives to save. \n\nIn addition, we must endow the emerging voting demographic with a sufficient civics education. As it stands, the state of civics education in this country is shockingly subpar.

Unfortunately, the long tradition of rhetorical reasoning, which takes desire and emotion and beliefs and values and acknowledged facts into a process of reaching the best grounds for agreement is mostly forgotten in education and mostly untaught. Among our many recent disinheritances, this is certainly a consequential one. \n\nSecond, the way we express our disagreement matters. The bitter hostility and extreme statements from some of our political leaders have now gone beyond the pale. These statements serve their political purpose on one level, but they alienate most voters (who have tuned out) and they do lasting damage. Democracy can be rough and tumble without being bitter and hostile and destructive. \n\nThird, Harari seems to me over-optimistic about academic institutions. Higher education has been captured by one political party. This is evidenced by party affiliation and campaign contributions. Boghossian et. al. have exposed the lack of integrity in journal editorial boards. The UC system is now being undermined by using diversity pledges to discriminate against job candidates. The Democratic Party's capture of the faculty is complete, and the radical activist wing of that party has now captured administrative power, too. \n\nFinally, the media is self-evidently anti-Republican.",

For example, the desire of the many in the last election led us to choose Trump to be President and those of us who had a different desire had to take our lumps. As long as a democratic system is in place the electorate (so to speak) will choose its leaders and be stuck with its choices. Being a philosopher, Harari is in love with truth and facts matter to him because the truth is based on facts. But the electorate is not composed of philosophers (as he surely understands) and desire unleashed from facts can and does trump truth in many instances. Yes, the desires of the many can go awry, and so must be brought under the sway of philosophy (love of truth.) That was Plato's point and human nature hasn't changed all that much since he said it. There's nothing wrong with desire of course. After all, we humans have a complex soul. The part we call desire just needs to be led to make good choices by the part we call reason. Sometimes we are able to do that and sometimes we aren't and when we don't a Trump is what we get. It's reason's turn this time.",

            "comment_body": "I think many readers misunderstand Harari's claim that elections are about a \"peaceful compromise\". To my understanding, he is not here claiming that they are about producing bi-partisan deals and policy compromises. Rather, accepting the results of elections is *itself* the compromise: almost all Democrats accept that Trump is the president, even if they hate the fact and have qualms about the electoral college system. Thus the Obama administration willingly (if sadly) handed the reigns of the government over to him and his people.  Equally, most Republicans, accepted the Democrats taking back the House in 2018, and willingly (if begrudgingly) handed the gavel to Ms. Pelosi whom they hate so much. \nThe compromise, in other words, is accepting the mechanism of elections as that which determines who holds power. The alternative, as Harari points out, is physical violence. \nYou can mention gerrymandering and even outright voter fraud etc etc all you want. These are serious issues, but they are only issues BECAUSE the underlying premise of Mr. Harari's holds true. Everyone accepts elections as the decisive factor and THEREFORE fight so hard to win them (including sometimes in ethically dubious or outright criminal ways!). This point may seem trivial but it is not. History shows that this compromise is neither self-evident not invincible. It can break down (e.g. the American Civil war) and when it does the consequences are always dire.",

That they are entirely separate things, with different areas for their application. It\u2019s a good treatment\u2026but it\u2019s not enough. We need more original thought on this relationship. There are problems to overcome.\nDo we really want to encourage even less truth in elections? Isn\u2019t it bad enough?\nWe still have to unravel whether (and when) there is \u201cOnly one truth,\u201d or \u201cMultiple truths.\u201d (See today\u2019s article on Goop that implicitly gets at this.) \nExisting institutions for \u201cDoing Truth,\u201d academia and media, have their own blind spots and complacencies. \nComplex societal issues tend to hold interconnected issues of fact (some of which may not be), interpretation, and values. Simply calling for their separation doesn\u2019t help. \nNon-voters (not those who can but don\u2019t bother) deserve concern, too, such as the species with whom we share the planet, and future citizens.\nI flagged an article with a title showing me we\u2019re up to 50 cognitive biases now.

Children the intellectually or emotionally impaired ought to be subject to reasonable constraints.  Unfettered passions often have negative consequences.\n\nCivilization depends on a delicate balance between desire and reason.  Our current problem in the USA is that one man and his cult of personality have radically tilted the balance away from fact based understanding and positive emotions.  \n\nWe can hope that positive desires for knowledge, truth, transparency and humane decency will weigh appropriately in the coming elections. Unfortunately, the US Senate has provided evidence that they will not.\n\nAnd we have a Vice President and a Secretary of State who are passionate about the Second Coming:\n\n'A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   \nA gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   \nIs moving its slow thighs, while all about it   \nReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   \nThe darkness drops again; but now I know   \nThat twenty centuries of stony sleep\nWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   \nAnd what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   \nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\"   \n\nYeats\n\nSo far in the 21st century, political and religious desires are doing violence to reason.",

Consider the much-vaunted Iraqi election of 2005, which merely sorted that battered country into Shiia and Sunni subgroups. In America, the election of Lincoln didn't resolve the question of chattel slavery, only war did. And no election in 2020 will resolve the problem that a significant minority--indeed, the largest single faction in the country--does not want to live with democratic compromise but has surrendered to a malignant cult of personality. Because the opposition to Trump is fragmented, he will likely win reelection, but even if he doesn't, the election will do no more than the impeachment to rescue our dying nation. Whenever I hear people call for compromise in these conditions, they're really just saying they hope their side wins. I, for one, will never support him or his vision of America, no matter how many of my \"fellow citizens\" cast their votes for him. And I don't expect them to ever to agree with me, either.",

This struck me again when it turned out that the 51 Senators who voted not to hear any further witnesses or see any further evidence in the impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump represented 19 million fewer Americans than the 49 Senators who voted to hear the evidence. \nJust as the fact that 3 million more people voted for Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump didn\u2019t matter to this version of American democracy, neither does that the 1.2 million people in Wyoming and Alaska have exactly the same representation in the Senate as the 60 million people living in New York and California.

In general, that assumption is justified, e.g., the child wants to eat all of his Halloween candy at once, despite receiving the high-quality information that eating large amounts of candy at one sitting is going to give him a tummy ache.  The child wants the pleasure of eating the candy and doesn't want to get ill.\nThus the problem with Professor Harari's argument that neatly divides:\n- (1) an individual's desire for an outcome\n- (2) the quality of information available to choose among outcomes\n- (3) the capability of an individual to use that information to make such a choice.\nThe Framers of the Constitution, even without knowledge of the work of Kahneman and Twersky, understood that most people don't have the time or expertise to make complex decisions.  Their solution, representative democracy, however, was more fragile than they hoped.\nTo make a computer analogy, the US Operating System, aka the Constitution, has been hacked.  May of its error correction features (separation of powers, Amendment, Impeachment) have been disabled.  Last week, the already hacked Senate decided that damaging its last remaining protective facility -- relatively frequent and fair elections -- is no big deal.\nSo, the US OS is now broken, leaving us at the mercy of a physics that couldn't care less about human choice.",

So, elections do, as everything else, find their own truth.  Meaning that if ballots are freely cast, there is an accounting of the preferences of We The People, reduced to a vote count.  Because votes to not think; people do (or would do well to do).  In the Supreme Court, the facts of cases are brought in, pleaded by attorneys representing the interests of the two parties to a conflict of the interpretation of the law.  The verdict, ideally, reflects the opinions of the judges who, presumably, are experts at finding the truth.  But that \"truth\" is a construct of the interpretation of the evidence set before them.  Except in cases decided unanimously, in the end, there are members of the Court who interpret the facts differently.  Not as they might desire; but as the facts, according to their analysis, determine.  In this age of the algorithm, we will be beset by the prevalence of AI (artificial intelligence) where machines will evaluate information about us.  In the case of AI software reading Xrays and other images, the machine is more accurate than humans.

On that basis, there is an argument to be made that the masses may not be knowledgeable, wise, and trustworthy enough to make important produential judgments.\n\nGoing in hand with this, on the other side, is the fact that experts have been gravely wrong too many times to count.  When they don't perform well, and become full of their expertise reputation to the extent it becomes a self-affirming dogma, they mess up.\n\nThere are firm intellectual reasons to be skeptical about Darwinian evolutionary claims from experts.

This and other drawbacks of plebiscites that are decided on the basis of a simple majority (and may also have be held on the basis of a small number of people asking for such a plebiscite) are a blunt tool for democracies.

Desires are not in general formed independently of beliefs.  Typically, what one desires to do is a function of what one believes will be efficacious in bringing about one's ends, and people with knowledge -- experts -- are more likely to be right about such questions.  Perhaps some desires are \"ultimate\", uninformed by our beliefs.  But insofar as our desires are shared -- we want  a healthy economy, safety, etc. -- those with knowledge will better know what else we should desire (to stay in the EU, to support NATO ) in order to obtain the objects of those shared desires than do non-experts.  And even when we have little reason to think our \"ultimate\" desires are shared, people lacking expertise are likely to have little or no idea what the consequences of acting on their desires are, whereas people with relevant expertise will.    What would you rather do: act on the uninformed desires of people clueless as to the consequences of such action, or act on the informed desires of those who have some good idea what will happen if we do?  Identifying genuine expertise -- whom to trust about what -- is of course a challenge, as is distinguishing those of good from those of ill will.   But the general idea that what experts desire and what the uninformed desire are on par is ridiculous and dangerous.",

If they were about compromise, we would use some system of proportional representation to choose legislators, and we would have the executive branch be headed by an executive council rather than by one individual.  Or at the very least, we would use some kind of ranked-choice voting system where the second-choice preferences of a sufficiently large supermajority could outweigh the first-choice preferences of a sufficiently small plurality.",

We must equally defend the desires of disparate people who have a right to speak and have their votes counted.  Democracy is a beautiful and wondrous mess of human fulfillment.

            "comment_body": "A better view of what elections are is to consider the choosing of an alpha male in a pride of lions.  It is complex and even more so for the alpha male (or female) of the human herd.  Certainly individual strength is a factor in mono to mono competition but this really is a litmus test for likely success as a predator later bringing down game.  Maybe this correlates to leadership qualities that help in group hunts.  Individual affiliations (sometimes blood) are also key.  The net that should emerge is our alpha-male leader is determined by what the collective thinks is our best chance at biological success.  A premise in elections is a plurality of opinions knows best -- likely because of individual strength and good affiliations.\n\nWith humans, not in animal kingdoms, trust seems a strong factor and likeability.  These are not easily seen in a pride of lions.\n\nCertainly behind interest in an election is needs -- the needs to eat, sleep, and comfortable exist.  Are these desires?  Well I guess.  It is more complex.  It is a mysterious net of things. \n\nCertainly the back story for democracy is that a sufficient level of civilization has been accomplished that allows for brainier types to rule things and for an election to be possible.  You need the infrastructure (voting booths) and a level of education (reading and writing) to be extant.  The collective needs to be sufficient large so local (blood line) control is no longer possible.  Instinctual controls recede.",
