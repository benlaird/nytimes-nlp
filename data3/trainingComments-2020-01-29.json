Without the commitments Friedman requires of Netanyahu, this plan is not worth the 50 pages of paper it is written on.  With the This is not the vision of a sane person.  Without the commitments Friedman requires of Netanyahu, this plan is not worth much more, because the Palestinians will never agree to it.  \n\nOf course the Palestinians have given no indication that they will ever agree to anything that permits the continuation of Israel as a Jewish state ... but they will certainly not agree to this plan.  Some Arab states might support it - or at least not oppose it - because they are tired of the Palestinian problem and would accept any ending to it.  But acceptance by some Arab states will not lead to acceptance by the Palestinians.\n\nTrump seems to think [?] that the Palestinians are in a weak position and hence have to accept whatever terms are offered.  They are certainly in a weak position, but they have been in a weak position for many years and have never accepted better terms (which have been offered many times).",

He really only understands and uses Authoritarian Reasoning which is so much easier.  How do we know what is true?  As Authoritarian Followers of an Authoritarian Leader, what is true is whatever the person we have accepted as our Authoritarian Leader says is true.  How do we know what is the right thing to do?  Whatever our Authoritarian Leader says is the right thing to do.\n\nWhen two Authoritarian Leaders like Trump and Putin meet they will have to settle early on which of them will be the Leader and which the Follower.\n\nTrump is at a disadvantage with his Authoritarianism because he was raised in a country where we at least try to take seriously the God-given Right of every human being to \"Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\"  It's part of our common social DNA.\n\nNetanyahu's hard-core Authoritarian tendencies towards the Palestinians are well documented, despite the rather empty trappings of a democratic process to which he must show lip service.  Clearly Netanyahu has become the Authoritarian Leader in this relationship with Trump.\n\nIn the cases of the others I named, they are overtly much more hard-core as Authoritarians.  That's why Trump must wind up as the Follower in all these relationships.\n\nSo Trump is psychologically incapable of promoting U.S. interests in these relationships.",

That would be worth reading and might even do him some good if one believes confession is good for the soul.\n\nAs for the rest of the column, I see no particular insight, only repetitious boilerplate.

There is no Palestinian voter / donor bloc that matters for either of these grifters.

The Arabs lost all eight of them, and the loser doesn't get to dictate the terms.  Also to remember: the wars launched by the surrounding Arab states and Palestinians were all designated \"wars of extermination,\" war that would push the Jews \"into the sea.\"  On the Eve of the Six-Day War Arab leaders spoke of the coming slaughter of Jews as something that would rival the \"Mongolian massacres.\"  The bottom line is there cannot be peace so long as Palestinians and Arab states hold the view that Infidels can never have sovereign rights in what they refer to as \"Dar el Islam,\" the Muslim patrimony.  They will reject this peace -- they would have rejected ANY peace -- that allowed the continued existence of a Jewish state.

If pigs not only could fly but become somehow kosher while doing so?\n\nGet real.  Talk about real things; real possibilities.  Maybe the reason why you don't is that none of them are palatable?",

It continues to give Israel too much power over its neighbor, and does not create the required balances of power, resources, and sovereignty between the \"two states\" of Palestine and Israel. This is only it's most glaring fault, among other faults.\n\nThere is a stark reason why this \"deal\" was attempted in the first place, by Jarvanka Kushner who like trump has zero skills in this (or any other) area.\n\nThis so-called peace deal is nothing more than another vain attempt by trump to place his own name onto another item, as he's done his entire life with things like a vineyard, steaks, water bottles, a \"university\", and of course buildings.  However now he strives to put his \"brand\" name on a document - this \"magnanimous\" (useless) peace deal - so history will record it, and from which his name can't be erased.\n\ntrump wants his name to remain in the public eye, and he's worried his name is being removed from \"his\" buildings. We read of many buildings that had his name are now being renamed, because the residents are ashamed of being associated with such a loser. So trump is concerned that his \"legacy\", his name, is being erased.\n\nWhat better way to ensure his name stays in history, than to attach it to legislation, trade deals, and now a peace deal.\n\ntrump's delusional brain likely believes this deal is sooooo wonderful, that it may even win for him a Nobel Peace Prize, as Obama has?  (any sane person can see how jealous trump is of Obama)",

What Bibi says goes.    The Donald claims to be a great negotiator and deal maker -- but I suspect that he will end up taking whatever Bibi proposes.  Just be glad that Bibi did not say that he wants everything.\n\nFact 4:   Bibi says that Iran is evil and a tremendous threat to Israel.    Hence the Evangelicals think that Iran is evil -- hence The Donald and Pompeo think that it is evil.\n\nIf you want to know what American policy in the middle east is,   just ask Bibi.\n\nEnjoyed the article by Thomas Friedman.  He always writes good thoughtful pieces.    It is pretty much an academic exercise since The Donald and Bibi pay no attention but it is interesting to read.",

It has always been the Palestinians' maximalist demands and unwillingness to compromise that stymied the solution to this problem. Israel has always shown great flexibility and an unquestioned desire to solve the problem. Rather than now put a further onus on Netanyahu, why don't you recommend telling Abbas that it is now time to compromise and give up the Palestinians' century-old effort to eliminate the Jews from the area to establish an Islamic region \"from the river to the sea,\" as they often proclaim. One further comment is that the West Bank is not \"Palestinian land.\" It is land originally given to the Jews by the League of Nations specifically for the rebirth of a homeland for the Jewish people. One could only say that it is \"disputed territory,\" although the Palestinian claims on the West Bank have far less validity and credibility.",

There's currently NO \"Middle East Peace Process.\" It is & has been a fraud. The Palestinians are why we are here at this juncture - not Israeli settlements or anything like that. The Palestinians will never accept Israel - period. They refuse to recognize it as a Jewish state but insist that any Palestine nation be Islamic. Our European allies have kept this farce going for decades by cowardly succumbing to PLO demands such as releasing terrorists from prison whenever threatened. At this point what the Palestinians want is immaterial. Peace will only come when the Sunni Arab states tell the Palestinians the jig is up & stop supporting them. Let Jordan take a bigger role in this - it was Jordan that lost the West Bank in 1967 when it entered the war. The old \"borders of 1967\" were never borders - just armistice lines from 1949. They change. The Palestinians will have to make major concessions if they want peace. Or one day they will find themselves on the other side of the Jordan River.",

I will be the first to criticize Israel when necessary, but I would love to see an article that questions the \"leadership\" of Abbas. Where has all the money gone that is given to Abbas and Hamas? How has it helped the Palestinian people, who still live in poverty stricken environments. Why hasn't Abbas been asked what his peace plan would be for Gaza and Israel? If these questions have been asked, I have missed them. I'm sure my ears or eyes would have been on radar if they had been asked. Disappointing that hard questions are only given selectively to push one's argument. It's also interesting to me that the last four or five comments I have made in response to articles were not approved. Prior to a comment I made that was not aligned with the perspective of the Times, my approvals were given quickly, but now they have stopped.",

The future Trump State of Palestine is devoid of all substance (no army, no control over airspace and cyberspace, nothing bigger than a gpmg, security policy subject to foreign veto). And the whole economic aid plan has no specifics (not even the source of funding). Also the plan just assumes the Israelis will just maintain the status quo relating to Holy Sites in Jerusalem, with no sanctions for them deciding to demolish  Al Aqsa. And, as Mary Mcgovern said bellow, water seems to be under complete Israeli control. So not only is security policy subject to veto, but the standard of living is Israeli hands (they can just close the tap). And there are a lot of references in the plan to \"business friendly policy\" by Palestine, i.e. low taxes, severely curtailed collective bargaining rights and low labor standards (you know, republican business friendly). This to me just means the Palestinian state is starved for cash and revenue, and any money you save by not having an army will not go to healthcare and education, cause it doesn't exist, and you are again dependent on foreign humanitarian aid.\nIn my mind, this plan is dead on arrival, and designed as such, it just needs to reinforce Trumps base and keep Bibi from prison. \nPS: Yes I actually read \"THE PLAN\".",

They fully expect them to perish forever in the days of the rapture because only those who have been saved will not perish.   \n\nThis is the real reason Israel has been the largest single recipient of American foreign aid for the last half century:  No Republican can win without the fundamentalist vote.  \n\nBefore Roe v. Wade and desegregation of the public school system, the fundamentalists voted for the Democrats because they saw themselves as working class people.  They loved Roosevelt because he provided relief to farmers through the AAA and brought electricity to their homes through the REA.  Electricity gave them access to radio and other conveniences for the first time.  \n\nBut the corporations that control Christian radio have never been fond of Roosevelt's New Deal.  They found a way to steal these votes from the Democrats by getting the fundamentalists to focus the afterlife rather than their current climatic conditions on this planet.      \n\nAs a buddy to Bibi, Trump improves his chances in the 2020 election.",

First, as Mr. Friedman points out, the paln could force Israel's right wing leadership to declare publicly whether a 2-state solution is still on the table. Second, it could force the Palestinian leadership to declare whether they, in exchange for statehood, are willing to consider renounciation of all means and methods they have supported thus far to destroy the State of Israel. Third, the participation of representatives from at least 2 moderate Arab governments was in itself a major step forward; And fourth, perhaps most important, the public declaration laid open several heretofore known but unstated facts: (a) the Arabs rejected the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine (Nov 1947, Resolution 181) by attacking the newly recognized State of Israel; (b) the Arab leadership have since that time been using the Palestinian people as a pawn in the Arab-Israel conflict; and (c) the Palestinian leadership rejected several earlier peace proposals that are no longer relevant due to findings on the ground.",

No, sir, it is in reality in a hamlet called Abu Dis, to the east of East-Jerusalem, outside the ancient city. BUT!

Mueller's report described the transfer of polling data from Trump's campaign manager to a Russian representative every Wednesday morning at 9:00 AM.

People embrace master narratives which guide them in their lives. These are political ideologies, religious beliefs or moral frameworks. Micro-targeting may reinforce these master  narratives but it cannot change them. So if you want to convince large numbers of people to change their minds, you better go to the source.

Worse, our obsolete, flawed constitution has a number of well known provisions that disadvantage Democrats.  The worst is the very existence of the senate (two senators per state regardless of population) which gives about 50% of senators to 18% of voters.  Next the stupidity of giving control of federal congressional elections to states, which cheat by gerrymandering.  Next the undemocratic and obsolete electoral college.   The unfairness detailed in Edsall's article is just icing on the cake.   I concluded long ago that the idea of defeating an incumbent republican president in a good economy (which he takes undeserved credit for) is simply preposterous.

Any tax-exempt religious organization that is telling people for whom to vote is no longer a church. Churches teach morals and the Republican Party is not a moral, Christian organization.

Christians who believe it is more Christian to vote Republican because that party is doing God\u2019s work are being played by the devil. According to the Bible, Satan knows the Laws of God equally well to Jesus and better than mankind. Satan tempts us by wrapping up \u201cdoing evil\u201d in a package mixed with \u201cdoing things that are good.\u201d Satan is never performing wholly good nor wholly evil acts simultaneously. This is how the best of us are \u201ctricked\u201d into working for Satan. Likewise, this happens to political parties (and people). Both political parties do Satan\u2019s work as well as God\u2019s work. When Christians promote the Republican Party (and candidates) over the Democratic Party, and do it in the name of God or Christianity, they show they have been ensnared by the devil and their allegiance is no longer solely to God. Christians would do well to remain as independent activists for moral causes not doing the devil\u2019s dirty work by selecting one candidate or party over another. Christian\u2019s who endorse Trump are keeping the unsaved from ever coming to Christ, the Church, and Christianity, which is equally a sin.",

Even of Trump loses and the Republicans hold the majority in the Senate, the country will be at a standstill and with a hamstrung Democratic president.\nSo here it is Dems. Set aside you high minded principles of free education and healthcare for all and focus on what really matters. If we don't reclaim the White House and the senate, nothing you hope for will matter. And far worse, we will loose the Supreme Court for the rest two to three generations. Can you live with that?\nSanders or Warren will not appeal to the critical Independent and moderate Republicans.\nI miss the good ol' days of smoke filled backrooms where party bosses picked the candidates. At least they know what they were doing... sometimes.",

People caught in the pseudo-Christian megachurch total information environment. They have their own schools, media, and social clubs, and are taught that anything outside that sphere is evil.\n\nBeyond those relatively small groups, there are the \"vote blue no matter who\" (actual) Democrats and the 50% of Americans who currently don't vote but could be persuaded if the Democrats came up with some hook other than \"Trump is awful.\"",

The National Popular Vote Bill is two thirds of the way to becoming law, a law stating that all electoral votes will be given to the winner of the national popular vote, with no input needed from the federal government to bring this about. State legislatures with 196 electoral votes have already signed on and states with 74 more electoral votes are needed. The bill has been partially passed by at least one legislative chamber in 8 states possessing 75 electoral votes (AR, AZ, ME, MI, MN, NC, NV, OK) and has been unanimously approved at the committee level in 2 states possessing 27 more electoral votes (GA, MO).

Voters often chose Trump because they were afraid of illegal immigration.  But these fears are partly justified.  Open borders would increase poverty in the US and make it harder to afford the safety net that protects America's poor.  We need to be humane to illegal immigrants, but we need firm and fair immigration policies.\n\n2.  The left needs to soften its push toward \"social justice.\"  For example, the Me Too movement has taken away the rights of accused men to due process.

If Biden becomes the Democratic Nominee,Many Young and Working-class Democratic Voters Will Not Even Remember The General Election Date. It will be unexciting,uninspiring, uninteresting and low energy. Biden's online or social media presence is negligible compared to Trump or Bernie Sanders.The largest crowd that Biden has drawn to his political rallies in his entire political life was 6,000 people in Philadelphia last Summer. Compare that to Bernie Sanders 26,000 Strong Energetic Crowds in New York last October. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF ENTHUSIASM. If Biden is the Nominee and polls show him defeating Trump on paper, many Democrats and Independents will not even be energized to actually vote and they will forget to actually vote in real life just as they forget to attend his rallies. Then Trump will energize all his 45 percent supporters to polling box and win re-election. That's Exactly What Happened To Hillary 2016, and it will be insanity to repeat it again in 2020 based on Albert Einstein Advice.",

Located outside St Petersburg, which spearheaded the pro-Trump bots and disinformation and hacking and dissemination of the DNC emails.  \n\nThere's Breitbart, the digital platform for the \"Alt-Right,\" the new name for the white supremacist and neo-Nazi movement.  Trump's former White House aide is still using that platform to push far-right propaganda in behalf of Trump.  And there's the rest of right-wing corporate online media.\n\nThen there are the digital campaign organizations funded with tens of millions of unregulated dollars from the Koch family and its network of right-wing billionaires.\n\nAnd of course, one has to mention Moscow Mitch and the Senate Republicans, who have blocked every effort to pass legislation to prevent Russian digital media interference with the 2020 election.\n\nYep, Trump is far head.  And Democracy, not Democrats, is far behind.",

While the GOP has a captive and completely vertically and horizontally integrated news media pushing out a tightly scripted daily message, the Democrats are reliant on the creaky old 1975-era institution of neutral, value-free Both Sides Journalism, where the Democratic candidate is just as likely to get hammered as fairly reported on (\"but her emails!\", \"Wikileaks!\").\n\nThe ultimate net effect of the asymmetrical information warfare on the Democrat is that of discouragement and apathy. For every Democrat that gets energized and motivated by Trump's antics, another one or two simply get discouraged and give up, dropping out and disengaging from politics altogether. \n\nIn my own case, in the face of the GOP disinformation onslaught and the news media both-sidesism, which serves to publicize and legitimize all of Trump's deliberate disinformation, I have all I can do to keep myself motivated and fight the urge just to throw my hands up at it all and drop out.\n\nIt is a tragedy to watch our great experiment in liberal democratic self-government implode in a cloud of smoke, disinformation and deception.",

That system is the conservative propaganda machine, led by Fox News and supported by a rank and file of shadowy organizations that help spread the misinformation.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Democrats have all the answers and Republicans are all evil, or that Republicans generally are either gullible or liars. The danger is that millions of people, not a majority but enough to tip the scale, have willingly become the human equivalent of zombie devices, infected with pro-Trump ideological malware and spreading its misinformation payload every day. Take that factor out of the equation and you might have a competition of ideas again, but it\u2019s hard to see a way past it in our current climate.",

However, the Catholic cell pohne example has been refined for years by Jewish genius who first developed data called \"Jewish Names\"- which of course now includes Irish, Chinese, Hispanic, African American... well you get the picture. Our older generations are familiar with phone and mail-list sophistication which has almost disappeared as we knew it, yet still remains stronger than we might think because of one new set of weapons that simply jams any server working for the \"enemy\" and erases the message as if never sent by cell phone, PC, or other wired or wireless methods.  Some work has also been done to capture ads and messages and edit them in \"MidAir\" to change the meaning and message to an advert for soup or beer, or to an attack on the sender's client or worse. Thus the success by such neo data manipulation, especially in elections, can be severe especially if aimed at lower-tier races in local, state, and regional efforts. It seems to stop such impish criminal activity is improbable as it occurs out-of-country as did the Trump success via Russia, Britain, and other faraway places.

Some that didn't vote for him in 2016 have said they've switched to be a supporter.

The Democrats must get together with a strong message. A ray of home that I saw about this rally is that there were very little black voters in attendance.

And yet, he still commands very strong backing from 40%of the country, and over 60% when it comes to handling of the economy, often the most important thing in voters' minds.\n\nOn the other hand, we have seen that the more voters learn about Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders' plans, the more Democratic voters are uncomfortable with them.

To win in November, progressives, moderates, centrists and independents who don't like Trump, and even the 10 to 15% of Republicans who find him appalling, will need to coalesce around a single candidate.  Whether that is one of the progressives or one of the moderates, people are already saying they won't vote for a candidate that doesn't fit their preferences--some real people and perhaps some not.  There is an enthusiasm gap plaguing the leading moderate candidate.  Both progressives and moderates are expending lot's of energy advocating for their preferred policies, all of which will be moot if Trump wins. Then there is hobby politics, in which people go online and express opinions without talking to people face to face.  Churches are better organizing venues than newspaper comment columns.  Meantime, the hard work of getting out the vote, which includes smart use of state-of-the-art technology, is getting neglected.  If people do not coalesce around a candidate as soon as the primaries are decided, with enthusiasm & energy, there will be 4 more years of Trump.  Getting 3 million extra votes in CA won't matter. It will be decided in WI, PA, OH, NC, FL, AR, VA, MI, NH and CO.",

We can return to the Fairness Doctrine, requiring opposing views to be fairly heard and fact-checked. We can return actual news to a non-partisan, ratings-free category. We can again ban outright libel and hate speech based on race, religion, gender or national culture from the public airwaves. I think it is vital that we break up the media giants which control the slants of what is reported and the narratives that pass for news. Words have power.

It won't change the mind of one person who voted for Trump. Trump is at his best (in his mind) when he's fighting back. Impeachment hearings are being spun by Trump as a witch hunt to fair-minded voters. When impeachment fails in the Senate, he will again claim victory! Trump actually believes this debacle will facilitate his winning a 2nd term. The excessive amount of attention to this appears to be backfiring, increasing the odds that Trump will be reelected & it not being the result of Russian interference. Paradoxically what this impeachment inquiry will do is drive Biden out of the race which is what Trump wanted all along.  Fair or not Biden has been wounded. This benefits Sanders who is rising in the polls. But he will be the easier candidate to beat in 2020! The MSM has barely laid a hand on him. But when they do Sanders flounders.

Firstly, politically active and aware Americans have come to view any information received on-line with deep skepticism.  Mr. Edsall worries that this skepticism may be offset by personal mediation - information received face to face from your neighbor.  So when your Trump supporting neighbor leans over the fence to warn you of the latest crime Biden's supposedly committed you're just going to trust him on that, right?  The most important asymmetry though is intellectual.  I can concede that in 2016, an intelligent informed American with traditional, conservative views and values or an economically unjustly mistreated worker could have logically voted for Trump.  In 2020 we all know who and what Trump is.  Smart people are far less likely to be taken in by digital tricks - no matter how much money is wasted on said tricks.",

Parents see their own Children as The Best and Children see their Parents as The Best. Thus,it's easy for Republicans to see Nothing Wrong With Trump ordering a president of a sovereign country to investigate his potential political opponent before receiving aide. Also,Democrats as Members of a political family don't see Anything Wrong with Biden's Political Records,like commanding a sovereign country to remove it's Attorney General before receiving aide and Hunter Biden's $50,000 per month salary. Why? Because Members of our family are always right in our eyes. The problem is that the Independent Voters in Swing States are always more willing to give the outsider candidate like Trump the benefit of doubt,but punish an establishment career politician like Biden. That's why Independent Voters who're not members of Republican party or Democratic party in Swing States broke overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016 instead of Hillary,even though they viewed both of them as corrupt and unlikable. If Democrats really want to win in 2020,they have to learn from their mistakes in 2016 and avoid repeating the same mistake by not making Biden their presidential Nominee 2020. If Joe Biden is their nominee,the Republicans and the Media will only talk about his Bad Records as an Establishment Career Politician and his Son Hunter;just like they did to Hillary without talking about policies.",

When Silicon valley, the first generation, came about (HP, Intel, Fairchild, etc), there was an ethos there, they were known for groundbreaking engineering but they also had a sense of what their technology could bring to the world (HP is a shell of itself, at one point it produced some of the best and innovating products around). Silicon Valley II, bred in the shadows of those firms, took that technology and invented new paradigms (the personal computer, for example, the video game industry, number of other things). There was an idealism there, one where  they saw what they were producing would change the world, give people information at their fingertips, bring the power of computing home, etc......obviously, they changed over time, Jobs once believed as the others did, until his idealism went out the window with his desire to control things, to be the ultimate power in tech, others as they became corporations lost most of that. Silicon valley III, based in the internet and phone apps, never even pretended to be there for the common good, it was about stock price and gaining control.",

By moving to a paradigm where software changes are delivered multiple times per day developers can see the outcome of those changes immediately and react accordingly. The feedback loop is much tighter and you learn from mistakes (aka \"breaking stuff\") much quicker. This is why Amazon and other modern tech shops deploy software tens of thousands of times per day. \n\nWhile I am essentially disgusted with the direction Facebook has gone in the past 4-ish years it's unfortunate that many have conflated the \"break stuff\" verbiage meant for software changes with the \"breaking of american institutions\" which was never the intention of those words.

There's no intrinsic reason why business leaders in tech should be any more idealistic in practice than business leaders in fossil fuels or finance.  And it appears that they aren't.",

Mature areas, from education to refrigeration, are proclaimed \"ripe for disruption\" simply because they are large markets using mature technologies.\n\nBut Christensen didn't say \"find a mature technology serving a large market, and replace it.\"  He said that  \"disruptive\" technologies are  introduced to serve a market that  is too small or too poor to draw the attention of the big players.   Once the technology has a market, it gradually becomes more effective, drawing a larger and larger share of the market until it outcompetes and ultimately replaces the mature technology.\n\nIn other words, a disruptive technologist doesn't set out to bring down an existing industry, but to serve an unfilled need.  In a different set of hands, the idea of \"disruptive technology\" could have inspiring: it is a call to develop technologies that serve poor, disabled, or isolated people who have been overlooked by conventional industries.  It is a shame that, instead,  \"disruptive technology\" has come to mean \"let me find what I can break.\"",

Never allow a source to control the interview, or use manipulative tactics to try to put a reporter on the defensive.  (Reporters are there to hold government to account, not the other way around.) And the question \"do you think you owe an apology?\" is one of the most pointless, empty questions that journalists ask. How about, \"Critics say you . . .

Most people would expect Trump IMHO to fail miserably. I am confident that I would easily defeat him in a country location contest. It's a good test. Expose the President to it. He is an ignorant man. There is always some one thing the ignorant man knows. To the ignorant man that is the only thing worth knowing. It fills the ignorant man's universe; I am paraphrasing Joseph Conrad.\nThe one thing that Trump knows, that fills his universe, is how racists think. He is an expert; not so much where all the S hole countries are. Thank you Mr Pompeo for introducing your excellent test.",

The rather bad effort did nothing more than end the Oslo accords and less than a year later the World Trade Center came down.

Pompeo, by contrast, used the tactics of a sullen 12-year-old: unresponsiveness, unsupported assertions and emotion-drenched personal attacks to avoid engaging with legitimate questions. Contrast the pathetic behavior of our nation's top diplomat with that of the many career foreign service professionals who testified before the House Intelligence Committee.",

Nothing could be more lugubrious than these. \n\nThe diligent and industrious involvements of Mary's endeavors, especially, in matters of international importance, were repetitively rebuffed by Mike Pompeo, who continued to maintain his stance of protecting his staff, come what may. He could not answer a simple question on Marie Yovanovitch's ouster, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. His adamant approaches, to many questions posed by Mary Louise Kelly, were peppered with gasconading claims of how he handled his retinue. \n\nFinally, it appeared that Mike could not contain his indignation, and this culminated in his dudgeon towards Mary Louise Kelly, given his already well-known cantankerous behaviors in public, many times. It seems tempting to suggest that he needs a befitting requite from an apt person, yet to be discovered.",

The condemnation heaped on him is well deserved. \n\nBut I also wondered if there's an inside story that could explain his blowing up at Kelly: his reaction seemed to be touched off by the line of questions about Ukraine, and in particular, the question of whether he had acted appropriately towards Yovanovitch. \n\nIf not for the doubling-down on his rant at Kelly, I was ready to allow that, in fact, Pompeo HAD been acting to protect Yovanovitch. Her sudden recall, in light of the revelations (from Parnas) that she was being followed and surveilled by Robert Hyde, might not have been about firing her. Perhaps is was about protecting her. If--big IF--that was so, and Pompeo was scrambling behind the scenes to keep her safe, that could explain his blowing up at Kelly when she pressed him on that. It woud NOT make his outburst acceptable, but it might explain why that was a sore spot for him. \n\nBUT, no. \n\nWhen he comes out with the follow up statement calling Kelly a liar and implying she doesn't know basic geography, and if he's accepting Trump's backslap for abusing Kelly, then sympathetic readings of his bad conduct are not called for. Lump him in with the other boorish, arrogant, bullying 'boys' of Trump's ilk.",

Other family members served their country bravely and returned home.  None of them would recognize our country today.\n\nTrump, Pompeo and most of the Republicans are denigrating everything Americans have fought for over the years.  But the real problem is that too many Americans refuse to see what is right in front of them, and the threat it represents to our democracy.  When we stop laughing with these vulgar men and women, when we finally hold them to account only them will American be great again.\n\nContinue your good work, Ms. Kelly.

If we are not vigilant, we will witness the rise of a propaganda minister the likes of Josef Goebbels. And, that will not happen, period!",

Based on Marie Yovanovich's sworn testimony and resignations from the State Department because of his leadership, he surely lied about having supported all employees. I could hear him seething about being asked about this. And it's the antithesis of diplomacy to treat any person with such venom and to issue a nasty, official statement on State Department letterhead. How is it that such an angry man is heading our diplomatic corps? What a contrast in manner to our career diplomats, and how unfortunate that he's being congratulated for his behavior instead of being fired.",

First, Kelly provided the two interviews in the piece to illustrate that tough questions were asked of both. My reading of the answers for both is that one diplomat answered them more directly and one diplomat obfuscated. She never said that, and actually did point out that in some cases the diplomat from Iran reluctantly answered after additional questions. I certainly didn't need her to tell me that Pompeo was talking around questions with indirect responses; when I heard the interview right after NPR released it, his responses made me wonder where he has been for the last three years? \n\nFor those who feel this was political - well, she was interviewing two diplomats from two countries in conflict. OF COURSE, it is political. However, don't conflate political as partisan balderdash to be ignored. She didn't say anything political, nor polarizing. Pompeo never answered her questions; diplomacy is NOT spouting the one- liner you want to get on Fox news. We all need to stop making the word \"political\" a cuss word. There's only one way to do that. Put people in positions who can do the job. \n\nI'm grateful to Mary Louise Kelly for continuing to do get job, and NPR for its existence!",

He let me know he was tired of my \"bullshit\" among other things.  I did not report on that 'meeting', not because I thought it was 'off the record' but because I didn't think it added anything viewers needed to know.\nListeners did need to know about the confrontation between Kelly and Pompeo in my view because Pompeo himself elevated it to 'newsworthiness' - not because of his foul language, although that should be considered too, but because he revisited the Ukranian issue that was part of the interview.  His silly use of an unmarked map was an attempt to bolster his claim that Americans don't care about the issue. That made the conversation relevant and something people needed to know.",

Apparently, this is what we've come to--the President of the United States publicly encouraging his leading cabinet members to lie, swear and intimidate professional reporters for doing their jobs with integrity.\n\nAs an NPR anchor observed tonight, this is Trump's whole strategy:  whenever somebody asks a question that's too difficult, create a childish scene and turn the story into a personal drama about being oppressed by with what they call the \"fake news.\"\n\nWe can't let them do this.  Which is why your thoughtful reflection on these interviews is so important.  It's not about Pompeo using the \"F\" word or insulting you personally.  It's about Pompeo being an incompetent Secretary of State who's in way over his head and doesn't know what he's doing--just like his boss, the President.  And ultimately, it's about how important it is to remove both of these profoundly incompetent people from office next November.",

The next two paragraphs below are what Rush told his alleged 20 million listeners about Ms. Kelly\u2019s encounter with Pompeo (pasted verbatim from today\u2019s show transcript on Rush\u2019s website):\n\nRUSH: \u201cPompeo was lied to by the NPR reporter. He was set up twice. She promised him she was not gonna ask him about Ukraine, only Iran, and then she didn\u2019t ask anything about Iran, and then she promised him that any conversation after the interview would be off the record. She lied about both.\n\nPompeo called her out, demanded that she find Ukraine on a map, and she couldn\u2019t. The NPR reporter pointed to Bangladesh when Pompeo asked her. \u2018You\u2019re asking me all about Ukraine; you don\u2019t even know where it is. Find it for me on the map.\u2019 She thought it was where Bangladesh is. So Pompeo kicked her off his airplane because she lied to him twice and set him up in this interview and the interview conversation afterwards.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the link to this transcript (the excerpted section above is in the fifth and sixth paragraphs):\n\n<a href=\"https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2020/01/28/its-you-and-me-they-really-hate\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2020/01/28/its-you-and-me-they-really-hate</a>/\n\nI\u2019m sure Ms. Kelly is not surprised by this gross distortion of reality. This is what she (and all of us) are up against.",

After months in the German capital, he comes to believe the Nazi propaganda himself, and is completely dislocated by reality when he returns home. \n\nIn the modern world, China does not offer freedom of the press, and so the Communist Party is assured of support for its policies from news outlets. It's as if every channel is Fox News, only more supportive of the President and his policies. \n\nMike Pompeo comes across as a despicable man, and I thank Mary Louise Kelly for standing up to him, and winning at his little game of finding Ukraine.

That was fantastic journalism from Kelly, and regrettably far too rare from journalists. And all this before the swearing and misogyny from Pompeo, demanding that Kelly, like a schoolgirl in the Principal's office, identify Ukraine. And then his twisted lie about Bangladesh/Ukraine trying to embarrass her -- as a formal statement on the US State Dept. website. He tried to bully her personally and with the weight of his office, then he lied in calling her a liar, then he went completely twisted with his bizarro lie implying that she did not know where Ukraine is. Sick behavior from the Secretary of State. But in this essay, Kelly does not convey any of that. Odd, no?",

Ultimately, this portion of the voting populace is a problem we'll be dealing with for the foreseeable future.

He does not hesitate to bellow the vilest insults and descriptions of all those who oppose him.  Kelly does an excellent job of dealing with the pompous and the narcissistic, in spite of the bad mouthing she faces from Trump and his party.",

That was fantastic journalism from Kelly, and regrettably far too rare from journalists. And all this before the swearing and misogyny from Pompeo, demanding that Kelly, like a schoolgirl in the Principal's office, identify Ukraine. And then his twisted lie about Bangladesh/Ukraine trying to embarrass her -- as a formal statement on the US State Dept. website. He tried to bully her personally and with the weight of his office, then he lied in calling her a liar, then he went completely twisted with his bizarro lie implying that she did not know where Ukraine is.

Trump - mostly, what the most affective way would be to defeat him. Now I wonder and worry about the psychology of those who work around Trump.\n\nIf there is a \u201ccancer\u201d in this White House, it is Donald J. Trump. And if working near him doesn\u2019t affect those who do, they are similarly psychotic and cancerous.\n\nLet us all pray, then, for Mike Pompeo and all of those working in Trump\u2019s White House. The years of psychotherapy they will need afterwards will be immense. And if not, Then we should pray for them all the more and forgive them, for in their psychosis they know not what they do.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s say a prayer for our country and the world.

He didn\u2019t resign and object to Trump\u2019s conduct, but tolerated and enabled Trump\u2019s abuse of power and by that alone participated in that criminal act. Pompeo must be forced to resign now and take responsibility for his moral and ethical failures. In my opinion what Pompeo allowed to happen may be criminal and if so he should face justice in the courts. His political career should be over and he should not get away with his despicable conduct and arrogant self denials.",

Then Trump and his ilk wonder why they receive negative press coverage? They do treat female journalists differently than they do males, especially if women ask tough questions.

Considering I deal with a CEO, to a homeless, to a drug addict, to a student, as patients in the same day\u2014 we have to be good or otherwise delivery of medical care would be impossible. \nThe minute I heard that interview, even before I read what happened afterwards\u2014I said to a colleague\u2014 name of God, that man is hostile, he would chew her out if he could. \nI was saddened to hear that\u2019s exactly what SOS did, when the same colleague texted me a link to news! \n\nThis should further alarm moderate Republicans\u2014 I have no hopes from Trump supporters, for they\u2019re a lost cause!\nWhen you harass, insult and obstruct free journalism, these are the first steps to an autocratic state. To wit: Russia, China, Turkey. \nNeed I go on!",

It is also a fact, that the citizens of this country paid for our education through their taxes, and for that fact alone, we owe our nation a significant debt of gratitude. To treat all people in an honorable manner is not too much to ask. Secretary Pompeo has failed the American people and all of his fellow graduates.",

Attack on Iran. Trump and Pompeo are searching for an excuse to claim provocation. It won't take much...maybe Trump will order a launch of missiles after Bibi tells him Iran was behind the exposure of his corruption and his difficulty getting reelected. Exposure of corruption affecting reelection is not something Trump takes lightly. A war would achieve both a diversion and perhaps an election boost. Besides, Pompeo has been wanting a war with Iran long before he joined the Trump League of the Infamous and Unprincipled.\n\nAmerica, we know one thing is certain: Trump will act on his personal interests, not those of your sons and daughters.",

Try to sneak in a curve ball or two and hope to keep the batter off guard. So, at the end of the at bat, Kelly throws one high and inside. Pompeo swung and missed. The pitch didn't come close to hitting Pompeo.  He could of stepped out of the batter's box, glared at Kelly, said something to the umpire, and walked back to the dugout.  Instead he charged the mound, acted like a wild man, and tried to intimidate her.  Just like his mentor Trump does.  So here is my advice to Pompeo:  Stop being a baby.  You look like an angry, vindictive, intolerant person. Also just like Trump.  Tough questions, like tough pitches, are all part of the game.

He might have said that he was working on a new nuclear deal far tougher than the Obama deal. And so on. But with a reporter from that \"liberal\" NPR, he was dismissive. He had no intention of shedding light on the most pressing national security question facing this country.

For I have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully informed.\n\nI not only could not stifle controversy among your readers\u2014I welcome it. This Administration intends to be candid about its errors; for, as a wise man once said: \u201cAn error doesn\u2019t become a mistake until you refuse to correct it.\u201d We intend to accept full responsibility for our errors; and we expect you to point them out when we miss them.\n\nWithout debate, without criticism, no Administration and no country can succeed\u2014and no republic can survive. That is why the Athenian law-maker Solon decreed it a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy.

I called her office this week to complain, once again, and her staff told me she was interviewing as we spoke with an AM radio station in the district.  I said, AM radio?  I don\u2019t think my radio has AM!  Stefanik will continue to mislead and claim that interview on AM counts, her hundreds of unannounced appearances before screened constituents count, and a half dozen screened calls per year for \u201ctelephone town halls\u201d count.   They do not count.  We need some new representation.  We need someone who will interview with our district wide NPR station monthly if not more and has in person town halls in every county yearly if nor more.",

It's even scarier to think Trump may be the more stable (or chicken) one compared to Pompeo.\n\nPompeo is also under tremendous pressure what with his probable complicity in the Ukrainian shakedown and his abdication of State Dept leadership when he abandoned ambassador Marie Yovanovich in Kiev.  \n\nI do think we can dispense with Pompeo's pseudo-evangelicalism. His religious convictions seem to be manifested by a total lack of honesty and Christian charity. Instead he appears determined to bring on Armageddon and the second coming, hence the fawning over Israel's right wing government.\n\nThis most recent episode highlights the gross dysfunction in the Trump administration.

His attitude was not that of a professional diplomat, but of a viceroy, whose words and deeds are not subject to public scrutiny. I suspect Pompeo might have been angry with you over your persistent questions on Iran, even if you hadn\u2019t gone on to asking reasonable questions about Ukraine. Keep up the great work!",

I'm an atheist but I occasionally listen as it examines some interesting ethical quandaries around the globe. I could barely believe it when the host, at the start of this particular episode, announced he would be talking with the U.S. Secretary of State about the Israel-Palestine issue. I thought why would any Secretary of State be bothering with some Australian radio show that almost no-one listens to. The answer was obvious - much like Trump, Pompeo enjoys a little ego-stroking. Unfortunately it all went pear-shaped fairly quickly when the host quickly dispensed with the Israel questions and moved on to the many ethical transgressions of the Trump administration (most prominently, the family separation policy). Pompeo grew very testy and irritated as the host continued to pepper him with inconvenient questions, until Pompeo abruptly ended the interview in a barely controlled rage. For me it was a very humorous and enjoyable 5 or 10 minutes, and confirmed my suspicions that Pompeo is a egotist hack in way over his head. Search religion and ethics report and you should be able to find the interview in its archives. It's a hoot.",

Her work is more important now than it has been for decades. The codified and uncodified irreplaceable institutions of our democracy are suffering irreparable damage at the hands of Pompeo and Barr and McConnell and the textbook demagogue whom they are all serving hand and foot--mendaciously, immorally, opportunistically. They are shamelessly attacking Ms. Kelly's own free press with the very same words and phrases that Stalin and Goebbels once used. On some days it seems as if the free press is the only thing that stands between us and their dreams of a regime in which the only things that matter are white conservative dominance, entitlement and prerogatives. It goes without saying whom we must believe here. How many tens of thousands of documented falsehoods have come out of this White House?",

The local franchises do annual fund raising but most of the money does not come from the listeners.  They do a very good job of convincing listeners that they are indeed funding NPR.  Today you could say 'NPR' stands for \"Neoliberal Propaganda Radio. I dumped them out of a frustration at NPR's always stilted anti-middle class coverage.  They rarely cover anything that is of interest to the actual $50,000 middle class, not the $300,000 top 10% tenured academia, Physicians and Lawyer crowd whose income is hermetically sealed off from any economic ravages of the 'free market' and H1-B visas.  They have always shilled consistently for the Corporate Democrat which currently includes a self-imposed sotto-voce  on Bernie Sanders.    It is not surprising that Pompeo treated Mary Louise Kelly the way he did.    NPR reporters are highly paid Washington swamp elitists save a few old timers like Peter Overby who are kept on to supply versimilitude.  Some like Mara Liasson moonlight on Fox News.  NPR hews closely to the supposed \"middle\".  They are complicit along with the rest of the elitist media for ignoring the real middle class in this country.  Maybe they should have allowed Steve Inskeep to interview Pompeo.  Nobody does 'ingratiating and obsequious' like Steve.",

The subject of Ukraine has special sensitivity among many in Trump's senior advisors. It has taken its toll and although well intended and justified, the Ukraine question finally touched a raw nerve where Pompeo is  complicit in a monumental lie in spite of his own advice on the subject (Reference: Bolton's book manuscript).

However, N.P.R. would not let us cut out their ads, which they call \"underwriting\" as a sanitized euphemism, also arguably \"fake news.\"",

Treat them as a criminals that they are and ask them real tough questions.",

Our country has been overtaken by rude, malicious, evil men.  The party of Mitch McConnell has given up any semblance of decency and justice.  There aren't necessarily two sides to every story. If nothing else, the impeachment trial has shown us that.  Trump is clearly guilty, the Republicans' defense was laughable, and his acquittal will not make him innocent or deserving of his office. Please, NPR, we need you to be the voice of sanity and decency and good citizenship.  It's time to question the motives and principles of the GOP.  America needs you.

The problem is HE is the diplomat supposed to avoid the use of America's extremely disproportionate military strength. Mr. Esper ends up having to play the moderate.\n\n2. Ms. Kelly needs to get out of her sense of self-importance and fake sense of neutrality. The man behaved in an uncouth manner, cursed her out and the accused her of lying, no need to act like it was nothing, and that you are more worried about US Iran relations instead. Calling a bully and a dissembling liar, or at least his conduct as such. Say it is unacceptable in a civilized democratic repulic like the United States. Stop acting like some abused domestic partner and use your agency as a free citizen.\n\n3. Freedom of the press is not a unique right extended to \"journalists\" or \"reporters\". They are the most common professions protected by that right. Freedom of the press literally means the freedom to print your \"speech\" and distribute it as far and as wide as you want and can without hindrance from the government or others. It covered everyone who availed the service of a printing press to make pamphlets and posters to spread their ideas and thoughts. Please always remember that broad intent of that right.",

Worse, he is backed by a boss and an establishment in the Administration and Congress that treats the press as enemies when they dare question misleading comments and outright lies.  It appears that Pompeo got flustered when challenged-- the scary thing is that if he can't keep his cool with an NPR reporter (no offense, but it's not exactly Hard Talk), then one can only imagine his inability to lead contentious diplomatic talks.  No wonder we are where are with Pompeo at the helm of the State Department.  Makes you miss Rex a little bit... he too was inept, but at least he kept quiet.",

He also perpetuated Donald Trump's ongoing effort to discredit the news media.  \nTrump has eliminated presidential press conferences, pretending his Twitter propaganda is a substitute.  If legitimate reporters can't question the administration, how do we get any information?  And now another NPR reporter has been blocked from accompanying Pompeo on an overseas trip.  This looks like petty retaliation, but it's an abrogation of freedom of the press, pure and simple. \nThe Secretary of State also actually asked \"Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?  Well yes, a lot of us certainly do, Mr. Pompeo.  The fact that Russian President Putin annexed Crimea, which is part of Ukraine, in defiance of international law almost six years ago matters, and the fact that Putin still wants to take over the rest of Ukraine matters too.  Then there is the reality that Ukraine is a linchpin of the impeachment  trial now taking place in the Senate. \nMr. Pompeo alleges that Mary Louise Kelly, a Harvard and Cambridge graduate with a Masters in European studies and experience as an international reporter, couldn't find Ukraine on a map.  This claim reflects more on his intelligence than hers.  It's the same kind of intelligence that claimed Iraqis would greet us as liberators back in 2003: arrogant and uninformed.",

And reporters and politicians feed ignorance as much as inform. \n\nFor example, how many Americans call the country \"the Ukraine\" and/or spell its capital as \"Kiev\"? How many Americans could find the country on a map?\n\nMore specifically, how many Americans know why the separatists in the Donbass region are fighting for more autonomy? The Donbass region has close ties to Russia that were threatened when the pro-Russian president of Ukraine was overthrown in a violent coup d'etat and had to flee for his life. How many Americans know that? \n\nHow many people know that the then Autonomous Republic of Crimea was only loosely linked to Ukraine? Crimea had its own laws and own government, and the main connection with Ukraine was the subsidy that Crimea received. The media often says that Russia invaded and now occupies Crimea but in fact there was no invasion. The great majority of Crimeans wanted to join Russia and are happy to be there. Only 2% said in a poll that they want to go back. \n\nI don't mean to denigrate Ukraine and Ukrainians. They are a proud people, though poor, and have suffered under a corrupt government. They need and deserve our help. But it is a complex situation, and one that France and Germany are trying to help with, but we for the most part aren't. \n\nMost Americans neither know about Ukraine nor, with all the trouble in the world, care.",

Having been involved in roles over the years which have offered or required press interviews, I have learned that the supposed benefits are far outweighed by the downside.   Years ago, the most popular magazine at the time published a picture of my partners in a demeaning pose, disrespect a client environment at time we were in our early 20's (at a time when youth in business was not an asset).  The only problem is that it was a staged photo with a group of models and not us.  They had simply lied. It may seem harmless but there was no recourse.  Later, we've had simply false articles published in places like the Atlantic that caused real damage.  Again, lawyers indicated that the first Amendent protections were simply too great to force even a retraction much less damages.  The Press' lack of policing it's own has created the exact environment that we find ourselves in.   The Press' right to exist and protection to report without regard to truth may be absolute but it has no right to expect support for its behaviors until it demonstrates responsible journalism.  Unfortunately, good journalists like Ms Kelly will suffer as long as she is in a profession filled with the untrustworthy.",

He seems more concerned with a critical US press than the war we just avoided. This point is more important than finding Ukraine on a map.\n\nPompeo's attitude is characteristic of the Trump administration more generally though. The White House is so busy feeling persecuted, they don't bother to do a good job. Mistakes and missed opportunities abound. Trump's foreign policy, as much as he considers foreign policy at all, is merely an extension of his domestic PR campaign. He's alternatively scoring points with his base, attacking the media and/or disrupting the news cycle.\n\nWhen Pompeo says, \"we'll stop them,\" you don't get the feeling the White House is simply guarding delicate intelligence information. You get the feeling the Trump administration has no idea how to stop them so Pompeo can't answer the question. Soleimani's death was an orchestrated political stunt.

Did he not know that as a national security correspondent she reported on the most complicated global issues every day, and was always prepared and able to hold her own with world leaders?\n\nThe fact that he has an unlabeled map at the ready suggests he\u2019s pulled that trick before, but I\u2019m guessing he surrounds himself with people who usually fail the test.  When the Secretary of State suggested in a statement the next day that the country she actually pointed to was Bangladesh, he or his staff didn\u2019t even think to give the lie some credibility by saying it was Romania or Belarus or some other neighboring country.  Instead they pick a country some 3,000 miles away from the Ukraine making me wonder if Pompeo can find Bangladesh on a map.\n\nHowever what most concerned me about the interview was that the Secretary of State of the United States was unable to even deflect or dodge questions like most diplomats would.  Just a few minutes in it was clear he was in over his head and while he at least was aware enough to quickly get up and leave it begs the question:  If Pompeo can\u2019t make it through a short interview without falling apart how can we expect him to be able to negotiate behind closed doors with world leaders and not get taken advantage of?",

And honestly, II don't think any conversation a Cabinet official has with a reporter is \"off the record\" or should be, and no such conversation is actually \"private\" in any real meaning of the term.  Miler Pompeo is a poorly equipped Secretary of State, and he brings into his work a far right ideology driven by his and Barr's old-boy-network Catholicism.  He doesn't answer questions and doesn't believe that reporters work for us.  And they do, and people in power, we've always been told in our civics class and our best movies, owe it to the rest of us, who have entrusted them with power, to put up with the noxious bother of the press.  What strikes me most is how much better the press is at their job than Trump's cabinet officials are at theirs.  This is a time of extraordinary journalism, and we need to keep supporting journalists and giving them the benefit of the doubt.  After all, Trump's response to this story was to say that we should get rid of NPR.  That's what we're dealing with, and I'm grateful to every honest, fact based journalist out there helping our public life stay afloat.",

Mike Pompeo panicked and hurled verbal abuse towards Kelly precisely because at some basic level he actually does care about people like Marie Yovanovitch. \n\nBut I'm no Pompeo apologist. Make no mistake, Mike Pompeo is - like many political appointments - a walking contradiction. Simply put, Pompeo cares more about himself than he does about Marie Yovanovitch. Such choices are not free - they eventually and invariably must come at a heavy price.\n\nMary Louise Kelly did what good journalists do; she held Pompeo to account and enforced an early collection of his moral and professional debt. Only when pushy people like Kelly ask the uncomfortable questions is it even remotely possible for the free press to function as an integral component of a free and open democratic society. \n\nSo, a big thank-you to Mary Louise Kelly for being such a bleeping-pushy pain in the rear journalist who is not afraid to stick her neck out for the rest of us.",

I attribute it to his realization that his reputation and belief in his own rectitude won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t survive Trump. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessing the bargain he made and understanding how completely his ambition eclipsed his integrity.

In spite of that fact, Zarif had respect for the job Ms. Kelly was doing, and he was, at all times, civil with her.\n\nPompeo, on the other hand, is either so terrified of his boss, Donald Trump, or so inexperienced in real diplomacy or such a misogynist, that he behaved like an ass.\n\nContrary to the revisionist history which Donald Trump wishes to create in every area of foreign policy, when Trump unexpectedly won the presidency, there had been significant successes by Barack Obama with Iran and with Ukraine. \n\nInstead of building on those successes, Trump has chosen to demoralize the U.S. diplomatic corps and to reject the warnings and advice of the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nMary Louise Kelly, a gifted, brave and honest reporter, does her job well, and we are lucky to have her.",

Relatively smart, a hard worker, good at figuring out just what classes to take and who to know and what to do to get to the head of his class at West Point, which is as good as getting your ticket stamped to get into Harvard. The problem is you can do all this and be totally incapable of synthesizing complex information, having any empathy or courage, or showing any real leadership, i.e being intelligent in the real world. This is consistent with Pompeo being a mediocre businessman (and way behind many of his classmates in this regard), a back bencher in Congress, but blustering his way into Ol' Bone Spurs administration. Suddenly, you realize you are expected to be a leader in the greatest country on Earth, and realize you are not even close to being up to the task.

But she emailed Pompeo before the interview to explicitly state that they would discuss Ukraine. So Pompeo is a liar who then violated freedom of the press protections by retaliating against Michele Kelleman, who generally happens to be both thorough and nonconfrontational in her reporting. Thus we see that there is virtually no difference between Pompeo and a minister of misinformation of some banana republic.",

As such, answering a reporter's questions is not an option, it is a mandate in that our democracy functions best when the people are informed. The free press, as enshrined in the First Amendment, is the means by which we, the people, can learn from our government officials who are employed by us and paid by our taxes.  Informing the public by answering questions is an essential part of the job.  If Mr. Pompeo doesn't like the questions, he should either read the Constitution to learn his proper place, or resign from the job if he is so discomfited. The fact that he chooses to curse at a reporter demonstrates that he is clearly not competent for the job.  It is astonishing to me that someone who graduated from West Point (on my dime) and attended law school at Harvard could not have learned these things that I learned in public school.",

Being challenged and criticized is part of the job of a president and the rest of his administration.  \nEarlier today, we learned that Pompeo excluded another NPR reporter from going on  his trip to Ukraine, which was followed by the icing on the cake--Trump praising Pompeo for mistreating a journalist for doing her job.  A book can and probably has been written about the dysfunctional qualities of this administration and their license to insult and berate anyone of their choosing.  What bothers me more, however, is that there is a significant part of our electorate who still finds absolutely nothing wrong with the behavior or these men who purport to be the country's leaders.  I will waste no more time on a screed about the damage FOX news has done to our country, but I do know for sure that a country without a free press cannot be a democracy and that if one voice--be it the president's voice or a TV network is regarded as the only arbiter of truth, we're lost.",

I seem to recall you asking tough questions to many leaders that you have interviewed, whether they were Democrats, Republicans, allies of the US, or adversaries.  \n\nWhile it is always easy for the laity to say to you just keep doing what you are doing in spite of the inappropriate treatment you received by Pompeo, such a statement diminishes your work, it\u2019s impact, and the greater role of a free press in the US. After all, Pompeo\u2019s boss labeled the press early on in his tenure as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d. Furthermore, the response that Mr Pompeo  perseverated for days after you left his office, is the same default response every member of this administration claims when a question is asked of them when a lie is told: the press is always biased, it\u2019s unhinged. \n\nThe final issue is that Pompeo claims he is an Evangelical Christian. Funny how that works out for him when he\u2019s asked about something he did that was definitely wrong and I dare say was immoral. You were clearly on solid footing to ask this self-aggrandized Christian if an apology was in order to Marie Yavanovitch, because it was in order, and Pompeo was wrong not to do apologize. \n\nI\u2019d say that the press is not the enemy of the people, instead the enemy \u201cis\u201d trump, pompeo, pence, and barr.",

Tortured, held for 5 and 1/2 years, and refused to be returned to US until his buddies were released, too.\n\nPolitical Service:\n\nMike Pompeo: Congressman from Kansas. Director of Central Intelligence Agency. Secretary of State.\n\nJohn McCain: Senator from Arizona.\n\nCharacter:\n\nMike Pompeo: Trumpets his Christian Faith. Very loyal to President Trump. Allowed the Three Amigos to undercut ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Prone to anger. Attacks press with profanity in private, and with false statements in public.\n\nJohn McCain: Not fun to be around when he was angry. Had a gift for self-reflection, and publicly and privately apologized to many persons, including anti-war protestors whom he first berated, and then later befriended. Eulogized by Barack Obama. Legendary availability to reporters.\n\nEpitaph:\n\nMike Pompeo: Intelligent, sychophantic blowhard.\n\nJohn McCain: Beloved, heroic Mensch.",

Lies accelerate at the speed of fear, prejudice and hate.  \n\nSocial contagion is deadly for people but also for democracy predicated on majority consent for legitimate authority.  \n\nPanic and social fear can also be measured by inequality: poor people have fewer options other than hoping for the best. It's ironic that the people of India can vote but don't have access to basic sanitation such as toilets. Unsaid of course is access to affordable medical care, malnutrition, and lack of agency in the face of danger.\n\nAmerica's homophobia dismissed the gravity of HIV/AIDS because it was \"gay cancer\" until we learned it wasn't. Drug addiction wasn't a crisis until it wasn't just Blacks in the hood dying from overdoses and criminalization.\n\nIt's telling that we say something goes \"viral\" when it spreads instantly online.  Viral on social media is the ka-ching sound that's music to the ears of Zuckerberg, Dorsey and other billionaires that own the big digital pipelines. They make more from electrifying lies than accepting responsibility for their greed.\n\nIf Zuckerberg could patent pandemics he would.",

The emergence of the virus within China feeds a long held stigma that Chinese people are \u201cdirty\u201d and to some extent \u201cbarbaric\u201d through the consumption of non traditional animals by certain groups (particularly in the south) of the country. People must realize that this outbreak could have occurred in any of the numerous countries (including the US) where certain groups consume meat from unconventional sources. By all accounts, the growing panic toward the virus (which has been proven less virulent than the flu) only underscores the power of these biases. More recently, reports have come out that people are questioning whether Chinese products purchased on Amazon contain the virus. Certainly the threat of the coronavirus should be taken seriously, but that can be done with stigmatizing and slandering an entire country of people.",

Three of the four states with the highest turnout rates in 2016 were caucus states. It is worth understanding why that is.\n\nWhile most of us think of the caucuses purely in terms of the process of picking the presidential nominees of their respective parties, they have other business. Caucuses are also places where issue resolutions may be voted on, and more importantly, where the precinct leaders who will in turn elect district and statewide leaders are elected.\n\nWhat this means is that the political parties in caucus states are MUCH more democratic and accountable to their rank and file memberships. They are much less effectively dominated by machines.\n\nCaucuses ask more of their participants than primaries do and this generally favors the people who have the means as well as the inclination to be politically engaged. This is a a real problem. But its one that could be addressed fairly easily by making election days holidays and/or making participation in them mandatory as is done in many other countries.",

Closed ballot people maintain group pressure suppresses private opinions. Open ballot people maintain it should. What good is a scarlet letter if no one can see it. How many votes do you think Trump would have lost if the general election were an open ballot?\n\nSee how many young men will vote for Trump when their grandmother is standing there watching them. Conversely, see how many grandparents will object to climate change when their grandchildren are standing there watching them.\n\nPrivate ballots are appropriate in some circumstances but not all circumstances.

For example, those of us who are brown-skinned minorities understand the rise of groups such as the Proud Boys, and see white nationalism unchecked.\n\nWhat does this have to do with posting something online? Here's an example. Some time back I posted a comment on the NYTimes regarding a report on a recent Supreme Court decision. I've been an attorney for forty years, and I believed that the writer had missed a significant point about the decision. I posted this comment under a pseudonym.\n\nShortly thereafter, a NYTimes editor emailed me, and mentioned that I'd made an important point, and asked whether I would submit my comments as a letter to the Times. However, the editor also told me that I would need to use my real name and the city where I lived. \n\nI'm a person of color (Middle Eastern ancestry) with an obvious Middle Eastern name. I live in a very Red state. Given this administration's nod to militant white nationalist extremists, I knew that I would be doing nothing but making myself a target for the more extreme Trumpists. And I have not only my own safety to think about, but that of my family's as well. \n\nMany of us who are neither white nor Christian understand that we are no longer safe in Trump's America. And the last thing we would do is to identify ourselves online - which is nothing more than placing a target on our backs.",

Every news organization has a robust social media staff to tweet out the content of the sites. Did Ms. Sonmez not know this, and felt she had to step in to the readers' rescue?

Now, any hint that a reporter's actions might threaten the relationship with an advertising customer has to come into consideration. Baron once took on the Catholic Church in Boston; now he knee jerks, without explanation, over a tweet?\n\nAll to say, this is not just about whether and how a reporter's engagement with social media impacts the news or colleagues' work. It also bears on the fragile economic conditions newspapers deal with, an issue that has gone well past profitability and into becoming an existential threat. No advertisers, no money; no money, no newspaper.\n\nIt's important to work to understand how reporters and newspapers executives act and respond in this new world, where the power and freedom of the press, once revered for holding a place in the Constitution, now can be threatened by on-line trolls.

Under Marty Baron (with Jeff Bezos\u2019s money) WaPo won Pulitzers for reporting on Trump and the Access Hollywood tape and for reporting on sexual misconduct allegations against Roy Moore. Baron was Boston Globe editor when it won a Pulitzer for exposing clergy sexual abuse. For him to criticize a WaPo journalist for reminding the public about rape allegations against Bryant (which he essentially admitted) is both odd and unbelievable, to put it mildly. If Harvey Weinstein dies while Baron is editor, will WaPo lead its reporting on the major films he produced and will Baron lambast a reporter who separately notes the rape allegations? Two serious questions about Sonmez\u2019s suspension - was Bezos involved, and was her tweet criticized because Bryant was an African-American?",

This protocol is vital in a breaking news story when it may be difficult to pin down what really happened. When Kobe died the headline was: A Sports Icon is Dead. America Mourns. That was the story. Period. Anything that didn't hew to that line was way off-message. Criminal charges against Kobe that were dropped in 2004 and a civil suit that was settled out of court could have & should have been addressed the next day. The problem with Twitter is it allows reporters to freelance with no oversight. There was nothing wrong with Ms. Sonmez tweeting the link to a 2016 article from The Daily Beast. But her timing was terrible. That's why you have editors. Someone has to be the adult in the room. Someone has to see the bigger picture. That's responsible journalism.",

The first belongs to those who have been invited to share it for mutual strength and support, to grow a movement, etc.; the other, the main story, belongs to millions.

Fire her. The Post's dance on suspending Ms Sonmez was sad at best, but the reason they should eventually fire her is pretty obvious. Although, she has insulated herself with the new teflon cover and cannot fired.\n\nHer defense is self serving and ducking the real issues at hand and due to her obvious skilled use of social media, should have certainly known what the negative response would be. Claiming troll victimhood while wading in that pond is disingenuous. \n\nClaiming shock at the replies and threats should be reason to not have her on staff. To think that it is clever to pick that issue in Kobe's past within mere hours of his death shows bad journalistic judgement.",

One or more accusations is enough, and how dare you question the veracity of or motivation behind them!\n\nAdd to this the instant ferocity and almost lynch-mob mentality of social media (at its worst).

Even if it could be proven, the bad timing and insensitivity of such a claim shows--not the accused, but the accuser--to be the predator.",

No, but it will slow these attacks.\n\nAlso, Bryant's legacy should be questioned. His alleged rape was plead down and there was a charge of imprisonment. This is probably not a good guy we are eulogizing. It's one thing to have infidelities, it's another to be violent about it. But because he could make baskets, he got a free pass for it. Not only that, the victim in Colorado was sent thousands of death threats and not one person was convicted for making those threats. Again, social media has no consequences as the likes of Zuckerberg just laugh all the way to the bank.\n\nIdentify, locate, and arrest the online attackers.

(Social media is a cesspool and should be outlawed.)  Journalists should not be engaging in partisan commentary, nor should they actively engage in culture wars on social media in a desperate chance to get noticed and have a job.  Seeking exposure in this way often involves maximizing virality and outrage.  This undermines the integrity and reliability of journalism.  We all know you are trying to get attention on the internet.  I honestly think the New York Times and all modern news IS fake news.  You just want my eyeballs and to control my opinions, I can't trust a word you say.\n\nIt's simple.  Do the news.  Not commentary or social media.  Just the news.

Instead of apologizing over her ghoulish behavior, she claimed she got over 10,000 (!) death threats, yet her screenshots of the emails didn't show a single one.

            "comment_body": "The tactic favored by culture war trolls is called concern trolling. They pose as concerned individuals bringing issues to authorities, often as many concerned individuals, since anonymity provided by the web allows each troll to masquerade as a whole host of people, creating the illusion of mass outrage. Troll brigades can be as small as a handful or consist of scores, even hundreds of loosely affiliated people, but their ability to misrepresent their numbers means even a small group can have the same effect as hundreds if not thousands of angry people in the eyes of traditional media.\n\nThis tactic exploits the concern of people in authority. Concern for their organization's reputation, brand, and legal liability. The trolls leverage this concern by framing the actions of the targeted person (e.g. a journalist) as a risk to the organization. Thus, the heavy hand of management falls as a fist upon the target, censuring them on behalf of the trolls whilst thinking it was acting in self preservation.\n\nCountering this requires moderating responses to reports with the realization that the internet can magnify the voices of small, niche groups to give them outsized presence. If trolls see that their reporting no longer results in corporate overreactions it will lose its power as a weapon.\n\nThe goal of the trolls is to sabotage discourse in spaces where they are unwelcome. Keeping the discourse going is how you defeat them.",

When the president posts a hateful tweet and the Times includes it verbatim in an article, I skip the tweet and look instead for the analyses of its effect.

It's questionable how many on social media vote. My two stepsons and stepdaughter are very vocal about politics on-line but none of them have ever voted in primaries or elections to-date.

Maybe. \n\nBut notwithstanding the double standard by race, there is the fact of the double standards of income, career, popularity and gender that also exist here -- standards not yet solidified.\n\nThe journalist repeated what is known in the historical record. As a historical writer and researcher, I cannot encourage errors and omissions to conveniently revise history to protect the innocent and the young. By the same token, I find this reporter's conduct crass and crude. Did you really have to go there when and how you did?",

The charges were dropped and a civil case was settled out of court.\n\nDid Sonmez have the right to post that story on Twitter? Of course she did; but that is not the issue to me. \n\nI understand a big story can bring out the worst in some people, causing them to jump into the conversation whether they have something worthwhile to add or not.\n\nSonmez's thoughtless Tweet added nothing new to the conversation and appeared to be another example of the popular, finger pointing 'but,what-about-this?' trend on social media.\n\nI don't expect every reporter to weep over the death of Kobe Bryant, but I do expect basic human sensibilities, decency, respect for the pain and grief of a wife and mother, of siblings left behind. \n\nMs. Sonmez and many other reporters today, might consider taking a moment before they toss things out into the digital world. \n\nOf what value is their post? Does it contribute anything to the story, add depth or nuance? Or does dredging up old scandals at a time of death and a family's loss simply accomplish that one shining goal - keeping their own name in the news?",

I recall one night that I went downtown to meet her for supper. She allowed she would be late. It seems Harry Truman had died right on deadline. I went upstairs, and watched her tear that day's paper apart and put it back together again. Check with the obit and photo editors. Call the pressroom and tell them to set up for a flysheet to make room for two more pages. It took her 45 minutes. \nMore to the point, at The Post, in an earlier and similar role at The Evening Star, and as Assistant Managing Editor at the Washington Times (How's that for diversity of editorial pages?) she was a journalist. \nShe had no tolerance for opinion on her news pages. The first opinion a reporter wrote in would be edited out. Any protest, there would be a motherly talk. Third offense, a trip to the woodshed. \nYes, in the current environment, with the news and social media sharing a platform, there are new considerations, and it can be a fine line.

            "comment_body": "I'm no Kobe fan, but what bothered me about Sonmez's actions was that she was trying to make the story about her and hide behind a cloak of journalism. She retweeted the Daily Beast story without providing any context. She alluded to her own experience as a sexual assault survivor as the reason for the tweets. Anyone who followed his career was already aware of the 2003 case, so it wasn't like she was breaking news. (I wouldn't have suspended her, but a harsh reprimand was definitely warranted.)\n\nWhatever happened that night is a part of Kobe's life story, but it becomes a problem when people try to relitigate a matter that's already been settled in a court of law (regardless of whether or not you like the outcome). Whenever people brought this up, was it out of concern for the alleged victim ... or was it an opportunity to grandstand at the expense of her pain and suffering? (I see you, Abigail Disney!) If it's the former, context, nuance, and tact MUST be applied (and social media probably isn't the best platform, as Sonmez learned the hard way). If it's the latter, chances are you're not doing the woman any favors. Either way, Kobe could only receive forgiveness from two sources: the accuser and God. It wasn't Sonmez's place (nor anyone else's) to play judge, jury, and executioner -- that's what led to the suspension in the first place).\n\nThe bottom line remains he and eight other people died on Sunday; the focus should be on learning more about the cause of the accident.",

The fantasy behind this piece seems to be that Harvard money is supporting fossil fuel companies, and that withdrawing that money would defund such companies and diminish fossil fuel production. This is pure fantasy. Harvard students should understand that the world doesn't work that way. As others have pointed out, divesting means selling the owned shares to other investors. Nothing would change for the companies except the names on the stock certificates and the payees on the dividend checks. I guess the idea is that any investment income Harvard realizes from these companies is \"dirty money\" and ethically tainted. As others also pointed out, a lot of money can be considered \"dirty\" in that sense. One hopes, at least, that Harvard will use its funds for noble purposes such as nurturing the scientific minds and supporting the scientific research that will eventually eliminate our dependence on pollution-generating, non-renewable energy sources. This is the kind of \"money laundering\" the world needs. And what will the investors who acquire Harvard's shares use their money for?",

Agriculture, mining and extraction of resources, transport of goods, domestic and international trade, any movement of goods over water or roads or rails, distribution to retail stores, shopping, and/or parcel delivery to homes is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels. In most of the US it is impossible to go anywhere or do anything without fossil fuels. And the economy that fossil fuels support props up the banks and the investment markets. US foreign policy is clearly driven by this global stake in fossil fuel resources, we spend trillions each year, endure wars, terrorist attacks, and meddle in the affairs of countries across the globe, all of it just to keep fossil fuels flowing. And the US government isn't about to stop its plethora of heavy subsidies for fossil fuels, either. So how does one even begin to think about divestment in fossil fuels? Doesn't this require divestment in the entire global economy? Doesn't it require divestment in our own government?",

In fact, I'm rather cynical about the changes that other universities claim to have made, because they're always defined in such a way as to leave them with outs that mean that the changes are unimportant.  For example, as Paul Krugman regularly reminds us, the U.S. coal industry is on life support.  Investing in coal is a bad idea purely from the standpoint of maximizing returns.  Giving up investing in coal is certainly not a sacrifice.  In general, many of us seem to have an idea that Harvard and other major universities are in some sense progressive institutions, mainly because many of their students and at least some of their faculty have progressive beliefs about at least some subjects.  But examining the investment strategies and the employment records, including union relations, of Harvard and other major universities suggests otherwise.  So does the record of graduates of Harvard and other major universities who've gone on to distinctly non-progressive careers in finance and politics.  While it would be a very good thing if Harvard were to follow Ms. Lockwood's advice, I don't expect it to do so.  At least, not unless it saw making those changes as financially or politically unavoidable.",

In 2000, the dot-com bubble burst, destroying $6.2 trillion in household wealth. Seven years later, the housing market crashed, and from 2007 to 2009, the value of real estate owned by U.S. households fell by nearly the same amount \u2014 $6 trillion. In both cases the three big financial rating agencies \u2013 Moody\u2019s, Fitch and Standard & Poor all missed the signs of these overvalued assets.  \n\nFast forward to 2020 and history is about to repeat. According to James Leaton at Carbon Tracker, the market value of the top 100 public oil and gas companies and the top 100 public coal companies exceeds $7 tn, and state owned companies have a value of fossil fuel reserves at $27 tn.\n\nThe consensus among climate scientists and economists is that that 80% of coal, oil, and gas reserves must remain in the ground to maintain global temperatures below 2C, along with a more livable planet. With the majority of fossil fuel reserves being unburnable, the industry\u2019s market capitalization is severely overvalued.\n\nAccording to a Barclays Plc energy analysts, \u201cThe fossil fuel industry risks losing $33 trillion in revenue over the next 25 years\u201d. This will create seismic disruptions in markets for energy and transportation, followed by a massive stranding of their untapped resources requiring balance sheet write offs as losses.",

Fossil fuel consumption is determined by demand, not by supply, which is abundantly available. It's the consumption decision, not the production decision (the only decision which divestiture could possibly even remotely influence). Somebody will produce the fossil fuel to meet the demand. If it is not produced in the United States, it will be imported, at a loss of American jobs and an increase our balance of trade deficit.\n\nIf you want to impact global warming through the Harvard endowment, it is far better to ask for increased investment in companies researching and producing products that increase the supply and reduce the cost of renewable energy and energy conservation.\n\nDivesting from coal makes sense. Apart from metallurgical coal, we don't need to be producing or using coal. Natural gas is already cheaper and far cleaner for electricity production  Oil, and especially natural gas, are going to be consumed for quite some time and both are cleaner than coal. Modern nuclear plant designs are both inherently safe from meltdown and produce zero carbon emissions.\n\nSome  try to be more 'right on' but simply show ignorance of science, engineering, and economics who claim we can end fossil fuel use by 2030.

Since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1760, humans have been hellbent on spewing a mammoth portion of this stored carbon back into the atmosphere.  The planet is indicating it can't deal with this rapid rate of carbon reintroduction without severe consequences.\n\nHere's one way Harvard can think about this issue.  Imagine a standard bathtub that holds 80 gallons of water.  But this tub has a \"big faucet/small drain\" problem, so that when the faucet is turned on and allowed to flow forever one ounce of water will accumulate in the tub each day.  After 28 years the tub will begin to overflow. \n\nClimate scientists guesstimate that about 350 parts per million (ppm) of co2 is an acceptable atmospheric concentration level.  We \"turned on the faucet\" in 1988 when we blew through that measurement.  In 2016 the tub started overflowing as we could no longer deny that the heat trapping properties of greenhouse gases were causing extreme weather events.  This year co2 concentrations risk topping 418 ppm, an almost 20% increase over \"normal.\"  And this rate of co2 accumulation is accelerating.\n\nHarvard--and everyone else--has to decide how much household flood damage we can tolerate before we're forced to turn off the faucet.",

Those consequences disproportionately harm those people for whom climate change will be most devastating anyway.\n\nIt seems to me that a better strategy would be to, instead of engaging in outrage and demanding a negative action i.e. divestment, call for investment in renewable energy companies so that viable alternatives are options. I work in a downtown area with local HQs of major banks, and there are frequently divestment protests outside these buildings as well, so this is not a problem unique to liberal college campuses. To me, it seems like this is a movement that observed the success of prompting social change from nation states through divestment, but failed to procure the clarity, leadership, or expertise to realize divestment is not a one-size-fits-all strategy.",

My guess is not effective at all.\n\nBetter actions would be to help develop ALTERNATIVES to fossil fuels, and helping the world address population growth, which is the primary cause of global warming.\n\nOn the first issue, we need to explore the possibility of safe nuclear energy, including fission energy in the short run, and fusion energy in the longer run.  Building safe nuclear reactors would provide energy that works even when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow.  It represents a technological solution to energy problems.\n\nIt can be supplemented by developing biofuels that can replace fossil jet fuels with fuels made from algae in vats.  Research on genetic modification of plants might make possible such fuels in the intermediate term.  And yes we should encourage the fossil fuel companies to help develop those fuels.\n\nThe second point is we need a global one-child policy like that introduced by China in 1979.  If we are really serious about climate change we need to get to the root cause.\n\nMalthus was right when he argued that population growth caused poverty and eventually death by hunger or disease in 1798.  World population then was less than a billion.\n\nSo was Paul Ehrlich in 1968, when he published \"the Population Bomb.\"  World population then was 3.5 billion.\n\nPopulation growth is overwhelming our attempts to shift away from fossil fuels.\n\nWe need political action on that front.",

How do you suggest that I stay warm without the aide of my kerosene heater and wood burning fireplace?  Solar power isn't viable in snow country...and I don't live near a wind farm, or an hydroelectric plant.\n\nIf you want to boycott investments...why not companies that feed from the trough of The Military Industrial Complex?  Why not stop investing in private health insurance companies, until Medicare for All is the only viable insurance option?  Why not jettison the stocks in companies that thrive off of violent video games, mind numbing Twittering, online antisocial networking, unhealthy eating, booze, cannabis, etc....etc.?",

However, I think it is important to note that divestment, boycotts and similar techniques can be used not only against policies one abhors, but by others who support policies one dislikes.",
