            "comment_body": "The HUGE problem with these \"truther\" ads is they AREN'T THE TRUTH. \n\nI was maintained on opioid medication for EIGHT YEARS for serious chronic pain. Due to a malfunction with my HMO, I was unable to get a prescription refilled and had to be withdrawn from the medication. Because of the social stigma of taking opioids, I decided NOT to go back on them. NOT because I didn't NEED them, but because the SOCIAL STIGMA of taking them was simply TOO MUCH. I was tired of being treated like a junkie for taking medication as prescribed by my doctor. Instead, I CHOSE to live in serious chronic pain every day. It's been years since then and I've done everything I can, including developing auto-immune disease from overuse of anti-inflammatories and stomach meds to avoid opioids--which WORKED and didn't cause disease. \n\nI was NEVER addicted. I was, however, dependent, which is a physical condition. Addiction is psychological.\n\nThis is garbage. It does horrible things to people with chronic pain. It's bad science. It does nothing for addicts. It stigmatized dependence which IS NOT AND WILL NEVER BE addiction. \n\nThese non-truth ads are manipulative and they conflate dependence, which would indicate using a withdrawal cocktail to properly detox the body, with addiction which has a whole different treatment regimen. The reality is, we don't know WHY some people get addicted and why some people NEVER DO. \n\nThe solution is NOT to torture people by not giving them proper pain relief.",

The ads could help youth and worth a try. Any reinforcement and program would help. In my experience, my ex destroyed parts of my life back then as so many addicts do with their spouses and families. The financial, emotional and psychological damage he caused me was horrific. Any redeeming quality he once had was usurped by his disease. I ultimately left him when he secretly got another married addicted pregnant and I learned about it when she was 8 months along. Imagine financially paying for an addict to live under your roof and covering their bills only to have them betray you. The young child was ultimately given up to his family for rearing sadly. He was married. To me. Such a horrible betrayal after I helped him get better and would have done anything to assist in his recovery process. I attended mtgs, sat through his rehabs, detoxes, hospitalizations and cared for him financially as he concealed his use time and time again. He used on Amtrak home from Florida rehab! After 6 mos sobriety. I was used by him and his wealthy family never intervened to help me as I was left homeless bc of his negligence. It took a long while but I restarted my life, got several jobs, a new apt., studied and earned a Masters Degree. He was never injured or felt pain. Just loved his drugs and nothing was going to stop him from getting high. Nothing.",

Many of them were the same drugs that people are abusing today; some, like Darvocet, have been banned. The side effects are severe constipation (how do addicts stand it?) and dizziness. We couldn't wait to get off them, but saved a few for a bad day. I never met anyone who got addicted to them. The real drawback of this crisis is that people who really need these drugs can no longer get them. After I was run down by a van, I didn't get opioids, but high dose Rx Ibuprofin and scary muscle relaxants that numbed half my body. Thank goodness the Ibuprofin worked, but I had to take a lot of it.",

Problems happen when taking them for things like a lower back injury that will not heal, or not quickly. The first time I was scared to take them because of the fear of addiction. My surgeon then chewed me out for not taking them when the pain was so bad I couldn't do my rehab exercises. It is more important to do the exercises than to be stoic about the drugs. A fellow patient still refused to take them, and later he kept re-injuring himself because he had trained himself so well to ignore pain. After the heart surgery, it was necessary to take them because pain was preventing me from sleeping. At some point, not sleeping is worse for you than the drugs. The key is to stop after the immediate crisis passes, which I was able to do (but some have trouble with). I agree with anti-addiction efforts (as long as they don't scare people unrealistically). but these drugs do have a legitimate use. We need more research into pain.",

The problem is that no one knows the circumstances of the initial prescriptions, i.e., if they were required to control the pain or if they were requested by the patients or their families.  And whether or not they had already misused opioids appears to have been difficult to determine and certainly anyone trying to get opioids isn't going to tell doctors they had previously used them illicitly.\n\nThe second study regarding that increased probability of  long term use after only five days of therapy.  It is important to note that opioid dependence and opioid addiction are two different things.  The former is a physiological response to taking opioids that can occur in anyone.  The latter is a more complex issue combining physiological, psychological, environmental, and genetic factors.  \n\nAs to those ads.  I've seen many patients who've come up with all kinds of stories to obtain prescriptions for opioids.  I've never had one who self injured themselves in order to do so.

People presume you are abusing these drugs,at least the one that are not familiar with you. In NJ you need to show your license to buy sudefed and only once a month.

Right now there is a lot of justified emotion about drug overdoses, etc. but we must not lose sight of the more balanced view about the use of drugs to help alleviate pain.",

I reviewed the family planning literature and, more broadly, mass communications in public health. \n\nIt was a hot topic. Government organizations were spending millions of dollars to promote family planning. \n\nThey said, \"If we can use advertising to promote cigarettes, why can't we use it to promote public health?\" \n\nUnfortunately, the clear consensus was that these mass communications programs were ineffective. All that money was being wasted. The PR professionals were deluding themselves. \n\nThe best study was in auto safety. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety designed a textbook, randomized controlled trial to see whether professionally-produced TV commercials could encourage people to wear seat belts.

It's the feeling that addicts are after.\n\nWhen my elderly friend was going into cancer surgery, she was so frightened I worried for her sanity.

At age 80, she has never forgotten the feeling she got from the opiate and wishes she could feel that way again.  \n\nIt's the very nature of the opiate effect that makes it so sought after by humans for virtually thousands of years.  \n\nI believe opiates in the U.S. should be legal, prescibed and quality-controlled to get the criminal element and deadly Chinese Fentanyl out of these drugs. No addict or person in pain should have to seek their Rx on the street. \n\nRight now, the government is okay with people dying just on principle. \"Either quit willingly or we will take it away from you\" is the policy.

Campaigns to further label opioid dependence as merely junkies abusing substances alienates the majority of people who use opioids to their detriment, because they have no other options.

The NYT and others should explain what and who the Federalists were and compare and contrast their opinions against those of \"anti-federalists\" and other writers at the time. Instead, it seems  they pick a quote they like, attribute it to a founder to justify their premise, without putting the quote in context or explaining other opinions made at the time..Its lazy writing.

If the Republicans' desperate attempt to divert the attention from President Trump's actions in the Ukraine to Joe Biden's son Hunter is all for naught.  Because guess what?  After the Democratic primaries, Joe Biden just might not be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in 2020 running against Trump.\n\n2.  And what if the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate turns out to be Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren!\n\nHa!  All this bogus Republican smear campaign against Joe Biden just wasted hot air.  \n\nPlus, the very encouraging thought of a progressive president addressing climate change, rising economic inequality, health care for all, etc.--thereby leaving the Dark Ages Trump Republicans in the dust bin of  history, as the country moves forward not backward.\n\nYes, Republicans, make our day this way!",

I think the story goes like this...\n\nBack in the late sixties, the anti-war left started to view the flag-waving right not as well-meaning-but-misguided fellow citizens, but as irredeemably evil baby-killers.  Around the same time, the fight over abortion bred very similar resentments on the part of conservatives.  Naturally, liberal passions cooled with the end of the conflict in Vietman, but the right has had no such closure - hence, the asymmetric political warfare we see today.  The typical heartland evangelical voter is force-fed the view that they have to choose between a Republican, however flawed, and the devil himself.  With so little to show for his 3+ years in office, the ever-cunning, ever-cynical Trump will bang the pro-life drum non-stop until Election Day...and probably, I fear, win.",

But let me play along and try to put my mind to it. Certainly it was very enlightening to hear from legendary law scholars like Ken Starr, Alan Dershowitz, Jonathan Turley about constitutional and historic angles of imp. Imp also was better drama than Hollywood movies. Previously unknown to me US congresspersons like Elise Stephanik of NY, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Collins of Georgia, Gaetz of Florida got an opportunity to dazzles.\n\nThe impact of the imp on the Dem presidential nomination for 2020 will be profound by the time it is all said and done. Yesterday was a horrible day for Biden. Those who were sitting on the fence about Biden's conflicts of interest which was considered debunked by his establishment supporters was dug out very coherently and superbly by Attorney Pam Bondi of Florida. The biggest beneficiaries of demolishing Bidens were the front runners senators Bernie, Warren Klobuchar and mayor Butti. It is time Biden folds up instead of taking a page out of the Clinton book and deny deny deny that he did anything legally wrong or unethical. After yesterday's Bondi beating of Biden like a drug, there is no need to bring Bolten as the Democrats would want and Bidens as the Republicans would want as a witness and that will be historically the brightest side of the imp. As far as what other difference imp will unfold, wait and see",

There's a creepiness factor that goes beyond decibels. We're talking about the President who backed Roy Moore.\n\nMy biggest fear with Sanders isn't his often grating mannerisms. I'm worried he'll win handily on a split ticket but older Democrats will abandon him on the general ballot. The same people who insisted Clinton was a winner and demanded young voters support her. Imagine if Mitt Romney had taken another stab at the White House. I guarantee we wouldn't be talking about Clinton's popular vote tally.\n\nSo far at least, the shoe is on the other foot.

The Afghanistan Papers don\u2019t provide that kind of easy contrast; they demand a kind of holistic condemnation, in which Trump and those bureaucrats are part of the same problem.\nThe Afghanistan War has been a catastrophic failure for nearly two decades. This massive controversy receives disproportionately little coverage. Despite wasting thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars, everyone in the U.S. government gets off scot-free. The very people who have kept us in Afghanistan since 2001 remain empowered, thanks to a combination of cynicism and apathy. And as a result, the Afghanistan Papers have ended up working in favor of Trump\u2019s Republican Party, which exists to channel voters\u2019 contempt of elite lawmakers and the institutions they represent.",

First, the Russians are gonna back Trump which translates into backing the GOP. Secondly, I think they learned that much of the American public can't be bothered by people who would like to destroy one of the pillars of our democracy, i.e., the vote.\n\nHow else do you explain the GOP ranting about the Dems trying to overturn the 2016 vote and their complicity in allowing the vote rigger-in-chief himself to get away with using tax payer money to tarnish his primary opponent in the 2020 election? \n\nBarring a last minute crisis of conscience amongst the GOP senators, Trump will be howling his exoneration for the next 10 months. The only thing stopping him from bringing the concept of royalty back to the U.S. is the press and a willingness of deep state workers to feed the press a weekly dose of ever more lurid dirt on Trump.",

She's actually got approaches and plans, and she's willing to modify them as reality requires--FDR was BRILLIANT at that.\n3) Sanders DOES remind me of my uncle and my dad's friends (though he's closer to my eldest cousin than Dad's generation).  The \"Bad Date\" analogy is tough, considering Bernie and Jane have been married for over 30 years and never been a HINT of problems.  Yeah, he and Warren are VERY similar.\n4) Bret's ideas of \"great VP candidates\" is pretty lousy.  He ignored the BEST one: Stacey Abrams.

Also, we all know that the media has been obsessed with the importance of Iowa, a state whose electorate is very probably not representative of the rest of the country, but has the first caucus. Or NH, for that matter. A state that is also very probably not like the majority of the country. I would have appreciated repartee that focused on the relevance of Iowa and NH aside from their caucus and primary calendars. Also, one that focused on the electoral college and the composition of the electorate in the key states. \n\nFinally, please remember that there is nothing humorous about Trump and his damage to our country already.",

That didn't work out for them.  For almost two years they proclaimed how Mueller was going to get Trump  convicted and have him dragged out of the White House in chains. Other than that that, they didn't pass a single significant piece of legislation,though they get a few post offices named for someone. This past year the only thing they voted for that was significant was Trump's trade deal. Trumps economy, seven million new jobs,   reduction in unemployment rate and new trade agreements is unique. We are not at war and he did take out someone who two presidents traded the lives and limbs of our military so that Soleimani could live. Who can beat him, Sanders? He is a profession politician who has live out of the wallets of tax payers most of his adult life and now wants to turn this country into a socialistic nation. How about Biden? Biden will defeat himself. This impeachment will soon be gone and will have only solidified the opinions held before the hearings. Trump will have two themes to run on, \"Promises Kept\" and \"I gave the power to you and they are trying  to take it back. Don't let them.\" He is going to be hard to beat, especially when socialism, government with total control of health care, higher education and tax increases up to 50%or more is all you have to offer.",

He is the only genuine article beholding only to working and down on their luck citizens out there.  All his accomplishments were as an independent under a progressive banner.  What holds some Americans back is fear of reforms because the government has disappointed them too often.  Someone so dedicated to make government work is surging politically because in spite of increasing GDP, the economy is not properly ensuring a living wage for those that work and decent help for those down on their luck who have been isolated from dignified existence.",

Now the Court claims the Constitution somehow privileges the particular beliefs of right wing Christianity. (In a prior case, where Scalia found no protection for religious liberty, the issue involved was Native American religion.) The newly defined \"right\" of religious liberty was activated only as a weapon to deny rights to others. Similarly, the Heller case discovered a new right to gun ownership that 200 plus years of Supreme Court cases never found. In this instance. the right wing bloc on the Court literally weaponized a political viewpoint with Constitutional protection that has no basis in the original meaning of the text in the Constitution. The rhetoric of gun rights often threatens the very notion of democracy with the attitude if elections don't go the \"right\" way there is a \"Second Amendment solution.\"  There is polarization because others have demanded that they have the same rights as white men, and the militant resistance of some white men to recognizing the rights of others. I guess conservative \"originalism\" means that originally only white man had rights, therefore any recognition of the rights of others is unconstitutional.",

The filibuster essential dis-empowered the senate AND the whole legislative branch and the judiciary was put in an uncomfortable position of appearing to legislate morality, which delegitimized both institutions. From what we are seeing now I the judiciary is now the verge of being delegitimized as well. Ironically, John Roberts seems to understand this but given the recent ideological Supreme Court appointments, he may not be able to do anything about it. That would leave an all powerful executive.

While I understand the partisan polarization of the current moment, if we take a broader sociological stock of the country, you can argue that we've witnessed a major integration of American society in the past 25 years. If we simply take two empirical measures of social integration--residence and marriage--we find that more and more different types of Americans are living together and creating families together. In aggregate, since 1980, residential segregation declined by 12 percent in the U.S. At the same time, interracial households grew by 3.5 percent since 2000. Many conservative, southern states are experiencing the fastest-growing rates of interracial marriages, with Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and Georgia clocking in rates that are higher than the national average. Given the social integration of Americans, the intriguing question is, \"Why is our political life more polarized?\" As a sociologist, my sense is that a relatively small number of hyper-motivated and ill-intentioned Americans have captured our political life. For various ideological and even self-serving reasons, they have built an economy and an ecology of political polarization where careers and fortunes can be made on dividing Americans apart politically. If we have wiser political leadership, they would do something about it.",

That weaponization of language, and refusal to consider the possibility that the other side had any legitimacy at all, has continued to this day among Republicans. It is rooted in insecurity, for acknowledging that the other side has validity is the start of a very slippery slope back to the pre-Gingrich era of Republican minority status.",

Bin Laden, despite being dead, won that round.  It forced America to take sides, and fear Islam.

In fact, their pushing, with Clinton's bone headed help, China into the WTO exacerbated everything.  In 1980 in China your average annual income was $100; today it's $11K.

But outrage and fear keep people glued to their screens and are thus profitable.  \n\nAnd the conservative billionaire class that doesn't want any taxes or regulation has found that using these cultural issues to stir up the less-well educated, less cosmopolitan segments of our society is a useful way of gaining political power that can then deliver the goods to them.\n\nThe polarization isn't all accidental.",

The rise of insider religious sects is the key to understanding the way politics works. There are both liberal and conservative insider religious sects. Some have origin stories that promote racial identity. Some are ideological politically, and some are ideological through the implications of their tenets. Some are very tribal in their emphasis, connecting to ancient religious legends. And because they're full of insiders, they're flush with money. While there hasn't been much of a public analysis of such sects, groundbreaking New Yorker investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has spoken on them. Pope Francis has moved to limit some. There are murmurs about them in popular culture. Without taking these associations into account and how they influence religious polarization often unbeknownst to everyday believers and also influence political events, the picture is incomplete.",

'Evangelical Christian', for instance, is an increasingly inaccurate label for large number of people who use that term to describe themselves, as they are largely united by a conservative cultural politics oriented around defending clear hierarchies of sex, race, and class that has very little to do with Christian theology at all--e.g. large numbers of 'evangelicals' don't go to church, and they are *more* conservative on race, sex, immigration, and class divisions than evangelicals who do go to church (though the ones that do go to church are pretty conservative, they are more likely to do philanthropic things).

We have also seen the migration of the best jobs to our two coasts--some notable islands in between--and our politics dividing on the same lines. The strongest predictor I could ever find for how states went in presidential elections was the percentage of college graduates in the population. As a retired psychologist, I view the situation fatalistically. We're not going to change the evolution of jobs, and we're not likely to get any smarter.",

Urban is mixed racially, tolerant of diversity, generally dynamic, economically ascending, supportive of change, pro-immigration, pro-world view.

The effort to save Europe from communism allowed the rise of the hybrid state and it threatened what remained of the old, discredited \"capitalism is king\" policies that Republicans clung to. A new breed of Republican took over the party after Nixon. Edwin Meese brought us Reagan and a whole new idea, find a pretty face to put on a vicious scorched earth political strategy that would never compromise with New Deal policies and carry the \"greed is good\" banner forward. After Meese came Karl Rove, the master mind of wedge issue politics behind George Bush's pretty face. The revolution was almost complete. The old guard Republicans were being replaced by people who wanted the citizenry to be at each other's throats. The New Republican party embraced the old Dixiecrat racists, rejected the Roe v Wade compromise in favor of fanning the flames of hard-line religious zealotry. New wedge issues, \"gun rights\" and \"the war on Christmas\" were created to keep the hate circulating. \nAnd now we have Trump who proclaims the hate proudly.",

It was his embrace of free trade with low wage countries that drove workers into the arms of Republicans.  \nIndeed, their response to being let down by the government in favor of the educated classes has been libertarianism (we don't need anyone) and iconoclasm (... all of you). That of course, was/is a mentality highly compatible with the one furthered by the corporations behind the GOP. Conversely, many of the upper middle class could find themselves in the Democrats' embrace of economic growth, cheap products over manufacturing and low taxes over social programs. \n\nThat's why I mark Clinton '92 as the turning point, and why I think getting the workers back from Republicans is the key to reversing polarization. \nWe need to rethink free trade with low wage countries.

But none of them mention the unique confluence of events that came after WW2: the fact that America was the only leading manufacturing nation that hadn't been severely damaged, and the military hegemony that allowed it to keep its monopoly for decades. This happened before civil rights, so the value of the white American male's labor soared.\n\nThe rest of the world caught up in manufacturing, civil rights divided the pie, and that decreased the value of American male labor. And people with diminished expectations tend to act irrationally. Meanwhile, the right wing think tanks have been fine tuning their rhetoric to demonize anything that involves working together as if we were all part of the same team.\n\nI'm not saying the explanations in the three books are incorrect, just that it's a complicated reality with many moving parts.",

States that are primarily rural have elected anti tax Republicans who wind up providing inferior services and environments for business. So the cities thrive and rural areas go into decline.

The most laughable is that education causes people to have a \"bunker\" mentality. Why not just examine the reason why certain individuals benefit from dividing the masses. No, the social safety net & fear of poor minorities getting too much of the pie is not a cogent explanation as Trump just gave Midwestern farmers over 16 billion dollars while cutting SNAP, attempted to kill the ACA & rollback Medicaid, rolled back protections for blacks against discrimination, passed a tax bill that excludes blacks from sharing in the wealth, rolled back legal aid & protections for poor minorities from being \"over policed\" in their neighborhoods & many other cruel policy objectives. The media profits from division and class/racial hostilities as well as the ruling 1% of society. After all, \u201cDivide et impera\u201d is as old as politics and war. Diving your enemy so you can reign approach expressed by Julius Caesar is as old as Western Civilization. Caesar applied it to conquer Gaul twenty two centuries ago.  But he wasn't the first one, nor the last one, to implement it.  Trump is just the latest wannabe Caesar to employ this simple but effective political strategy. Douthat attempts to over intellectualize the ruling class's greed & lust for power which has caused immense income inequality.",

Many feel that Trump is carrying out their wishes--tax cut for big business, deregulation, setting up a totally conservative judiciary, and \"keep minorities in their place\"---and even knowing that he is a serial liar and incompetent administrator does not lessen their support.  Others who support him just  believe him.  Even if they are educated they have not learned critical thinking in their education, which relies on a thorough evaluation of sources.

Although I haven't read any of them yet, Douthat's summary of each leads me to propose that they have one very fundamental thing in common: How people have come to view society in general and politics in particular.\n\nPrince Otto von Bismarck, an 1800s German aristocrat and statesman, is credited with saying that politics is the art of the possible. That view has clearly fallen by the wayside. In its place, the view of Carl Schmitt, a German political theorist of the early to mid-1900s, has become dominant. In his 1932 book, \"The Concept of the Political,\" Schmitt argued that politics is best defined as opposition to those who have different values, beliefs, or political philosophies, and that one should view these groups, whether they are external or internal, as the enemy. After all, they represent ideas one group doesn't believe in because they are seen as destructive to society. Compromise, in this view, makes no logical sense. There are several factors that result in people adopting a friend/enemy worldview and I suspect the authors of these three books mention them. What I will be looking for when I read them, however, is whether they offer any kind of workable solution to our current morass because I do not see one arising any time soon.",

The human mind that used to be engaged most of the time for survival challenges are now free from those needs. What human minds do to fill up the gap - the education system did not prepare the mind to engage positively on emotional, social and spiritual aspects of life. The traditional rational thoughts go to some length and then gets lost on infinite loop of causality. Human minds has become the destructive liability of human existence - hate, drug addiction, violence, gun culture, social media addiction, broken family these are the modern evils of twenty first century not poverty.

In addition to asking why we are polarized, it might also be worth asking how much.\n\nThe Perception Gap Project (see their website) polled people not only on their own beliefs and positions, but also what they thought \"the other side\" believes.  It turns out that most of us have highly distorted perceptions of our opponents, most of whom hold moderate positions--not the exaggerated straw man profiles we often rant about.\n\nSo why do we do this?  Extreme beliefs are held by the political fringes, and it is too easy (and too tempting) to use them as representative of larger groups.  Political tribes and political media add to the distortion.  Perception gaps, on both sides, increase with media consumption, especially partisan sources.  BTW, Fox News does indeed increase the gap for conservatives (8%) but the NY Times does the same for liberals (10%).  Those who consume media from the other side have smaller perception gaps.  Finally, education does not help. Especially for Democrats, gaps increase with degrees from no high school (8%) to post-grad (30%).  This probably has much to do with self-selected political bubbles.\n\nThe good news: we are not as polarized as some suggest (and want us to think).  And we can become less polarized if we want to.\n\nDo you?",

Unless you have a printing press in your basement, Ross, you cannot do this. \n\nFederal deficits & debts are nothing to worry about & in fact, are necessary. ALL 6 times we have eliminated deficits & paid down the debt 10% or more, we have fallen into a terrible real depression.\n\nSince prices are proportional to the amount of money in the economy (times its velocity), creating too much money could cause excessive inflation. BUT prices are also inversely proportional to the amount of goods and service we can produce. A bumper wheat crop LOWERS wheat prices. And that is what FDR's policies did. They increased production while getting more money to the people who needed it and would spend it.\n\nOf course, if the economy is constrained and you can't produce any more, this will not work. For example, if you just lost a war, and you did not have enough arable land to grow food to feed your people, and had no money to buy food, and your people were starving, printing money is just going to result in billion mark stamps.\n\nBut that is certainly NOTHING like our situation today when production could be vastly increased if people only had more money to buy stuff, &  money comes from federal deficits.",

That being said, in terms of solutions to our country's maddening polarization, I'm not one to overindulge in endless, Freudian-like searches for the source of the problem.  Like Freudian psychotherapy, a deep dive to learn the source of the problem can be intriguing, but it rarely results in a fundamental benefit - the anxious, neurotic patient is still anxious and neurotic though better informed.\n\nInstead, I believe we need to look to more pragmatic solutions.  Whatever the cause (and your ultimate point is that it is complicated), the solution lies in creating the right positive incentives for people to behave in a less polarizing manner, politicians and the media in particular.  \n\nMy praise of your conservative voice is an example.  I'm left of center, but love reading your perspective.  Chris Wallace's continuing rise at Fox News is another example.  He's (slowly) teaching those basking in the uninformed righteousness of their ignorance to more graciously consider all opinions.  I'm hoping to see more politicians rewarded for good behavior and more incentives created for those who engage in civility and open-minded debate.  \n\nOn that note, let's continue to encourage the NYTimes to maintain and strengthen its conservative voice.  It must own its left-leaning limitations in order to force readers to consider their bias when they engage with others.",

The balkanization of the news media:  A news media is dominated by advertisers, who have a monetary incentive to divide us to better target audiences.  This is why radio stations never offer a true variety of music.  This is why Fox offers a different news spin than MSNBC.  For instance there is even a news outlet now that favors Bernie Sanders (Hill Rising) funded by corporate sponsors.  And the entire purpose of social media is to market our personalities to sell products to our \"friends.\"\n\n2. The balkanization of education:  Increasing \"choice\" in education from elementary school through the university has further divided us by providing us with competitive bogus theories.  Economics 101 is an apology for greed.   Sociology 101 promotes a victimization culture.  We are now segregated according to income rather than race. \n\n3. The time-tested historic strategy to divide the working class to keep the elite in power:   In all societies there is a strong survivalist motivation for the elite to divide us along race, religion, and gender to prevent us from uniting to carry out reforms that are in the interest of the working class.   This is why corporations fund identity politics and promote this divisive perspective in the corporate media.  The more we focus on identity politics the less we unite on bread and butter issues that made our country the envy of the world in the mid-20th Century.",

From 1920-1965, the middle class prospered, an era of relative bipartisanship reigned again, wealth gaps closed, and measures of well being and physical health improved. \n\nThe theory behind this is structural demographic. When you have a large input of cheap labor, it obviously immiserates the middle and lower classes, but less obviously it makes it easier for the rich to get richer. These elites then start to fight amongst one another for a finite number of available political positions, limited seats at elite schools, and limited status positions in media and entertainment and so on. \n\nFrom 1830-1910 the cheap labor input was mass immigration from Ireland, Germany, Italy, Greece, and Poland. From 1965 the cheap labor input has been mass immigration from the global South. \n\nTurn off the spigot, and wages climb. Turn off the spigot, and polarization subsides. Turn off the spigot, and the wealth gap will close. \n\nStand-by open borders, and lose. \n\nMost of Turchin\u2019s message is expressed mathematically and in safe academise, but it\u2019s also accessible.

I as much as anyone would like for us all to sit together and sing campfire songs, but I think that unrealistic. So don't panic over differences. Sally forth and argue for your vision of the good society, and everyone else can do the same. As long as we agree that the means to the end is politics, the system is working.",

One is based on the fundamentalist religions - the Calvinists, the stubborn Scotch Irish of the Appalachians, the Germanic people who brought forth black and white morality, strong belief in self-reliance, Libertarianism and a disdain for government.

It is finally realized that the oppression of women is cultural and systemic within all regions, ethnic groups and social classes. The improvement in women's education in all countries of the region and the opening of learning horizons made possible by the internet, have had an immediate response among women. The liberation of women, no doubt, will be a powerful force to lift countries of the region to higher levels of development. Under the administration of Rafael Correa, Ecuador instituted laws of gender equality in the national congress and cabinet posts. But, as often is the case, a progressive government is followed by a conservative one and the gains are reversed. I think that this feminist movement will be sustained because women live daily the realities of disadvantage and vulnerability that motivate women to be involved and the educational level of women in Chile and Argentina is higher than elsewhere in the region.",

It is systemic. \n\nIt is also found in the ways that mothers raise their sons to be machista and their daughters to \"overlook\" that. There are plenty of women who are machistas, let's not forget, and I wonder if any research has been done anywhere to find out why (my idea is that they raise their sons to be part of the patriarchal social order so they can not only survive in it but also, eventually, protect their mother!).  \n\nI've been wondering about systems ever since - back in the 1960s - I saw brothers and fathers and male cousins getting benefits that we could not even think about. And here we are, still going strong like you pointed out in political representation. Thank you again for this article and for the NY Times for continuing to publish articles like this. \n\nNow, go check out the YOUTube presentations from all over the world! Inspiring!",

Even within ethnic groups, each is just advocating for their own race, their own neighborhood, not seeing that this is all connected, and that a white woman living in rural North Dakota is probably experiencing similar levels of oppression to a black man living in New York. \n\nSometimes America's individualism gets the best of us.",

It is a small additional step to get them to believe the earth is flat, or that Trump was put into office as part of God's plan to bring about the rapture.\n\nSuch ill-informed people elect legislators who repay their ignorance with treachery.

What the antifederalists, or the founding fathers for that matter, couldn't imagine was that the minority population of the country would actually control the government.  The expectations are that by 2040, two-thirds of Americans will be represented by just 30% of the Senate.  But we don't have to wait until 2040 to see the impact of minority rules.  Look back to 2000's presidential election, to 2016's presidential, or to the overall vote count for senators across the country.  Today, in America, THE MINORITY RULES.  And they know it and will do whatever they can to ensure it stays like that.....and why wouldn't they.  We wouldn't be talking about antifederalists or impeachment witnesses if the Senate were controlled by the total number of people who actually voted.

When the party is led by a demagogue, or a self-centered, unprincipled person, Congress is all too eager to 'go along and get along' rather than stand up to a megalomaniac in the White House.\n\nWhen presidents at least tried to create the appearance of governing 'for all the people', and pretended to be concerned more about the security of the nation than the security of their position, the system worked. As an increasingly powerful executive branch took advantage of Congress's desire to never take any action that might upset -anyone-, presidents grew more powerful.\n\nFor Congress it was far better to let the executive branch make all the tough decisions. Now Congress's abdication of their own interests is coming around to bite them... Trump willfully, blatantly, and openly abuses his office for his own personal gain and aggrandizement -- and his party in Congress is so scared and cowed that they fail miserably to be a check on Trump.\n\nStanding up to Trump will require courage and convictions that members of Congress has been lacking for decades. I don't think any Republican Senators will 'find their mojo' now, after being weak vassals for years.",

Rape and murder had to made constitutional in order for these plantation owners slave traders to join into the war for independence and the new nation.\nToday, there is a legal theory called Originalism that argues that  the country was founded by people whose ideas are so good that we shouldn't deviate from what we imagine they thought at the time. Justice Scalia famously (and quite psychotically) thought he was the one who knew best what these rapists and their apologists really thought. \nThe eighteenth century Federalists wanted to protect the minority of the opulent from the tyranny (righteous payback?) of the majority by reducing democracy (the power of voters) and increasing  constitutional protections for the wealthy (the power of property).   In just forty years, the neo-Federalist originalists have erased two hundred years of scientific, social, and moral progress and moved the society back into the late eighteenth century. It's an impressive achievement. \nThe other option, opposed to reducing democracy, is to reduce inequality. This is the progressive politics best expressed in the current primaries by Sanders and Warren.

I can almost hear Putin whispering to Trump in an empty room- one of those meetings we know nothing about- these same words. If he had how do you think Trump would have responded? My point here is that if by chance Putin said something like this, very few of us have the confidence to believe that Trump put Putin in his place. \n\nYet, though I don't believe revolution is a good thing- much as I believe divorce is never a good thing-  sometimes it is necessary.  The 'trick' is to know if the marriage can be saved or must become something unrecognizable to survive. \n\nI'm not prepared to live in an unrecognizable country. Therefore I'm glad the impeachment trial is taking place even if it strengthens a corrupt party that without a passion for democracy and what's right, acquits a president who may have already sold our country down the river. I am not an advocate of violence even though I've been told (accurately) that I have a bad temper. Our country may indeed be headed for a revolution of civil disobedience.

Television broadcast shows for both political parties present only a sliver of news with many hours devoted to speculation that has no factual basis.\n\nCan the Senate be eliminated?  Not sure if that is really what is wanted.  What is needed is a uniform method for voters to hear both sides of an argument - for all political races.  That was part of the reason for local public television, but CABLE networks do not support it.  Since they can lobby successfully politicians elected through ignorance, there isn't much chance of it happening.",

He warned the country about the risks and dangers of divisive political parties and their quest for power in his Farewell Address in 1796:\n\n\"the spirit of the party serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection.\"\n\nReading Bouie's excellent column reminded me of an experience I had as a college freshman. In 1960, we had a discussion in my Pol. Sci 101 class about Washington's Farewell address, how difficult it is to get much done in government, and problems of corruption, fraud, and waste in government.  \n\nThe professor then had us debate the idea whether we should do away with divisive political parties and move to a government run by professionals, rather than leaving government administration to inexperienced party hacks and big party donors.  \n\nThis memory was rekindled when I heard the professional diplomats testify in the House impeachment hearings.\n\nThe contrast between these experienced, knowledgeable, rational, caring diplomats and Mr. Trump and his political GOP hacks is a clear case for the need for professionalism at top levels of our government.",

And it must be borne in mind that, when anti-\nfederalists complained how independent of the people the proposed Senate was, they were speaking at a time when Senators were elected by state legislatures.  For more than a hundred years now, Senators have been elected by the people of their state.\n\nNor does Mr. Bouie's thesis explain the similar level of cravenness in the House.  Not a single House Republican voted for impeachment.  I think that proves that the rot stems primarily from the GOP, not the structure of the Senate.  Yes, McConnell is a true villain who has systematically chipped away at the foundations of our constitutional republic.  But the party picks its own leaders.

Even when the Senate is properly doing its job (I am old enough to recall a few instances), it does so with the good of the republic and its citizens as minor considerations. Most of the actions of the Senate can be shown to be anti-republic and anti-citizen.\n\nTop considerations seem to be career, party and corporate campaign contributors. While this hasn't changed since I have been paying attention (1970 to the present), what has changed is that senators no longer bother to cover their tracks or explain their actions when confronted with their own malfeasance. Instead they attack the other party and assail the media, who are the usual confronters.\n\nThrow the bums out before they do irreparable harm to our brief, fragile experiment. Or, if you prefer, throw the bums out because it is the moral choice. Or because it is rational. Or perhaps to further your own favorite positive change, 'cause it ain't happening with the Senate in place.",

I was not aware of the concerns of the National Federalists against impeachment back in the day, so thank you for the history lesson. \n\nIt is ironic because just yesterday I told my wife that after this impeachment will no longer be considered a viable constitutional tool to hold a President accountable. It is a poorly conceived process and too ill defined to be practicable. \n\nThe playbook is simple: give congress nothing and delay in the courts for possibly years until the next election. I think every future President will simply carry out this strategy if they commit serious abuses.\n\nUnless the President and both houses of congress are of the opposite party, holding the President accountable is now officially a shame. Accountability just does not exist and so the branches of government are not in fact co equal.\n\nI think it also time to stop viewing the founders as gods and the constitution as if it was akin to the 10 commandments handed down directly from God to Moses. \n\nProvisions like the electoral college are antiquated and also ill conceived and need to be changed and it is time for us to start thinking about these issues seriously.",

They are allowing this because addressing the case honestly means considering the facts which show that Trump conducts himself without any respect for laws nor other people, and will do whatever he may with impunity.\n\nTrump\u2019s managers are offering sophistry by legal experts, tangential issues about whether the Senate must limit decisions according to the certainty of legal truths (relying upon established law under circumstances where the law is not certain and not established ) and thinly asserting motives which may be plausible but are inconsistent with facts presented so far. The principles of the law as they apply to impeachment must fit the facts to achieve a just legal result. To do that one must know the facts and start there. The President\u2019s defense essentially asserts that the Congress has no standing to bring their case nor to judge it.

But it was only recently that unprincipled people (Trump, McConnell, Barr, Graham (et. al.), began driving trucks through the gaps. What we find is that the institutions are a lot more fragile than we thought. America's founders wanted future generations to perfect the government, not just sit on the Constitution as written (or with painfully few amendments). Time for a series of new ones.\n\nFor example, Amendment 28 could require that a prospective Supreme Court justice who is duly nominated by the president must get a vote up or down in the Senate within 90 days, and if no vote happens, the nominee is deemed appointed. This would seal one hole and stop the mischief of future McConnells on appointments.\n\nWith that in mind, let you imagination run wild. The electoral college is out of date because of modern communication; the budget must be balanced (and if there's an emergency, get a three-fourths override in Congress); constitutional amendments should have an expiration date; the powers of the president, including executive privilege, should be defined more carefully based on what we know now; the Supreme Court should have original jurisdiction on emoluments clause disputes.\n\nMany potential amendments would make the country run better.",

Not too long ago, right-wing Conservatives, thinking they could ENSURE having 67 Senators, looked to repeal the 17th because they controlled enough states to hit that 67 level.\n\nHowever, much of the problem remains: in 2018, with only 1/3 of the Senators up, still 13 million more voted for Dems than for Republicans, yet the GOP picked up 2 seats.    26 states, controlling an absolute majority of Senate seats, represent less than 18% of the people, while the 10 largest states, with 58% of the people, only have 1/5th of the seats.\n\nBut, Bolton's Bombshell has a 2-pronged fork.  The first is obvious--Bolton TOTALLY makes a lie of EVERY defense of Trump--the whole Ukraine thing is and was ALWAYS to hurt Joe Biden, for Trump's personal benefit.  This is really bad for Trump.\n\nBut even worse is that the White House had an advance copy of Bolton's book for several weeks, before the trial began, knew the bombshells he was dropping...AND DID NOT TELL MITCH MCCONNELL!  With the WH's usual short-sightedness, they threw their absolutely most critical ally under the bus!

They are wrong.   \n The Framers  expressly prohibited receipt of aid from foreigners in elections, and  especially so in the case of the president. They knew the danger that a president might become a dictator with the corrupting support of foreign dictators and kings. They may not have  foreseen the complicity of the current GOP Senate majority, nor the rise of powerful propaganda media in service to one man, but their intent was plainly that Americans elect their government without foreign meddling.\n Trump was recorded ordering the  \"take out\" of Ambassador Yovanovitch after receiving advice from  Lev Parnas, associate of the indicted Russian Dimitro Firtash.  \nIf the GOP Senators do not investigate this, and believe more evidence will not surface, they are both incompetent and traitorous.",

This assumption seemed to be vindicated in the case of Nixon, who resigned when he saw that he was likely to be impeached and convicted.  Perhaps he also was public-spirited enough himself not to try to take the matter to an ultimate partisan level. The choice of Senators is ultimately up to the people, and the partisanship of voters favoring Republicans has been deliberately increased by the cynical decision of Republican leaders to exploit racism and xenophobia.\n\nBut the more serious problem, which may be more easily remedied, is the role of the electoral college in the choice of the President.  Clearly if the President himself had been chosen by the will of the majority several problems since 2000 would have been avoided.  The best way to change this may be through activity in the states via the National Popular Vote movement.  A shift of population to the more populous states could assist this movement.",

Committed simply to winning elections, party leaders sought the candidate with the broadest political appeal, which generally ruled out someone with Trump's abrasive personality and lack of scruples.\n\nTrump's victory signaled the decay of the GOP, as evidenced by the fact that he defeated the party's nominal leaders, who immediately transformed themselves from critics into sycophants.

Bolton surmises that he did this for his own personal financial benefit, especially in Turkey. But what has the Senate done to call this out and control it? Nothing. It is this submission to the President and abdication of their oversight responsibilities which shows how the Senate enters into \"seditious treaties\" we now see with China and Turkey.\n\nBut, while Trump's willingness to favor these autocratic regimes  is worthy of impeachment in its own right, what about Russia? If financial gain is what is really driving Trump, then that screams for scrutiny about the way Putin launders mob and oligarch money through Deutsche Bank directly to Trump. All the talk about extorting Ukraine is trivial compared to that.\n\nIt's hard to comprehend that an American President would sell the country out for a few dollars like this. But, there it is.

In the aftermath of the Trump disaster, hopefully our nation will eventually take steps to restore a functioning democracy, which will need to include elimination of the Electoral College, term limits (at least in the Senate), and perhaps expansion of the Supreme Court.   \n\nWatching democracies across our planet, it appears that the US model may not be the best method of achieving democracy.  The parliamentary system may offer greater flexibility to respond to complex times, and oust corrupt leaders.\n\nIn the end, will the US system allow for self-correction, or will we just separate into two countries - this time without war and to the relief of virtually everyone?",

The Founders mandated that Senators be appointed by each state's legislators, not put in to their positions via a public vote.

They have become the arrogant, exclusive aristocrats the Founders feared.  All because of the direct public vote.\nIf Senators were elected by their state legislatures, as originally directed in the Constitution, they would be more in touch with the needs of their states, since they would be held to thoswe who were elected to govern the states they hail from. They would face competition to retain their positions, every election. The direct vote is why Senators are more coronated than elected; the parties they belong to maintain a system bereft of competition for their incumbents, giving themselves entitlements such as Chairman of this Committee, Ranking member of that Committee. The public does not follow what these things mean. They don't monitor how many Senators actually participate in these Committees; but state legislators might, since each might be seeking such an appointed position in the future. Term limits are not a necessary consideration when competition and accountability are part of a process; clearly the Senate has neither.",

Another point is that the Senate's reason for existence in the first place, that the U.S.A. is a confederation of \"sovereign states\" (like the countries that are part of the European Union) that should therefore get equal representation in the Senate regardless of population, is absurd. The current Senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, used to be Governor of Massachusetts. Hillary Clinton used to be Arkansas's First Lady, then she became a Senator from New York. You don't see a politician from Denmark later running for office in Italy, because the countries that make up the E.U. are separate, sovereign countries, unlike our 50 states. The current impeachment trial shows one unfortunate result of the Senate's giving each state in this country the same number of Senators, and the electoral college giving massively more weight to the smaller states. We now have an impeachment trial of a President who lost the popular vote, presided over by a Chief Justice appointed by another President who lost the popular vote, run by the Majority Leader in or Senate, whose party controls the Senate despite a majority of Americans voting for Democratic Senators.",
