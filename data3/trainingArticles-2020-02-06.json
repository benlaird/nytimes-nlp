            "full_text": " How Trump Wins Again Are Democrats going to give this\n election away? By David Brooks Opinion Columnist As several people have \nnoticed, this was the most politically successful week of the Trump presidency. \nFirst, President Trump\u2019s job approval numbers are rising. When the impeachment \ninquiry got rolling in October his Gallup approval rating was 39. Now it\u2019s 49. \nIf he can hold this level, he\u2019ll probably be re-elected. Second, impeachment \nnever became a topic of conversation among rank-and-file Democrats, let alone \nindependents and Republicans, so it was easily defeated in the Senate. To the \nextent that it was noticed, impeachment worked for Republicans and against \nDemocrats. Approval of the Republican Party is now at 51 percent, its highest \nsince 2005. More Americans now identify as Republicans than as Democrats. As \nGallup dryly observed in announcing these numbers, \u201cGallup observed similar \npublic opinion shifts when Bill Clinton was impeached.\u201d Third, there is no \nDemocratic transcender. The Iowa results, though far from final, indicate that \nthere is no obvious candidate who can be quickly embraced by all factions of the\n party. With Mike Bloomberg now doubling his campaign spending, it looks like \nthe Democratic primary battle is going to go on for a while. Democrats may wind \nup in a position in which they can\u2019t nominate Bernie Sanders because he\u2019s too \nfar left, and they can\u2019t not nominate him because his followers would bolt from \na Biden/Bloomberg/Buttigieg-led party. Only 53 percent of Sanders voters say \nthey will certainly support whoever is the Democratic nominee. This is no idle \nthreat. In 2016, in Pennsylvania, 117,000 Sanders primary voters went for Trump \nin the general, and Trump won the state by 44,292 ballots. In Michigan, 48,000 \nSanders voters went for Trump, and Trump won the state by 10,704. In Wisconsin, \n51,300 Sanders voters went for Trump, and Trump won the state by 22,748. In \nshort, Sanders voters helped elect Trump. Fourth, Trump has cleverly reframed \nthe election. I can see why Nancy Pelosi ripped up his State of the Union \nspeech. It was the most effective speech of the Trump presidency. In 2016, Trump\n ran a dark, fear-driven \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d campaign. His 2016 convention speech\n was all about crime, violence and menace. The theme of this week\u2019s speech was \nmostly upbeat \u201cMorning in America.\u201d I don\u2019t know if he can keep this tone, \nbecause unlike Ronald Reagan, he\u2019s not an optimistic, generous person. But if he\n can, and he can keep his ideology anodyne, this message can resonate even with \npeople who don\u2019t like him. Trump\u2019s speech reframes the election around this core\n question: Is capitalism basically working or is it basically broken? Trump can \nrun on the proposition that it\u2019s basically working. He has a lot of evidence on \nhis side: The unemployment rate is the lowest in decades. Wages are rising. The \ntypical family income is higher than it has ever been. Americans seem to accept \nthis position. Confidence in the economy is higher now than at any moment since \nthe Clinton administration. According to Gallup, 59 percent of Americans say \nthey are better off than they were a year ago. Three-quarters of Americans \nexpect to be even better off a year from now. Democrats, by contrast, have \ncongregated around the message that capitalism is fundamentally broken and that \nthe economy is bad. As Matthew Yglesias noted recently in Vox, when Democrats \nwere asked in the PBS NewsHour/Politico debate if the economy was good, they all\n gave the same answer. Joe Biden: \u201cI don\u2019t think [Americans] really do like the \neconomy. Look at the middle-class neighborhoods. The middle class is getting \nkilled. The middle class is getting crushed.\u201d Pete Buttigieg: \u201cThis economy is \nnot working for most of us.\u201d Elizabeth Warren: \u201cA rising G.D.P., rise in \ncorporate profits, is not being felt by millions of families across the \ncountry.\u201d And so on down the line. An opposition party can retake the White \nHouse in a time of rising economic conditions, but it can\u2019t do it by denouncing \ncapitalism and it can\u2019t do it by denying the felt reality of a majority of \nAmericans. It\u2019s hard to defeat a president in good times. U.C.L.A. political \nscientist Lynn Vavreck, the author of \u201cThe Message Matters\u201d and a co-author of \n\u201cIdentity Crisis,\u201d has found that the rare candidates who do succeed find issues\n that voters care about just as much. In 1960, John Kennedy ran on the missile \ngap. In 1968, Richard Nixon ran on law and order. In 2016, Trump ran on Middle \nAmerica identity politics. What would that issue be? Well, in his book \u201cThe \nMoral Consequences of Economic Growth,\u201d Benjamin Friedman argues that in \nprosperous times voters are more tolerant of diversity, more committed to \nfairness and expanding opportunity. As he puts it, \u201cEconomic growth bears moral \nbenefits.\u201d That suggests that Democrats should acknowledge that the economy has \ndone well since the Obama recovery in 2009. They should argue that this is the \ntime to take advantage of prosperity to begin a moral and social revival. This \nis the year to run a values campaign, one that champions policies to make \nAmerica more socially mobile, caring and interdependent. In 2020, running on \neconomic gloom or class war probably won\u2019t work. ",

            "full_text": " They Acquitted Trump. Make Them Pay! There\u2019s a way to\n make Senate Republicans regret their sins. By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist\n It is done. Donald Trump, impeached by the House of Representatives, has been \nacquitted by the Senate. He acted with corrupt intent to pressure the government\n of Ukraine to announce an investigation into the Bidens. He withheld \ncongressionally approved aid to do so. In so doing, he broke the law. Then he \ndid everything he could to obstruct the inquiry looking into his crime. He did \nthese things. This is not in question anymore. Everyone paying attention to the \nevidence presented and that which continues to be revealed in the press knows \nthis. Republicans in Congress know this. However, all but one \u2014 Mitt Romney \u2014 \nhave lined up behind Trump to support and defend him. What we have watched in \nWashington from Republicans during this impeachment is nothing short of a \ntravesty. Most people fully expected the Republicans in the Senate to do exactly\n what they did. However, it is still a strike against the country and the \nConstitution. Where are we? What\u2019s next? I, for one, am happy that the Democrats\n in Congress did what they did. Indeed, they had no choice. A line had to be \ndrawn and defended. If in fact no one in this country is supposed to be above \nthe law, that case had to be made by someone. If the sanctity of our elections \nis supposed to be inviolable, that principle had to be defended. Now that \nRepublicans have refused to do their duty out of extreme tribalism and devotion \nto Trump, Democrats need to make lists and take names. There is no time for \ncrestfallen recriminations. Republicans who have chosen party and despot over \ncountry and law must be made to pay at the ballot box in November. If a majority\n of the Senate cannot be expected or made to do the right thing, the Senate \nmajority must be changed. It must be defeated. This has long since stopped being\n solely about Trump. This is about the whole of the Republican Party. Indeed, \nthere is no longer a Republican Party. There is now only the Party of Trump. He \nis them; they are him. Sure, most Republican senators are safe this cycle, but \nsome are most definitely vulnerable. That vulnerability must be capitalized \nupon. They have to go. These are senators like Susan Collins of Maine, David \nPerdue of Georgia, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Martha \nMcSally of Arizona. Democrats and everyone else who believes in virtue must \nfocus like a laser on those races, even if they do not live in those states. \nThey must promote those senators\u2019 opponents on social media. They must donate to\n those opponents if at all possible. They must encourage people in those states,\n particularly friends and relatives there, to get out the vote. Anything that \ncan be done to oust these Republican senators must be done. These races are just\n as important as the presidential race. The impeachment trial gave Democrats \nammunition to use against these Republican senators facing voters in November. \nWith each vote Chuck Schumer forced on hearing new witnesses and collecting new \ndocumentary evidence, the incumbents put themselves on record in support of a \nsham process and a corrupt president. As Politico reported last month, \nDemocratic leaders think the Republicans will be seen as \u201cTrump sycophants \u2014 \nundermining their bids and boosting Schumer\u2019s odds of becoming majority leader.\u201d\n But Senate Democrats can\u2019t do this alone. They need an internet army to come to\n their aid. They need an unrelenting campaign of ordinary citizens to keep these\n vulnerable Republicans under pressure and in the spotlight. That means you! The\n resistance must be widened. Control of the Senate must be at the center. The \nSenate will be difficult to flip, but it is not impossible. And, like the \nimpeachment of Donald Trump, America has no real choice. ",

            "full_text": " Mike Bloomberg: Fixing Inequality Is My Priority \nRight now, the rewards of the economy are far too concentrated at the top. By \nMichael R. Bloomberg Mr. Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York City, is a \nDemocratic candidate for president. Every Democrat running for president agrees \nthat income inequality is one of the great problems of our time. And we all \nagree that the wealthy should pay more in taxes. But only one of us has actually\n raised taxes on the wealthy by persuading a Republican legislature to vote for \nthem: Me. When I was elected mayor of New York City, seven weeks after the \nterrorist attacks of Sept. 11, we faced a budget crisis and a recession. I had a\n choice: slash budgets and conduct mass layoffs, which would especially hurt the\n young, the elderly and low-income communities \u2014 or raise taxes. So I took the \npolitically difficult step of proposing tax increases, including one on those \nmaking more than $500,000 a year (about $700,000 in today\u2019s dollars). I \npersuaded a Republican-led State Senate and a Democratic-led State Assembly to \npass the bill, and a Republican governor to sign it. The extra revenue \u2014 roughly\n $400 million per year \u2014 allowed us to invest in our future and create jobs and \nopportunity in the neighborhoods where they were needed most. That is what \nleadership is all about: bringing people in both parties together to get \nresults. Over my 12 years as mayor, I also helped persuade Republicans in Albany\n to pass marriage equality, increase funding for public schools and enact \njuvenile justice reforms that helped lower the number of teenagers in \nconfinement. I\u2019m committed to helping Democrats win control of Congress this \nyear, regardless of the fate of my own campaign. And if, for whatever reasons, \nour party falls short of controlling both chambers of Congress, the next \nDemocratic president will have to reach across the aisle to end the Republican \nobstructionism that has gripped Washington for so long. That\u2019s not something \nthat most of my fellow Democratic candidates talk much about. Some of them \nprefer to shake their fists and point fingers, particularly when it comes to \ntaxing the wealthy. I agree with the goal of making the system fairer and more \nprogressive, including by increasing taxes on wealthy people like me. But I have\n a different approach, informed by my experience in both government and \nbusiness. Unlike President Trump, I didn\u2019t inherit my wealth, and I genuinely \nsupport causes I am passionate about: gun safety, climate change, women\u2019s \nrights, universal health care, education and yes, electing Democrats \u2014 including\n those in 2018 who helped create a majority in the House of Representatives, \nwhich laid the groundwork for holding this president accountable. I believe \nAmerica should always be a country where a middle-class kid like me can start a \nbusiness and succeed beyond her or his wildest dreams. But just as important, \nAmerica must always be a place where the middle class grows bigger and stronger.\n Right now that\u2019s not happening, because the rewards of the economy are far too \nconcentrated at the top. Part of the problem is global and macroeconomic. In \nnearly every industry, wages are mostly flat. Changing that will require major \nnew investments in our public schools to make sure that all high school students\n graduate with the skills they need to enter college or start a career. I\u2019ll \nmake that a top priority as president, as I did as mayor. The tax code is also \nworsening inequality. We tax income from stocks and bonds at a much lower rate \nthan income from work. We allow great wealth to pass from generation to \ngeneration with little or no tax due. And we provide countless loopholes that \ncorporations and the rich exploit to reduce their taxes even more. The tax plan \nI released on Saturday confronts these issues head-on. It reverses the \nRepublican tax cuts for high-income individuals. It adds a 5 percent surtax on \nincome over $5 million a year, bringing the top tax rate to 44.6 percent. It \nraises the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, from 21 percent, which is still \ncompetitive with other developed countries. It strengthens the minimum corporate\n tax on foreign income, to stop companies from moving profits overseas. And it \ncloses loopholes that companies and individuals exploit to avoid paying taxes. \nUnder my plan, the tax burden on the middle class won\u2019t increase, but for those \nearning more than $1 million a year, capital gains will be taxed as ordinary \nincome. This will end the unfairness of the wealthy paying far lower tax rates \non investment income than working Americans pay on income from their jobs. My \nplan also ends the carried interest loophole that allows money managers to \ncategorize their ordinary income as capital gains. And it ends a huge loophole \nthat allows the growth in the value of an estate to escape taxes at death, which\n benefits the wealthiest individuals. Unlike other candidates\u2019 plans that are \nlikely to be rejected by Congress or the courts, mine is achievable \u2014 and I will\n get it done. After all, who better to make the argument for raising taxes on \nthe wealthy than me? Some who are wealthy will call me a traitor to my class. \nBut that\u2019s what they called Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt. Like them, I\u2019ll \nwear the label as a badge of honor \u2014 and I\u2019ll use the new tax revenue, an \nestimated $5 trillion over 10 years, to invest in America in ways that reduce \ninequality, strengthen the middle class and restore faith in the promise of the \nAmerican dream. Michael R. Bloomberg, a Democratic candidate for president, was \nmayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013 and is the chief executive of Bloomberg\n L.P. ",

            "full_text": " The Triumph of Fiscal Hypocrisy What we can learn \nfrom Trump\u2019s deficitpalooza. By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist Donald Trump\u2019s \nre-election campaign will be centered around claims that he has done great \nthings for the economy. And let\u2019s be honest: The U.S. economy is running pretty \nhot these days. Growth in G.D.P. and employment has been good, though not \nspectacular; the unemployment rate is near a historic low. There are some \nshadows in the picture. Economic gains have been lopsided, with a large increase\n in corporate profits that mainly reflects giant tax breaks, while workers \nhaven\u2019t seen comparable gains (and gains for lower-wage workers have been driven\n in part by minimum-wage increases in blue states). The huge gains in health \ninsurance coverage under President Barack Obama have stalled or gone into \nreverse, and there has been a sharp increase in the number of Americans who \nreport delaying medical treatment because of costs. Still, it is indeed a strong\n economy. But if we ask what lies behind that strength, the main answer is an \nexplosion in the federal budget deficit, which exceeded $1 trillion last year. \nAnd the story of how that happened has deeply disturbing implications for the \nfuture of U.S. politics. Let\u2019s go back for a minute to early 2009, when the \neconomy was imploding and desperately needed help in the form of deficit \nspending. The Obama administration did indeed propose a significant stimulus \nplan \u2014 but it was much too small relative to the size of the problem, largely \nbecause the administration wanted to win bipartisan support and wasn\u2019t willing \nto use reconciliation to bypass the filibuster. This isn\u2019t hindsight. In January\n 2009 I was practically tearing my hair out over the inadequacy of the stimulus,\n and warned of a scenario in which \u201cthe plan limits the rise in unemployment, \nbut things are still pretty bad, with the rate peaking at something like 9 \npercent and coming down only slowly. And then Mitch McConnell says, \u2018See, \ngovernment spending doesn\u2019t work.\u2019\u201d That is, of course, exactly what happened. \nThen, in 2010, Republicans took control of the House and were in a position to \nforce Obama into years of spending cuts that exerted a significant drag on \neconomic growth. This drag wasn\u2019t enough to prevent a sustained economic \nrecovery, but the recovery could and should have been much faster. There was no \neconomic reason we shouldn\u2019t have returned to full employment by, say, 2013; \ninstead, largely thanks to fiscal austerity, the average unemployment rate that \nyear was still above 7 percent. Now, Republicans claimed that they were \ndemanding spending cuts because they were deeply concerned about budget \ndeficits. And the news media, I\u2019m sorry to say, both bought into the narrative \nthat deficits were our most important problem \u2014 abandoning the usual conventions\n of reportorial neutrality \u2014 and took G.O.P. claims of fiscal probity at face \nvalue. By the way, whatever happened to the deficit scolds who were so prominent\n during the Obama years? They\u2019re oddly quiet now. Anyway, it was always obvious \nto anyone who really paid attention that people like Paul Ryan were fiscal \nhypocrites, who would suddenly lose all interest in deficits as soon as a \nRepublican occupied the White House. And that\u2019s what they did. As I said, the \nbudget deficit has exploded past $1 trillion under Trump, up from less than $600\n billion in Obama\u2019s last year. Most of that rise can be attributed to Trump\u2019s \npolicies, mainly a tax cut rammed through Congress using exactly the \nhyperpartisan tactics Obama balked at in 2009. In a way, the surprising thing \nabout Trump\u2019s deficitpalooza is that it hasn\u2019t boosted the economy even more, a \nshortfall that can be attributed to bad design. After all, the corporate tax \ncuts that were the biggest driver of rising deficits did nothing to increase \nbusiness investment, which has actually declined over the past year. And while \nthe Obama stimulus included significant investments in the future, helping in \nparticular to jump-start revolutionary progress in green energy, Trump has never\n delivered a penny on his promise to rebuild America\u2019s infrastructure. Still, \nTrump\u2019s deficits have given the economy \u2014 and Trump\u2019s political fortunes \u2014 a \nlift in the short term. And that fact should bother you, a lot. Put it this way:\n Republicans used the pretense that they cared about fiscal responsibility to \nengage in de facto economic sabotage as long as a Democrat was in the White \nHouse. Then they abandoned the pretense and opened up the spending taps as soon \nas one of their own was in power. And far from paying a price for their \nduplicity, they are being politically rewarded. The implications for party \nstrategy are stark: Maximum cynicism is the best policy. Obstruct, disrupt, and \nhurt the economy as much as you can, deploying whatever hypocritical excuses you\n think the media will buy, when the other party holds the presidency. Then \nabandon all concerns for the future and buy votes once you\u2019re back in control. \nFor whatever reason, Democrats haven\u2019t been willing or able to behave that \ncynically. Republicans, however, have. And if Trump is re-elected, that \nasymmetric cynicism will be the main reason. ",

By DaVita Robinson, Valerie White and Maxine Crump Video by \nAlexander Stockton transcript Our Ancestors Were Sold to Save Georgetown. \n\u2018$400,000 Is Not Going to Do It.\u2019 In 1838, Georgetown University sold 272 people\n to Louisiana to save the university from bankruptcy. Among those that were sold\n were my ancestors. That university would not be here today had it not been for \nmy grandparents. That was a long time ago, but the effects of that are still \nfelt today. There are disproportionate negative outcomes for those who are \ndescendants of slaves that can only be explained by the fact that this \nenslavement happened, reparation didn\u2019t happen, and now is the time. In October,\n Georgetown University announced that they would raise $400,000 a year for the \ndescendants of the 272 enslaved Americans that were sold to Louisiana. They said\n this money will be spent beginning in the fall of 2020. My family might be \nmaking history in the United States. I might become one of the first in the \nhistory of America to receive reparations. Mechanicville is the area that is \nheavily populated with Georgetown descendants, including myself where I grew up.\n And Mechanicville is less than a half a mile away from where the plantations \nwere where our ancestors were enslaved. I mean, you had people on very low \nincome. Sometimes, they didn\u2019t have any income. Some of us have done well if we \nwere able to get out and get an education, and a lot of us haven\u2019t. And they \ncould really use some assistance or help. Mom? Hm? We might be the first that \nreceive some form of reparations for slavery. It may start with you. Well, I \nthink it would be a wonderful thing. Start out with me and then continue on with\n everybody who would be in need. There is so much I missed out on, but from the \ngoodness of God, I\u2019m still here. My mom \u2014 I will never forget \u2014 had one dress. \nShe\u2019d wash that dress out at night and hang it on the back of her chair to the \nfireplace to dry to have it to put on the next day. And my mom \u2014 patches on top \nof patches. So what do you think that \u2014 just maybe one thing you think that \nGeorgetown should do? Well, my house could be upgraded, for one thing. In my \ncommunity where I grew up, reparations would definitely help. If I was given \nreparations, I would definitely set some of that money aside for my son\u2019s \nfuture. My first thing is to get something for the elderly people. I would feel \nthat my ancestors are rejoicing in heaven. It\u2019s $400,000. For each family? No. \n[CHUCKLING] It\u2019s just $400,000 for over 7,000 people. Oh my. Not much. Do you \nthink $400,000 comes close to what we need as a people? So it\u2019s $400,000. Yes. \nO.K., so the descendants that\u2019s living now\u2014 you put that at how many, about \n8,000? There\u2019s about 8,000. There\u2019s probably more. Equal $50. $50. It\u2019s a slap \nin the face. Not just a slap in the face, that\u2019s a kick in the behind also. \nGeorgetown University is currently deciding how this money will be spent, but \nsaid it will go towards projects that support descendant communities. I think \nGeorgetown has such an opportunity here to take the lead on this. I don\u2019t think \nthey should go bankrupt, but $400,000 is not going to do it. Someone in \nauthority at Georgetown needs to come down and actually meet with each \ndescendant and see what each descendant needs. We don\u2019t need to make white \npeople wrong. We don\u2019t need to make Georgetown wrong. We need to ask ourselves, \nwhat do we need to do to ensure that all of Americans have full access to every \nright that it means to be an American? Georgetown University is one of the \ncountry\u2019s top-ranked schools and has a roughly $1.6 billion endowment. But in \n1838, the university was facing financial ruin. So the Jesuit priests, who ran \nGeorgetown, sold 272 enslaved people to three plantations in Louisiana for \n$115,000 \u2014 or the equivalent of about $3.3 million in today\u2019s dollars to keep \ntheir doors open. That\u2019s how the ancestors of DaVita Robinson, Valerie White, \nMaxine Crump \u2014 all descendants of the 272 and featured in the Video Op-Ed above \n\u2014 ended up in Louisiana. And now, they may become the first people in the \nhistory of the United States to receive reparations for slavery. In 2019, \nGeorgetown students pushed the school to create a reparations fund. Georgetown \nhas promised to raise $400,000 per year to go toward descendants of the enslaved\n people it sold. With more than 8,000 known descendants living today, is the \nschool\u2019s fund even close to what\u2019s owed? DaVita Robinson, Valerie White and \nMaxine Crump are descendants of the 272 enslaved people the owners of Georgetown\n University sold to Louisiana plantations in 1838 to save the school from \nbankruptcy.

            "full_text": " Think Trump\u2019s Learned a Lesson? Hahahaha Mitt Romney \nreally has a moment. By Gail Collins Opinion Columnist Pick the worst moment of \nthe Senate impeachment hearings: A) Susan Collins saying it\u2019s O.K. to keep \nDonald Trump in office because he\u2019s \u201clearned from this case.\u201d B) A spokeswoman \nfor Jim Risch claiming the senator was not sleeping but just \u201clistening with his\n eyes closed.\u201d C) Mitch McConnell denouncing partisanship. Well, the McConnell \nspeech during Wednesday\u2019s finale was pretty stunning. \u201cOur adversaries seek to \ndivide us against each other,\u201d the majority leader told his colleagues, warning \nthem not to become \u201cconsumed with partisan rancor.\u201d Nothing Mitch hates more \nthan failure to be politically evenhanded. It\u2019s probably one of the things he \nmulled frequently while sitting like a nesting hen on piles of Barack Obama\u2019s \njudicial nominations. Still, for the worst impeachment moment, I\u2019m going with \nSusan Collins. The idea that Donald Trump had learned any lesson is ridiculous. \nCollins knows \u2014 the whole world knows \u2014 that Trump is a man with a learning \ncurve that resembles a garter snake. On the same day she delivered her theory as\n an excuse for voting for acquittal, the president discussed his Ukraine-related\n behavior at a lunch with television anchors. What do you think he said? A) \u201cAll\n of life is a learning process.\u201d B) \u201cMaybe I might concede I could possibly have\n done a little better.\u201d C) \u201cIt was a perfect call.\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s C. You do know \nyour president, don\u2019t you? Collins had made a splash by voting in favor of \ncalling witnesses during the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial. We live in times when \nagreeing to listen to people who know a lot about the matter you\u2019re debating is \nan act of extreme daring. Of course, the witness thing failed. Some dark minds \nbelieve that Collins\u2019s moment of independence came only because McConnell knew \nhe had enough votes to kill the proposal without her. Collins is heading toward \na tough re-election in Maine this fall, and she needs bipartisan support. \nPerhaps, people of Maine, you haven\u2019t noticed that your senator\u2019s political \nindependence tends to work best when the matter at hand is meaningless. Could be\n worse. At least she respects you enough to pander. Many Senate Republicans \nsettled on taking Trump\u2019s side with a teeny tiny nod toward objectivity. (Lisa \nMurkowski went all the way for \u201cshameful.\u201d) A few red state Democrats had a \ntough time, too. Doug Jones, who won that dramatic special election in Alabama \nand is generally regarded as the most endangered Democratic senator this fall, \nsaid deciding to support conviction cost him a lot of sleep. \u201cThere will be so \nmany who will simply look at what I am doing today and say it is a profile in \ncourage,\u201d he told the Senate. \u201cIt is not. It is simply a matter of right and \nwrong.\u201d Well, also an understanding that Jones\u2019s surprise victory last time \naround was powered by a stupendous turnout by black women voters. Still, the \nCook Political Report instantly downgraded his chances for re-election. When the\n Senate voted to let Trump off the hook, the suspense had fizzled down to \nwhether Democrat Joe Manchin would take a dive and whether Republican Mitt \nRomney would take a principled stand. Manchin had tried desperately to find a \nway out by proposing the Senate merely censure the president for \u2026 trying to \nforce an ally to find dirt on Joe Biden by withholding congressionally approved \nmilitary aid. Nobody seemed to regard censure as a good plan, and Manchin voted \nto convict, depriving Trump of the chance to say he had bipartisan support. \nDemocrats of West Virginia, perhaps you find your senator a little slippery at \ntimes. But when you go to the polls, remember that one big day, he single-\nhandedly made Donald Trump a little sad. Romney, on the other hand, was an \nactual profile in courage. Mitt Romney! \u201cI knew from the outset that being \ntasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most\n difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong,\u201d he said emotionally. \nHe\u2019s going to get a lot of grief from his Republican supporters. Still, remember\n that this is a wealthy 72-year-old with five years to go on his current Senate \nterm. Over his career, Romney\u2019s had a history of taking principled stands and \nthen backing off when things get tough. The Mitt who ran for governor of \nMassachusetts was an entirely different entity than the one who ran for the \nRepublican presidential nomination. He was horrified by Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy\n \u2014 vowed never to vote for him. Then there he was dining with the president-\nelect, lusting after a cabinet post Trump had no intention of giving him. Now, \nhe\u2019s erased a lot of bad memories. \u201cCorrupting an election to keep oneself in \noffice is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one\u2019s oath of \noffice that I can imagine,\u201d Romney said, voting to convict on abuse of power. \nWhen history looks back on Mitt Romney, this should be the moment that gets \nremembered. Not the uninspiring presidential race or political flip-flops. Not \neven the time he drove to Canada with a dog on the roof of the car. ",

            "full_text": " Four More Years of Trump? After acquittal, the \nquestion is whether his good luck will last. By Spencer Bokat-Lindell Mr. Bokat-\nLindell is a writer in The New York Times Opinion section. This article is part \nof the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and \nThursdays. On Wednesday, Donald Trump became the third American president to be \nacquitted of impeachment charges. The vote fell almost entirely along partisan \nlines, with one exception: Mitt Romney became the first senator in history to \nvote to remove a president of his own party, triggering both the ire of his \nRepublican colleagues and the promise of a seven-figure book deal. Mr. Trump\u2019s \nacquittal came on the heels of a triumphalist State of the Union address and an \nuptick in his approval rating to 49 percent in one poll, the highest of his \npresidency. Here\u2019s how people are taking stock of the moment and what it means \nfor the 2020 election. \u2018Was impeachment a mistake?\u2019 Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s worst\n fears about impeachment have seemingly come to fruition, says The Dispatch. \nAccording to the latest Gallup poll, Mr. Trump\u2019s position has improved among \nboth Republicans and independents since impeachment proceedings kicked off last \nfall. \u201cDespite Trump\u2019s many and obvious weaknesses,\u201d The Dispatch says, \u201cit\u2019s \nclear that Democrats have their work cut out for them now more than ever as they\n endeavor toward taking back the White House this November.\u201d But Democrats had \nto pursue impeachment, and they pursued it as best they could, argues Robert \nKuttner, the editor of The American Prospect. There\u2019s no real evidence that it \nhurt the Democrats, he says, and it may still benefit them in congressional \nraces. There are as many as 11 Republican senators who may face tough re-\nelection campaigns, and \u201ctheir vote to excuse Trump\u2019s dictatorial behavior by \nrefusing to convict will force them to answer extremely damaging questions \nduring the campaign.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s acquittal could even backfire, Jonathan Chait \ncontends. The process was so stripped of legitimacy by Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s\n suppression of witnesses that it\u2019s now seen as a cover-up, which means \nDemocrats can continue their investigations. \u201cThey can keep digging into Trump \nfrom next week through fall, keeping public attention not only on his corruption\n and abuse of power but also on the Republican conviction that abuse of power is\n permissible,\u201d he writes. \u2018Voters don\u2019t trust him on health care\u2019 In his State \nof the Union speech, President Trump promoted his administration\u2019s health care \npolicies and claimed to have taken an \u201cironclad pledge\u201d to protect patients with\n pre-existing conditions as part of his effort to realize \u201cthe most affordable, \ninnovative and high-quality health care system on earth.\u201d The Trump \nadministration\u2019s health care agenda, however, has actually been malicious and \nincompetent, writes Catherine Rampell, a columnist at The Washington Post. \n\u201cWhile Democrats debate the best path to universal health coverage,\u201d she says, \n\u201cRepublicans appear to remain laser-focused on taking insurance away from as \nmany Americans as possible.\u201d Republicans fought in 2017 to repeal the Affordable\n Care Act, including its protections for those with pre-existing conditions. To \nthis day, Mr. Trump supports a lawsuit that would strike down the act. And just \nlast Thursday, his administration unveiled a plan to allow states to cut funding\n for Medicaid, which insures one in five Americans. But the Democrats risk \nforfeiting their natural advantage on the issue because of internecine policy \nfights, Michelle Cottle, a member of The Times editorial board, has written. The\n primary field remains starkly divided over \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a proposal that \nMs. Cottle argues might alienate swing voters and is unlikely ever to pass. \n\u201cMedicare for all has dominated the Democratic race for too long, serving \nneither the candidates nor the electorate well,\u201d she writes. Still, on this \nissue, all of the Democratic candidates compare favorably to Mr. Trump, writes \nMax Nisen. \u201cPete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders, currently in the lead from the \nwreckage of the Iowa caucuses, offer different visions for the future of \nAmerican health care,\u201d he says, but \u201cboth at least aim to boost coverage, a goal\n that Trump is incapable of or uninterested in accomplishing.\u201d And other polls \nhave found that Medicare for all is highly popular with people who voted for \nBarack Obama in 2012 but shifted their support to Mr. Trump in 2016. \u2018A roaring \neconomy\u2019 Mr. Trump is betting his electoral fortunes on the strength of the \neconomy, Gretchen Frazee reports, which is always top of mind for voters. \nPolitical scientists and pollsters she talked to said it\u2019s likely a good wager. \nThis is now the longest economic expansion in American history, as Megan \nMcArdle, a columnist at The Washington Post, has written: \u201cIt\u2019s not just strong \nretail sales but also high consumer confidence, strong employment and declining \nbankruptcy rates.\u201d A January New York Times survey found that respondents were \nthe most positive they had ever been about the economy in the three years the \nsurvey has been conducted. There\u2019s only about a one in four chance of a \nrecession happening in the next year, according to a Bloomberg estimate. \n\u201cAnalyses of past elections show that an improving economy \u2014 specifically a rise\n in gross domestic product \u2014 gives incumbent presidents like Trump a distinct \nadvantage,\u201d Ms. Frazee adds. [Related: Will the strong economy make Trump win?] \nBut Democrats shouldn\u2019t despair because the economy isn\u2019t as strong as it looks,\n writes Steven Rattner. Unemployment may be low but wages have barely budged, \njob growth is weakest in \u201cTrump country\u201d and income inequality continues to \ngrow. And whatever strength the economy does display, Mr. Rattner says, owes to \nMr. Obama. \u201cThe fact remains that little of what Mr. Trump has done has helped \nthe economy,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe challenges for most Americans remain steep. \nDemocrats need to keep reminding voters of those two simple facts.\u201d The activist\n Bree Newsome Bass tweeted: \u2018Trump is winning the 2020 Democratic primary\u2019 After\n the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic Party is facing a legitimacy crisis, writes \nSarah Jones. It became clear on Monday night that the caucuses had been badly \nmismanaged, which allowed conspiracy theories to breed. Into the void created by\n the party\u2019s own incompetence stepped Pete Buttigieg, who declared himself the \nvictor, and Joe Biden, whose campaign questioned the integrity of the election. \nThe party\u2019s \u201coverweening reliance on consultants, lack of a cohesive message and\n lackluster investment in its state affiliates render it weak and \ndysfunctional,\u201d Ms. Jones writes. \u201cIf Democratic loyalists are looking for \nsomeone to blame for the divisive reaction to Iowa\u2019s failures, they should blame\n the party itself.\u201d This crisis redounds to Mr. Trump\u2019s benefit, writes Eric \nLevitz, because the caucuses managed to confirm both progressives\u2019 suspicions of\n establishment bias and swing voters\u2019 skepticism about Democrats\u2019 claims to \nsuperior professionalism. \u201cIn sum,\u201d Mr. Levitz writes, \u201cWe are 24 hours into the\n 2020 campaign, and Democrats have already humiliated their party on national \ntelevision, alienated their least reliable progressive supporters, demoralized \ntheir most earnest activists, and handed Trump\u2019s campaign a variety of potent \nlines of attack.\u201d But in the end, the Democrats are still lucky to be facing Mr.\n Trump, Ross Douthat, a Times columnist, has written. Mr. Trump is not a Caesar \nor a king, Mr. Douthat says; he is a confidence man who exploited a decadent \npolitical system and got lucky. \u201cLiberal hand-wringing about their structural \ndisadvantages ignores the advantages that Trump keeps giving them,\u201d he writes, \nincluding \u201cthe fact that in the best economy in 20 years he can\u2019t stop making \npeople hate him, can\u2019t stop missing opportunities to expand his base, can\u2019t stop\n forcing vulnerable Republicans to kiss his ring and thereby weaken their own \nprospects.\u201d All the Democrats have to do, Mr. Douthat says, is beat him. Has he \n\u2018learned\u2019? On Tuesday, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, following her decision to\n vote for Mr. Trump\u2019s acquittal, said she believed he had learned \u201ca pretty big \nlesson,\u201d though she later clarified that it was \u201cmore aspirational on my part.\u201d \nIndeed it was: On Thursday, the president launched into a profane tirade about \nhis \u201cevil,\u201d \u201chorrible,\u201d \u201csleazebag\u201d political enemies and his \u201cbullshit\u201d \nimpeachment.

They\n are boring, chaotic, sometimes dangerously crowded, and sometimes \nembarrassingly ill attended. They punish introverts, parents, and anyone who \nworks. They torture the elderly and disabled and elevate the young, the loud and\n the bizarre. \u2026 I vow today never to participate again, assuming I can find some\n medication to control the guilt or the Iowa caucus dies after this year\u2019s \ndebacle.\u201d Beth from Iowa (via email): \u201cI am a registered Iowa voter who watched \nthis 2020 caucus debacle from Florida on CNN. I was left out of this process \nbecause there was no way for me to vote as an absentee. Many other Iowans were \nout of state as well because of the cold winter weather. \u2026 I believe that Iowa \nshould relinquish this outdated and confusing procedure and instead participate \nin a national ranked-choice American primary election, all on the same day.\u201d The\n Times is holding a letter-writing competition for high school students.
