It is hard to treat global warming very seriously when the plans do not include nuclear energy or even planting trees.  Why Did Jane Goodall have to bring it up.\n\nGlobal warming is a political tool designed to redistribute wealth rather than cure some type of real world problem.  It is based on the notion that poor people are somehow more affected by global warming than others, despite the fact that the proponents of solution say the entire world will end in 10 years if we don't completely redo our entire world.\n\nEven this article belittles the trillion tree planting.  The article says it is OK but will not solve the problem.  The position would make some sense if it were backed up with some data.  There is no estimate mentioned what would happen if the trillion tree planting is made, only a statement it isn't enough.\n\nThe proponents of radical changes to cure global warming really don't say much that makes sense.  I remember being told in the past that the world would turn colder and that we were in a warm period of earth history.  Whatever is happening, if anything, I like planting trees but don't want to throw anyone out of work by stopping oil and gas exploration.",

But he's happy you're talking about it like it was a serious proposal instead of a diversion.

He knows that some of his supporters will buy this line and will waste your time by arguing with you that Trump isn't actually the worst president for the environment since \"If you've seen one redwood tree, you've seen them all\" Reagan.",

How do we make the effort worthwhile and economically viable?\n History has several examples of humans confronting the diminishing-forest problem and finding solutions. The Tokugawa Shogunate period (late 1600s) in Japan was one example. Up to that time the forests in Japan were being depleted rapidly to provide income for landowners and building material and fuel for society. Here is the takeaway from a rather dense article (Tokugawa Shogunate Forestry) found online:\n \"The main point of the story is that Japan adapted to a deforestation crisis in the late 1600s by changing from unsustainable forest exploitation to managed and sustainable forestry.\"...\"Past civilizations with a deforestation crisis collapsed if they did not make the change from unsustainable forest exploitation to sustainable forestry (Diamond 2004). \"\nURL: <a href=\"http://world-history-education-resources.com/tokugawa-shogunate/tokugawa-forestry-shogunate.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-history-education-resources.com/tokugawa-shogunate/tokugawa-forestry-shogunate.html</a>\n\nGreat Britain also had a diminishing-forest problem about the same time, and solved it by replacing wood with coal and iron, so let's think long-term about how we are to solve this problem.

Have to assume so unless proven otherwise.\n\nWe have a big gaping hole in what we require of private landowners - we don't require any efforts or performance to actually enhance the ecological performance of their land (except in rare cases of endangered species on it).  Private land ownership is essentially a public trust arrangement - the public allows private land ownership in return for benefit to the public (just as the public allows corporations to be chartered with corporate ownership benefits to shareholders - that they'll not be personally liable for the organization's debts).  \n\nWhat should the public get in return for allowing private land ownership?  How about ecological improvements as a fundamental requirement?  \n\nGood that Nashville is waking up but to not require tree protections by single family home developers is rather a pathetic loophole.  Trees are a huge natural asset to us and birds etc - it is time we got serious about protecting them, and \"put down roots\" into requiring ecological protection by landowners - whether public or private.

I look at my trees with very different eyes from twenty years ago, I love them but I also see in them danger. People in our region are cutting mature trees by the hundreds that present a fire threat. And there is talk of clearing larger areas of the forest for fire breaks. Planning is difficult to do since Global Warming denial is make efforts very reactionary meaning we confront today's issues but refuse to recognize that we have a continuing warming trend that is baked in. As warming progresses the danger of bigger more intense wildfire increases. Clearly, climate change denial on the federal and international level makes everyday decisions difficult if not impossible to make. Our president's decision to encourage planting trees is a good thing but his inability to face the reality of global warming makes the situation grow worse. Efforts to plant trees will be overwhelmed by growing atmospheric pollution.",

Enormous swaths of  carbon-rich forests in the Southeast are being clearcut for so-called \"low-grade\" wood  that is ground up, pelletized, and shipped overseas where they are treated by EU policy as renewable, carbon-neutral fuel. The Drax power station in northern England collects more than $2 million a day in clean energy subsidies for burning these wood pellets instead of coal in its power plants. Here;s the kicker - not only is this practice terribly ecologically destructive, and results in huge forest carbon loss, but the emissions from these biomass power plants are far worse than coal - they are just not counted.  Trump's policies - and those of Congress - merely continue the biomass boondoggle.  One of the simplest ways we can protect forests is to stop giving out renewable and clean energy subsidies for burning them.",

A very common way to plant trees is to plant a great density of small trees, then thin them in a few years so the most promising have more room to grow, and then keep thinning them as they grow. Thin half twice and you have taken out 75%, common by the time they reach a very middling size at second thinning, maybe 15 years after planting.\n\nIf you don't thin them, then they thin themselves. The same numbers die, and often the same trees since they self select for promising dominant trees the same as we do, but they are not as efficient. It takes longer to resolve the struggle so, and they can damage the good trees as they die and come down.\n\nAs for carbon, all this is a good thing. Wood grows, and carbon is absorbed, according to the density of the canopy, not the numbers of trees in that canopy. Big healthy trees will take up as much carbon, and hold it longer, than a struggling overcrowded woodland in which the trees are choking each other.\n\nDensity of canopy is important to total carbon in trees. Tree grow upward, and hold more carbon per unit area, only when they need to grow upward to reach the light. A low spreading tree may be nice shade and pretty, but it does not have a towering trunk holding lots of carbon, just spreading roots and branches. Therefore scattered shade trees are not the same as a full woodland.",

This includes planting 800 native pecans, post oaks, blackjack oaks, and persimmons to make food for wild turkeys and deer. Yet, our state forestry department, while graciously selling inexpensive bare-root seedlings, gave virtually no practical instruction on how to plant or care for them. Consequently, only about 200 have survived, and only about 40 are what you'd call \"prospering\". Over the past decade, I've had to learn the hard way about soil types, preferred moisture, underground critter damage, leaf diseases, flooding, drought, high winds, and bagworms and walnut caterpillars that can strip a 12-foot-high tree bare in a single week.\n\nThe point I'm making is that those of trying to do something by planting trees need some kind of central information repository where we can easily go and find out how to successfully plant things in any given geographic location, without having to spend countless hours learning by trial, error, and exhaustive Internet search.",

The grove was mowed down and replaced by post war housing - each house was left with a couple of citrus trees in the backyard. Ours still produce like gangbusters. But over the years the main streets, front and back yards became denuded of their flora for the sake of bigger homes and broader sidewalks.

Our once naked main boulevards are now lined with trees. All new construction has to meet water saving regulations. Putting in a drought tolerant native garden is not only chic - but the city will help fund it. If you use too much water to keep your thirsty English garden alive in the desert you get fined.

So, when you move into a home, go out and see what shrubs are there.  Add to them.  Cut back on lawn and install islands of shrubs, small trees, other trees that will grow large over time. Add ground covers, flower gardens full of perennials that grow well in your area.  Set aside a plot for vegetables and get your kids out to help plant and tend them. Kids tend to eat what they grow. So, the effort will teach them to eat healthy. Join with neighbors to plant hedges between homes.  They create privacy, give shelter to animals and keep adding that oxygen. All of this will add beauty and financial value to your home.  So, go for it and send questions to your local agricultural station, where people like me serve as volunteers. You really CAN help!",

Yes, we are fighting against overpopulation, increasing water shortages, and rampant destruction of wide swaths of forest, however, planting trees is a common sense effort that can provide a wide range of benefits in an urban/suburban setting. Trees, once established, slow down storm water runoff allowing it to seep into the water table rather than running off into storm drains and into nearby aquifers. Trees shade cement and macadam to reduce the heat island effect and, thereby, reduce cooling needs and the concomitant energy requirements. Trees also clean the air, quiet sound and slow down traffic in residential neighborhoods to make them safer. Trees provide other benefits, but the point is that planting trees is something many people can do while others work to reduce overpopulation and other environmental problems.",

This is an example of force of will usurping the rule of law or the desires of the polity.  Trump rules with an ethos of \"I will do as I please (without policies) and force others to stop me.\"  What is remarkable are the many compromises his constituency has made to perpetuate fealty to the supreme leader.  Certain people like power, like to attach themselves to it, worship it and do anything necessary to perpetuate it and in so doing ensure their own self image of cultural and political supremacy.  This is not about public policy.  Bernie's policies are no more radical than FDR's (even Nixon wanted universal healthcare access).  But Bernie (and to an extent Warren) is a threat to both the powerful and the angry, sheep-like downtrodden Trumpists - and this is unacceptable to this coalition of appeasers.  This election will be about will and about which candidate, party and voters see their own well being linked to the pugilist who demonstrates superior indifference to maturity and ethics.  It will be infuriating at best, horrifying at worst.  Wish us luck.",

They know that the majority want government programs that make their lives easier or which improve their well being, so the right-wing agenda is to ensure that the majority cannot vote to overrule the elites they want to put in charge. The GOP agenda has been to eliminate (not just cut back) Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, employer-provided pensions and insurance, public schools, voting rights, and environmental and other government regulations that protect air, water, and consumer rights. This all goes back at least to the 1994 Contract with America, but it has been in the works even longer. As noted in the article, Trump is willing to support all aspects of this agenda as long as he can continue to enrich himself in the process by using the presidency for his private gain. This agenda has been documented in many recent books. Nancy MacLean's Democracy in Chains, focuses especially on James Buchanan who provided the intellectual rationale for these goals. She says quoting Buchanan (p. 149-50): \"Why must the rich be made to suffer?\" he asked pointedly. If \"simple majority voting allowed the government to impose higher taxes on a dissenting individual in the minority . . . what distinguished that from \"the thug who takes his wallet in Central Park?\"",

Most of the nation\u2019s ills can be traced directly to that horrible turning point in our history,\n\nSince then, the two parties have been flipped on their heads. The so-called \u2018Party of Lincoln\u2019 has become the party of the wealthy and the trusts, i.e., big banks, wealthy investors and corporations. And it has not only absorbed but has been dominated by the Dixiecrats of the former Confederacy - thus its stranglehold on the politics of Alabama, Mississippi, et al. But for its transformation from the \u201cParty of Lincoln\u201d into its polar opposite, the Republican Party likely would have ceased to exist more than a century ago.\n\nLike the Southern Democrats of yesteryear, the GOP of the 21st century leverages willful ignorance, xenophobia and racism to stay in power. It relies on a sleight of hand - while purporting to be \u2018the party of the little guy\u2019 and \u2018the party of freedom,\u2019 it screws the little guy and tramples on our freedoms. That\u2019s the strategy that wealthy Southern slave owners and industrialists used to subjugate and exploit dirt poor, uneducated white sharecroppers to their own detriment and send them off to die in the Civil War; and that\u2019s the Republican Party of Trump today.\n\nIf Lincoln came back today, he\u2019d curse the whole lot of them.",

Reagan said, If you are not happy with your situation, vote for me. Trump said, at his lying best, vote for me and I'll bring your jobs back.\nI hope it doesn't take another 40 years to realize that they were both con men, touting the same Republican policy.\nIt's really hard to get your mind around the fact that American corporations would intentionally outsource American jobs to increase their profits.

It\u2019s this strategy where you start a conversation with an effort to attain your goals end typically end up in a compromise of sorts that is less than you hoped for, but better than simply going for your negotiating partner\u2019s opening position. You know how negotiation does *not* work? Starting from a compromise (and compromised!) position, because then that becomes your starting point and you end up with much, much less than what you wanted. This is the \u201cObama\u201d mentality: \u201clet\u2019s propose a center-right solution like Romneycare in order to convince Sue Collins and Olympia Snow to vote for it, even though we explicitly do not need their votes.\u201d Buttigieg promises to be precisely the same (if not worse) - come on, Krugman, you know better for this - I know that you do because you usuallu express more reasonable ideas - when Sanders isn\u2019t running for president at least.",

There's no real hope of converting any significant number of Trump voters to vote for any Democratic candidate, no matter who that candidate is.

While the average US salary may be $47,000 a year, for those in the service industry (representing 44% of the workforce and 53 million people) the average is only $30,500. In most places, this is not nearly enough to live, much less raise a family, pay for emergencies, pay for college or vacations and certainly not enough to save for retirement. The fact thatTrump and the media keeps telling people that the economy is so good has made people believe it, even though it is no better than it was 8 years ago. If people are employed, but have to work three jobs and still fall behind, is that a strong economy? If the wealth and income gap continue to expand at a rapid pace, is that not a recipe for disaster. I ask Dr. Krugman and his media colleagues to be more circumspect when describing the econmy. Let's look beyond the rhetoric or the outdated metrics used to measure the economy. People need the truth before the election.",

Trump.\n\nAs regards manufacturing jobs, in Jan 19 the following market watch article reports \"Some food for thought: the U.S. had as many people working in the manufacturing sector in December as it did 69 years ago.\n\nThe 32,000 positions added in December took the total number of positions in manufacturing to 12.84 million. In November 1949, there were 12.88 million manufacturing workers, at the end of a sharp recession.\"\n\nIn view of this statistic above I think that after period of rapid growth some decline in manufacturing jobs is not a unexpected phenomenon.\n\nI would be inclined to invest more credibility in Prof.'s Krugsmans views if he was not such a reliable contra-indicator.\n\nNot content with this record of economic predictions, Prof. Krugman is happy to share his mind-reading abilities with his reading public. \"My guess, however, is that Trump\u2019s trade policy has been motivated less by any substantive goals than by the desire to look like a tough guy.\" His ability to read the President's mind and to so divine his \"real\" intentions mark Paul out as a man of rare and hidden talents.

If Trump did not deliver on what he promised to his supporters then Democrats should inform them of this - and not treat them as deplorables, racists, bigots, fools who don't know what's in their own interest. After all, many of his campaign promises then still make sense. If he sold out to the Republican establishment it is opportunity knocking for Democrats - unless they still prefer to represent the socially liberal, professional class rather than the working class and America's \"have nots\".\n\nFortunately, the curtain is being pulled back on the Democrat establishment. They can't keep pretending that they represent the under-privileged and under-educated (except if they belong to a nonthreatening minority group dissimilar to them). The working class and true progressives that represent them will make establishment Democrats either get on-board with serious economic reforms - or stop pretending and join the Republican party.\n\nThe pretense is working on fewer and fewer people. After the last debate, Elizabeth Warren repeatedly attacked \"the rich\" in an interview. All six of the moderators accepted this without question even though Ms. Warren has probably been a millionaire for forty years (since her days as a Republican). But much of America wouldn't be surprised by this because they KNOW none of these people shop at Dollar General.",

My point is this - Rich Republicans like Bob could care less about integrity, abortions, or supporting the military or anything else; that is all lip service the get votes from snowflake conservative-culture-warriors still fighting for a return to Jim Crow era America.

That these tax cuts hurt the Americans they claim to care about is incidental.  \n\nHowever, my fears are more than financial at this point.  Given his acquittal my concern is that no matter what happens in November, he will be a problem.  If he loses he'll say the election was rigged.  He might decide not to leave the White House.  (And I see the GOP supporting him in that.  McConnell has a lot to lose if Trump doesn't win.)  Or if he does accept his loss, he'll destroy as much as he can before he's out.  Trump and the GOP have been extremely lucky so far.  The economy has been upbeat because of how Obama left it, not because of anything Trump did.  It would be poetic justice if he wins and the economy goes sour.  \n\nThe GOP has never had the interests of 99% of us in mind.  Its policies and platforms work for the richest who can afford to pay for the best medical care, who don't live paycheck to paycheck, who have deep pockets and will survive almost anything.

Buttigieg and Bernie are both extreme candidates and Trump's dream opposition in November. \n\nBoth states need to be moved to April until they get over Bernie fever. Iowa especially has shown it is too white and too fringe to be the Dems first primary. Losing the general this time will put our country over the chasm and many of us on death beds over the same old sick, sadistic trickle down. There is too much liberal PC here.

But they do not know to say that, they just react tow act they see.  They respect and like Joe, they are worried that Joe may not win.  They look at their 401 K's.",

If the gov spent more money in such a way it got to the non-rich, that would increase production which would compensate for the inflationary effect of more gov spending.The proposals of the progressive candidates not only get money to the right people, but they help solve pressing problems, e.g. our horrendous healthcare system, climate heating, decrepit infrastructure, etc.\n\nSending money to the Rich only increases financial speculation. What's a guy or gal who already has so many houses he can't remember how many & an elevator for his horse gonna spend his money on? The answer is he is going to use it to speculate. This explains why GDP growth is glacial while the stock market is exploding.\n\nIf you are worried about the debt look at history. The highest the debt ratio ever was was in 1946 when it was 121%. This was followed by 27 years of Great Prosperity. Compare this with post WWI. From 1946 - 1973, we INCREASED the debt in dollars by 75%, but the gross debt ratio DECREASED to 32%. After WWI we DECREASED the debt in dollars by almost 40%, By October of 1929, the debt ratio was only 16%. And then what happened?",

Or, if all the groups that our government must acknowledge and work with were simply accepted as people.  And if they would realize that first, they are Americans, and most of what good this government gives is not so bad for us all.  Americans make governance hard since we speak as individuals, and do not always consider whether our personal 'want' may be good for many.  Affordable healthcare is good for many.  Affordable college education is good, and even better since students would not be saddled with debt that leaves them small chance to live decently.  Affordable housing is good for many.  Returning to my first statement about homogeneity.  That was a \"throw-out\".  There are supremely marginalized people in our country. When they are in the mainstream, when they are a part of this country without apology or defense, then we begin to have a workable government for all.  If we acknowledge we cannot have roads, infrastructure that is current and working, water that is clear without paying for it, and that all who live in this country and use those roads and switch on those lights and drink the water, must be part of the payment.  What could I do if I had a business that saw a bottom line that showed millions or billions.  I would spread it over my staff and this country like manure on farmland.  Money is power to a few.  To me, money is money and meant to be used.",

A reader, max, said in a reply to one of my comments:\n\n\"So much of our economic issues could be solved if people understood that the US cannot run out of money, and how hard it is to cause hyperinflation from government spending alone.\"\n\nLet me show that max got it right.\n\nFirst gov operations, militarily, infrastructure, etc. are NOT paid for or limited by taxes or borrowing.\n\nThe gov doesn't need your money. It can (thru the FED) create as much as it needs out of thin air. Unless you have a printing press in your basement, you can't do that.\n\nBut there's a catch. If the gov needs to create too much money to do the things we want it to do, we may not be able to make enough stuff to soak that money up & will have too much money chasing not enough stuff, i.e. excessive inflation.\n\nBut that's easy to solve & where taxes come in. Taxes allow the gov to take back the excess money & prevent inflation. \n\nThe purpose of taxes is to adjust the amount of money in the economy.\n\nNow if production is constrained say by a shortage of oil, we may not be able to tax enough. That's we we get hyperinflation.\n\nSince federal spending sends money to us & taxes take it back, the deficit is just the net amount of money the gov sends to the private sector & the debt is just the algebraic sum of all the money the gov has sent over time.\n\nUnderstand this, and we can talk.",

In it's most basic form it can be summarized as follows: \"I don't have that, why should you, I take pleasure in seeing you lose it\". Trump plays on this emotion by revving up his base to believe the recipients were never deserving of the benefit in the first place, or we're rewarding laziness.  The targeted benefits so far have been things like healthcare, food stamps, and delayed immigration processing. Now Medicaid appears in his cross hairs...even with 36 states relying on the funds. He characterizes these programs as budget busters.  For these folks there is no advocate or the advocacy is diffused and not well organized. Trump knows Congress will stop some of the cuts but he is just testing to see what he can get away with.  In the end, for Trump, it's all a game. His actions ( successful or not) play to and solidify his base of support. Pretty sad really. Pathetic. Like him.",

But you yourself say that \"trickle down\" needs to end, and you yourself have praised the Scandnavian countries as models if healthy systems, so it's odd that you demonize Sanders. Or are you being told to do it by your editorial board?\n\nIn any case, Sanders can certainly \"walk and chew gum at the same time\", and has pointed out Trump's failures while advocating his own solutions. Why don't you and the MSM stop trying to make this a \"referendum\" on MFA, and report on ALL the aspects of his candidacy, and quit trying to sabotage him? That's what true journalists would do.",

The proof? He has delivered on none of his promises, and yet his voters are ready to hand him a second term.\n\nThe gloves need to come off when describing Trump voters. In most columns, they are treated as entirely innocent bystanders who had nothing to do with this train wreck of a presidency, or hapless dupes where were \"suckered.\" They are neither. They knew exactly what they were voting for when they voted for Trump.\n\nThanks to the kowtowing Republican Senate, there is now literally nothing stopping Trump. He is now limited only by his imagination and the laws of physics. This disgusting man, who spews racist remarks at every opportunity, and tells his followers that the KKK and neo-Nazis are some very fine people, has a base of tens of millions of people who adore him.\n\nAnd why wouldn't they?

We are dealing with two shades of corrupt, $angerous and Machiavellian leaders.  One is a devil and the other is an ignorant devil by extension.  Whoever the Democratic candidate is he or she must have a 1) profound understanding of Russian viciousness and its voracious appetite and 2) a steel backbone to withstand Russia.  \n\nAnd, I posit that the only Democrat in this presidential race who suffers zero fools and then some ... is Mike Bloomberg.  He has the wherewithal to see when and if to punch and where to punch when needed.  He can do this with a White House full of capable men and women who are currently strong in the Democratic Party. \n\n(I have a profound respect for Secretary Albright.

But I suggest it has much to do with the US policy toward Iran.\n\nWhile he was campaigning in 2016 and later as the US president, Mr. Trump was signaling his strong desire to improve US-Russian relationships.  He wanted a \"cooperative\" relationships with Russia, apparently for a single purpose: for Russians to acquiesce with regime change in Tehran.  \n\nIn fact, in more than one occasion, Trump implicitly offered removal of US economic sanctions on Russia in exchange for Russian collaboration with the US on Iran.  And it was not an accident that when Russian ambassador to the US visited the White House, he was carrying the book: \"Going to Tehran\". \n\nThe notion that such a \"deal\" was possible was undoubtedly planted in Trump's head by the Israelis.  It was designed to appeal to Mr. Trump who was eager to demonstrate his ability to strike \"deals\" that others could not.  And that may also explain Mr. Netanyahu's many trips to Russia in the last four years. \n\nPutin has made it clear that Russia has now its own Monroe doctrine.  Under no condition he would allow a pro-American regime in Iran, Syria, or Turkey.  Not only that, if the US attempts to invade Iran, Russia will join Iranians in a military conflict against the US.",

That's solely about obvious physical destruction from blast and fire, that's a viable assertion in some sense. However, one can never avoid fallout in a nuclear war. It's inevitable.\n\nIt's often thought that the massive destruction nuclear war would bring is what threatens life as we know it. No doubt that's a possibility, but even a \"small\" nuclear war could doom us. via fallouy. \n\nIn the AEC's 1949 study associated with Project GABRIEL, the question was raised about how much destructive yield could be dropped on the Russians  without affecting the US. Turns out it was a rather small number, 60 megatons,  before globally threatening effects start cropping up in comparison to the forces that soon became available. Such strike totals are within the capabilities of most nuclear states, with only North Korea lagging (for now.) \n\nThis dissertation explains the often overlooked fallout problem.\n<a href=\"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/90554\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/90554</a>",

Of the dehumanization of being held to the functional and productivity standards of a robot, every second of her work time monitored and evaluated for efficiency.  \n\nAnd that part where she describes the vending machines that dispense OTC pain meds for free when workers swipe their badges, to pop like candy to quell the overwhelming physical aches and pain of the work?  Is that really true?  If not I'd push back hard; if yes, well you folks running Amazon are one sick group of people in my opinion.\n\nYou're not that much younger than me, so probably you too have familiarity with the original Star Trek TV series.  Might pull up an episode (probably available on Amazon Prime) called \"The Cloud Minders.\" (The people of Stratos City look down on the earthbound slaves who work their mines, their callous exploitation horrifying Capt Kirk.)",

Part of the coping entailed silly, ritualized kvetch-humor about politics and economics.

If Amazon would just stay out of more of the few businesses that are still dominated by mom and pop stores, if there are any. I seem to remember books stores being one of those. But that was a long, long time ago, in an economy far away. \nI believe that Amazon uses data gathered from its independent sellers to identify sales trends. If they see an uptrend in a high margin business, they go in direct competition with the independent. They are very much like an in-house foreign competitor. True, they do employ Americans. Of course that's out of pure necessity, isn't it? \nHow do they treat their employees? Well, there have been stories of them working people like dogs. A few months ago I had an Amazon truck pull up in front of my house. After it had stayed there for 1/2 hour or so, I looked out and saw the driver hunched over the wheel, motionless. When I checked again in a few minutes he hadn't moved. His head was still resting in the middle of the steering wheel. I went out and knocked on the window. The guy finally moved. He rolled down the window. When I asked how he was he said he was really sick, but would be moving soon. The guy looked like hell warmed over, cooled, and warmed over again. He stayed hunched over, sleeping/resting, for another 10 minutes and left. So, that was something.",

It is good to have a likeminded ally like Jay Carney in the upper echelon of Amazon. I am glad that he realizes that $15 is not a livable hourly wage. The time has come for America and the developed world to eliminate impoverishment. There is no sound moral or economic justification for us to tolerate it in the 21st century. Impoverishment is the ultimate source of many of our social ills. Americans must insist on policies and practices in the public and private sectors that move us toward this objective and not away from it.

How many of each of these sorts of jobs we want the economy to provide should be one criterion for the sorts of laws and regulations we make, but right now our criterion is which can survive and make more money.  We have decided to judge businesses on profitability and on how much opportunity they provide for investors to make money, rather than on what sort of human beings they enable their workers to be while they are at work.  \n\nWe have given control of our lives to an ahuman system that runs on the basis of some human values while ignoring others because it can create more goodies.",

If capitalism involves competing with  customers, employees, and vendors for who gets the money from the transactions, but not winning these competitions and making them offers they cannot refuse, then capitalism needs an external force to preserve it and without that force it morphs into something else.  \n\nThe internet by nature is one huge shopping center within easy reach of everyone; as such it should be a public utility rather than privately controlled by one of its vendors.",

First of  all, let\u2019s recognize that while Amazon can rightly claim bragging rights to creating more jobs than any other corporation in America, a significant number of those jobs were created out of the destruction of small businesses that Amazon\u2019s very business model displaced. Sure, new technology oftentimes leads to the diminishment or destruction of older, less efficient (a relative term) businesses. This is an economic reality of capitalism. However, claiming Amazon as America\u2019s great job creator is only half the story. Mr. Carney\u2019s claim that Amazon has 500,000 employees lacks precision. A great number of these employees are part-time and/or seasonal employees. Part-time staff do not have access to the same benefits as those highly paid software engineers, marketing and other full-time positions. Moreover, Amazon and its Amazon-owned affiliates (Whole Foods, Prime Now Shoppers, and other entities), purposefully restrict the number of work hours available to each employee in order to prevent them from qualifying under federal and state laws to be considered eligible for full-time benefits. So, while Amazon has every right to conduct its business within the law, let\u2019s not allow Mr. Carney to mislead you in believing that Amazon is any better or more enlightened than its competitors.",

If they evenly distribute wage increases (not real world, but it makes easier arithmetic) in $1 increments, that costs them 1.5 billion dollars world wide for each dollar of increase.  Or it decreases their net income by 12.5%.  Do that eight times and you are going broke.\n\nThey report a gross profit of 74 billion, they spend a tremendous amount on Research and Development and General and Administrative expenses.  In other words, they have consistently plowed an enormous amount of money into building their business. \n\nAmazon has become as large as it is by competing in a relatively low margin business.  An additional employee, following their business model is worth about $15,000 of profit.  It takes a very large amount of money to set up the situation that will allow them to hire that next employee.\n\nMaybe they can do better.

If the highest it can go is $15 per hour, then doesn't that suggest that other less-profitable companies may not be able to have a minimum wage that high and still be profitable?\n\nSecond, Amazon's (and other companies') decision to raise their minimum wage shows that when there is a favorable business climate, employers often pay low-skilled workers well in excess of the federally mandated minimum.  \n\nThose in favor of an increase to $15 per hour need to understand that this is a 100% increase over the current minimum wage, and that such a rapid and massive increase could have some serious negative economic consequences.  An increase of the minimum wage likely is overdue, but the increase should be gradual and modest in size in order to minimize the negative externalities.  An increase to $15 per hour could further erode an already diminished tax base, which would further reduce the government's ability to provide support to those in need.

Maybe, but more likely maybe not.\n\nAmazon (like any retailer or service provider) is not a net wealth generator or job generator except under certain conditions - their existence actually stimulates more spending than people would do otherwise (without their existence).  And from the standpoint of a national economy - the effect depends on where the products it stimulates more consumption of are made - i.e. if their operations stimulate more spending, but it is for foreign products, they might be a net negative impact on the local economy.\n\nWealth is created when humanity converts something of nature into something of value to humans.  The rest of us (including me) just spread around wealth created that way.  Our economy's unsustainability is fundamental - we are using up natural capital and resources.  As noted nearly 50 years ago by \nEF Schumacher, were are consuming our capital and confusing that for income - and that any business what consumes its capital will soon be out of business.  \n\nSo Amazon, I challenge you to do an actual net impact study of your operations on the US economy.

Indeed, I'm sure Bernie himself wouldn't be too happy about the title of this piece. Just because he's happy about the increase in the minimum wage, doesn't mean he endorses Amazon's many other activities.",

Fifteen dollars an hour is barely a livable wage in my city. The tuition payment program, \"Career Choice\", only covers a two year certificate program. Amazon insists that it's not using Career Choice to sever their own needs and encourages its employees to study a subject they are \"passionate about\"; that is, so long as it's one of the approved certificates from the short list curated by the company. And must be done of a 40 plus hour work week. It's no wonder only about 5% of employees use this benefit. It feels like the company store of the 21st century.\n\nSo while Amazon preens and tells us how much good we all owe them for, remember that these \"associates\" (a shameful thing to call the people on whose sore feet your company runs) have no say about how they spend their hundreds of hours a year at work. Amazon is hostile to their unionization efforts because they might actually be forced to give them what they deserve. And as they earn their good-enough-for-now wage those at the top earn as much as all of us combined, many times over.",

Doing the right thing for workers should not be confused with the company doing what it needed to do to hire the people it wants. Just look at Taco Bell\u2019s recent decision to pay its store managers $100K a year.\n\nSecond, Amazon loves to cite how many jobs it has created. But raw job creation must be analyzed in the context of how many jobs Amazon has eliminated, too. The company\u2019s negative effects on small businesses is well-documented, but even employees of larger companies are losing out. I think Macy\u2019s decided to close over 100 of its stores last week, at least partly due to competition from Amazon.\n\nFinally, Amazon\u2019s business model is based on change and innovation. That\u2019s good, except that Amazon will not hesitate and has not hesitated to close a fulfillment center once it stops making sense for the company\u2019s bottom line. The community and its workers are then left with nothing, except perhaps training \u201ccertificates\u201d to use in a different town. And in the long run, there will be few workers to speak of assuming that any of Amazon\u2019s many research investments in labor-saving robotic technology pay off.",

In brief, employers make all the decisions as to what that person does during those eight hours with very little input from the workers as well as to what they are paid, what they get for vacation, health insurance, etc. Massive control of the workers life. The Board of Directors, about 12 to 15 people decides everything involving the workers life for that 8 hours a day. They get well paid as do the share holders. The worker is at the bottom. No democracy. This huge part of the workers life in a country that supposedly was founded on \"freedom and democracy.\"\nIt is a system that needs to go like  earlier economic systems; it is in fact failing.

While Amazon matches 401(k) donations (up to 4 %), there is (silly me!) no such thing as an Amazon defined benefit pension plan. And as Carney admits $15/hour is not really that much - certainly not enough for a family wage. (I doubt those at the $15/hour level have any $$ left to contribute to their 401ks.)\n\nCan anyone say \"let's unionize!\" ???\n\nFinally, while yes, of course, Amazon avails itself of tax loopholes/deductions just like any other normal American (corporation) does - and therefore ends up paying zilch in federal corporate taxes - don't for a second imagine that Amazon does not also lobby for every kind of loophole imaginable. \n\nWe have all drunk the Kool-aid if we think that the Amazon model is the best we can do.",

It\u2019s also disingenuous to put it on Warren and Sanders to raise  the federal minimum wage when the Senate is controlled by the anti-labor party that promotes the philosophy of an employee\u2019s \u201cright to work.\u201d Please don\u2019t insult the intelligence of many Times readers. You can\u2019t fool all of us all of the time. Sadly, you worked for Democratic President and now you\u2019re bragging about Amazon\u2019s altruism for labor and it\u2019s benevolent concern for America. Amazon had a choice to raise the minimum wage or face unionization in states where there exists no fictitious \u201cright to work.\u201d",

But of course you're not alone. All of Corporate America shares in the blame for how the economy doesn't work for the majority of Americans. Ironically, if you corporate vultures took a bigger view beyond your bottom line you'd see that when the consumers share in the wealth they help to create, they tend to spend it and that increases your profits.

Taken into account must be the incentives given by state and local governments such as tax abatement and \"fee in lieu of\" so that a fair appraisal is done. To simply say they pay nothing is ridiculous. They must enlist surrogates that will put together a program that is good for business, good for their employees, and good for local economies.

There is nothing good about cold, overly steamed broccoli or cold saut\u00e9ed chickpeas...and on what planet do chick peas go with pizza? Most of the food that is served is overly processed and unappetizing, and while it is cooked, at our school, it is seldom warm. There is a salad bar, though very few kids eat from it, and fresh fruit is forced upon the kids, but what can a kindergartner do with an unpeeled orange?  They go right into the trash because the kids \u201ccan\u2019t get the fruit out.\u201d  This article was a joke.  I\u2019d also like to point out that many of the kids that are served by the free lunch program don\u2019t have access to good quality food at home and so healthier choices are foreign and therefore less palatable to them.  As with everything in education in this country, this seems to be a race to the bottom.  Your kid eats garbage so mine should to?  No thanks.",

YouTube & other social media has had a POSITIVE effect on what we feed our children. YouTubers present wonderfully creative & nutritious ideas for school lunches, healthy budget meals, grocery hauls, shopping tips, etc. Yes, this fosters some competition among parents (like with everything else these days)...but at least the end result is better nutrition. School hot lunches are improving in part fueled by social media/parent expectations & we should keep up the good fight for high quality standards. It has never been the cultural norm in America for schoolchildren to all eat the same school provided hot lunch (as it has been in other countries).  I think one other factor not mentioned here is that it is not unusual for a schoolchild to begin his/her school day at 7:00 am and not arrive home until after 6 pm. Parents feel the need to pack a school lunch that is individualized to their child's taste and appetite (aftercare may not provide a substantial snack).....and like many have mentioned, a packed lunch does represent an act of parental sacrifice (making, packing, purchasing) and love which does not go unnoticed in the life of a child.",

I will say that school lunches have improved in the past decade BUT the bar was pretty low to begin with. While we now have a fresh salad bar with our own school garden-grown greens and tomatoes that many kids do choose to sample, most of the lunches are the same foods from our own school days with a slight upgrade- The pizza crust is whole wheat, and there are more fresh fruits offered.  The cooked veggies are often soggy and many days canned fruit is served.  Nachos and breaded chicken nuggets, hamburgers and french toast sticks still dominate the menu.  The PB&J offered are the very sugary Uncrustables by Smuckers. Chocolate and Pink milk are offered alongside 2% and 1%white milk.  Which do you think the children choose? Quite a few kids who buy lunch often say they don't like it and throw at least some of it away. I do urge them to take uneaten bananas and apples home. My own teenager bought lunch once in 1st grade and then said never again. She has eaten a home packed lunch every day and she is a junior. Even the high school lunches are unappealing.  I will say that most parents ARE packing healthier home-made lunches these days, but there are still so many lunchboxes packed with nothing but Doritos, cookies, donuts, fruits gummies, sugary granola bars and crackers. That's a whole other topic!",

Much of what I've taken from the book is that we need to recognize that investment in the policies and programs we want to have access to is where America has failed in recent decades.  School lunch is exactly this.  Most everyone sees the need to provide a more wholesome lunch for students. For some kids, there is not a parent at home who can make them lunch, nor can all families exclusively afford one OR the other.  The point of this article is to support this effort, whether you allow your kids to buy lunch once or twice a week or you come up with some other way to make a positive impact.  All kids should have access to food at school, and it should be healthy.  They shouldn't be shamed for not bringing lunch from home, or getting reduced lunch, or whatever.  Do what you can to support more equitable options for kids--buying a better school lunch seems like a relatively small step that will make a big impact.",

Yes, there's a \"hot lunch\" option that is a deal, but nearly no one gets it. They all order a la carte, and a school lunch can easily  cost between $7-10 a day. And while the options have gotten somewhat more healthy, you can still do a much better job at home, at a far less cost.

The children are served at tables and taught table manners. There is no nonsense tolerated; no food fights, and the children sit still for the most part.  A wide range of foods are introduced, and children are encouraged to try everything.  Families pay what they can afford.

It did not consider the economics - the limited budget within which school menus planners must work - nor the fact that this is as much a marketing plan for America's food producers as anything else.\n\nIn places which put the cost on a sliding scale, there's a shame factor. In places which have parents recharge a card, the logistics of the card are an issue, so is \"shaming\" if a parent is delinquent. If the cost is made common for all, that eliminates the shame issue, and is a better solution for poor communities where the poverty rate exceeds 70%.\n\nBut, the meals are still not that great, nor are they necessarily prepared that well. That varies from school to school. And yes, the tastes kids want in order to eat the meals, rather than dump them in the trash, tend toward lots off salt, fat and sugar. And those kids who dump the meals may go hungry and/or or spend on other equally unnutritious and expensive snacks.\n\nI suggest that people watch Michael Moore's film, \"Where to Invade Next\", and watch the section where he goes to a public French school, nothing exceptional and has lunch with the kids. If they can serve food that good there, why can't we? I suggest that we certainly can, we just don't want to.",

Why not give the kids the option of whole milk or water? \n\nI still have my kids buying lunch about once a week--I'm not terrified of chocolate milk, but creating a habit of it could have quantifiable negative effects.",

Whatever extras were for sale, he'd buy--extra milk, juice, ice cream... to be fair, he is on the spectrum and additionally suffers from mental illness, and another child who is more able to respect boundaries and follow rules with the school lunch account may be just as well off with school lunch.",

The pics are from Austin, Texas which is a relatively progressive area of the US so the lunches might be healthier due to societal, parental, etc. pressure whereas lunches in a less progressive or poorer area are likely still not that healthy. Especially in light of further cuts via Trump. \n\nb. Are parents packing lunches mostly in wealthier areas? Because even if it saves money, poorer families may not have time to shop/ pack for lunch daily.So it might be a moot point depending on the area.\n\nc. I wondered if a parallel could be drawn to healthcare. When everyone participates in a national healthcare system, there are efficiencies and purchasing powers that occur which don't work as well when some opt in and others opt out.  I do like the idea of parents having a choice of what to send their kids to school with but on the other hand, maybe  national school lunch programs across the world are as strong as they are because practically all students participate (albeit they're usually healthier/ better tasting/ cheaper). \n\nd. It's sad we can't get out act together in the US. Recently, I learned  India feeds ALL its children a free lunch everyday. The US is wealthier than India yet we can't achieve this goal.",

We had a protein source, rotating among roast beef, baked chicken, roast pork, a dish called \"tamale pie,\" and baked fish (Friday).  There were always two servings of vegetables.  Salads and soups were available, along with delicious deserts (pies, cakes, puddings).  Hot dinner rolls made in the cafeteria kitchen came with the meal.  Ice cream, in small rectangular bars was also available.  In fact, for 7 cents (2 for the hot roll, 5 for the ice cream), the best ice cream sandwich on earth was often fashioned by the kids.\n\nThe above lunch cost was 40 cents, plus 5 cents each for soup or salad if chosen.  This was in the late fifties, early sixties.  I think elementary schools had smaller portions and a lower price.\n\nSome kids did take lunches from home.  But the school food was excellent, and one could smell it all over the school as it cooked.\n\nEven so, my senior year the kids revolted, and refused to buy lunches.  The main complaint was that soft drinks were not offered, but people complained about the quality of the food in general.  Mainly, they just wanted to complain.  For three days, only a handful of lunches were sold.  Then one day, our principal, who was well respected, went to a table of senior boys at lunch, and spoke to them frankly about student leadership.  They bought lunches, and the \"boycott\" was over.  Soft drinks were not added to the menu.  Overweight kids were rare.",

We were really unimpressed with what these guidelines permit.  Most of the snacks served were very high in simple carbohydrates and sugar.  After being in the classroom at snack time a few times, I was also really bothered that the calorie counts of snacks seemed to be all over the place.  One day they were served 4 Nilla wafers and 4 cucumber pieces for snack, this is about 30 calories--what active 3 year old can actually make it from lunch at noon to dinner at 6pm with only this snack?  Other days they serve more substantial food, but the variability plus generally so-so nutritional content was troubling.  We decided to opt out of all school snacks except fresh fruit/veggies and send in our own.  This way I know he's consistently getting a reasonable amount of food every day, and he has the option of eating some more satiating protein and healthy fats at each snack.",

Too often ignoring or downplaying the concept of intrinsic power is a big reason why.\n\nOnce everyone becomes dependent on the local convenience something like Facebook, the transit system or school lunches, those institutions are extremely likely to eventually leverage their monopoly. Stores keep prices low because people can move around and shop somewhere else. The cafeteria will only stay good as long as it competes with students bringing their own food (or sneaking out to go to Subway every day and getting suspended for it, but I digress). If everyone hangs a sign on their door that says, \"please exploit me\", odds are someone will take them up on it.\n\nThis does not mean we can never rely on the bus or the cafeteria, but if almost everyone became dependent on them, their quality and/or cost will at some point be nearly certain to deteriorate. One can gamble that today's quality will last or improve until the kids graduate, or one can exercise agency over something as fundamental as food and spend the effort on it. \n\nWhat else is more worthy of someone's time than having a certainty that children are eating quality food?",

Also, if low-income kids are hungry, they'll get no sympathy. That's what they get for being born without a trust fund. Losers! (smh)\n\nSecond, IMO, one reason kids eat better in other countries is not only because lunches are better but because they're exposed to good food at home. Ever glance in a shopping cart at the supermarket? If little Suzy and Billy survive on chicken nuggets and the occasional leaf of iceberg lettuce drowning in ranch dressing at home, of course they won't eat vegetables at school.\n\nLastly, to be fair to the kids that are exposed to healthy eating at home, mass producing tasty nutritious foods is hard and under the best of circumstances; I doubt that most schools can do it well, particularly on the budgets they have to work with. Yes, these lunches may look better, but the bar was so ridiculously low before that this isn't difficult. I'm a pretty healthy eater and I can spot a number of things that turn me off in these pictures. Of course a picky 10-year-old is going to dump a lot of it in the trash.  \n\nI don't know the answer, but lunches weren't that great when I was a kid; now they're even worse.

We had what I guess would not be considered heath food, goulash, hot dogs Mac and cheese pasta and meat ball etc. but very few kids were over weight and nobody died from the food.  Plus we had an hour for lunch and you could go home to eat. The kids that stayed got a half hour of recess. It was a working class town but people could afford the lunches. \n\nMy daughter works at a school, again in a working class area but two parents work and about 75% of the kids get free breakfast and lunch.\n\nI see Trump wants to increase defense spending and cut safety net programs, nice priorities.

We stopped buying them for our kids because they were given 20 minutes for lunch in elementary school, at least 10 of which were spent waiting in line. By the time they got lunch and found a place to sit, they had perhaps five or six minutes to eat. Additionally, if the kids were not able to eat every bit of their food in this tiny amount of time, they got in trouble with the lunchroom staff and were made to skip after-lunch recess and moved to a table where they would be watched and criticized until they finished. Despite discussions with the head of food services, the principal, and the district we made no progress in this ridiculous situation. Our kids are healthy eaters, not picky, and eat an appropriate amount of food for their level of hunger. The fact that the lunchroom staff would insist on each child taking a certain amount of food despite their appetite, and insist on them eating it all very quickly, was an extremely unhealthy thing to teach kids. Opting out of this negative situation by bringing lunch was a much better situation. We have never gone back to school lunch.",

As many have commented, not all schools are equally serviced and the health-factor of many is suspect.\n\nWhile the services make it easy for staff to serve large groups of kids at the same time as they offer vast choices, they are often processed, and are especially high in sodium. Our family has a genetic issue that makes these levels of sodium detrimental, so I packed every day for my kids until the very end of twelfth grade. \n\nWhat if instead of schools having every choice under the sun, they actually prepared healthy, home cooked meals, on site, and gave only two choices?",

My son packs his own lunch because he has autism and one of the many challenges he deals with is sensory food aversion, which means that the range of things he will eat is very small. (I think he may be the only child in North America who does not like and will not eat either pizza or chocolate.) My choices as a parent are to make sure he packs a lunch that he will eat, or pray that the school has SOMETHING that he will eat. Not only that, packing his own lunch every day gives him practice in the daily tasks of being organized and caring for his own needs, which if he is to ultimately live independently with his disability, are valuable lessons. Please let's not presume that every kid carrying a lunchbox is the product of affluent helicopter parents who overprotect their kids from real life. Some of us do have carefully thought out reasons for why our kids are bringing their lunch.",

Lunch therefore becomes another chance for teaching, and for community-building. Kids with actual special needs (not just \"I don't like green stuff,\" actual food allergies or religious requirements) either bring their own food or have something special prepared for them, but otherwise, you eat what's given to you. Because students control the distribution, you can often ask not to get something you don't like, though usually you can't trade what you didn't want for something you want more of. FWIW, there is very little wood waste in the system - when kids are raised to see the process as normal, they actually tend to eat what's prepared for them without much resistance.  \n\nThe comments to this piece show why that would never work in America, however:  we simply aren't communally minded in this country any more. You'd have tons of outraged parents ranting about how their kids don't like X, Y, or Z, or ranting that their overweight children don't get big enough portions, and then you'd also have the problem of time:  this process takes about an hour, time American schools don't seem willing to allocate to lunch. \n\nIn short, we get the country we deserve, because nobody cares enough to do any better.",

As a post WW2 student in an austerity driven UK, our school lunches were miserable (think of the shortages in the terrible winter of 1947). However, everyone was expected to eat the school supplied food as this extended the rations provided to each family. At lunch time, we sat at long tables supervised by prefects (think Harry Potter) and learned basic manners. The food was horrible but the community spirit was wonderful and the older students were expected to look after the little ones.\nI now substitute in my local affluent school district and have been impressed by the food supplied and the behavior. If the children don\u2019t want something, they place it on a cart for other children to eat. By the end of lunch, everything has gone. Little to no food seems to be thrown away.\nI agree that lunch breaks are too short. Easy solution: why not extend the school day by 30 minutes. My UK grandsons don\u2019t finish school till at least 4 whereas I am home by 3.",

Mind you, this is coming from someone that was born and raised Italian eating a awesome Mediterranean diet. I also think airplane food is good. But the school lunches around here are just not good. I\u2019ll continue to make lunch for my sons that include fresh food and even a Nutella sandwich. Anything is better than the processed food they serve.",

A large school means long lines waiting to be served. For many students, that can mean 15 minutes in a queue and five minutes to eat. This rushes the meal, obviously, which has costs in terms of social time with friends, basic manners, and, of course, the opportunity to eat at a healthy, reasonable pace. A lunch prepared at home affords some time to enjoy one's food and relax, however briefly, in the middle of the school day.\nSo, like much else, it's complicated.",

After trying them with our new lunch program, he brings Mac & Cheese in a thermos on days when Mac & Cheese is served, because the food served at the cafeteria is so awful, he won't eat it.

While they meet the nutritional guidelines of the federal lunch program, the food is not necessarily appetizing and often my students groan when the menu is read in the morning.  One of the big problems with food waste is simple...many of the fruits offered are too difficult for the students to eat.  One morning I noticed a young girl about to throw away a whole orange.  When I asked her about it, she said she was unable to peel it.  The tips of her fingernails did not extend above her finger tips.  Whole apples and bananas have also found their way into the trash can either because they were too difficult to eat or were simply not appetizing to children.\n\nPortions for all students were fairly standardized with smaller and younger students receiving the same portions as some of the older and larger students.

Some of our schools were also very open to experimenting with new and unusual healthy foods for children to try before putting them on the menu. I remember food service staff trying out frog legs for students, which was not implemented but it gave students an opportunity to try a new type of food.\nAs Secretary of Education working with food service directors, I proposed free lunches for all students as a way of increasing participation and ending the free lunch/reduced lunch stigma some students experienced. Unfortunately, we were not successful in making all lunches free but we were able to qualify for free lunches for anyone who was eligible for a reduced lunch.  I am an advocate for free breakfast and lunch for all children as a way of Increasing participation of school lunches which will improve the quality of food for all children.\nThere are many reasons parents may choose to pack lunches for their children, but quality of the lunches should not be the driving issue.",

In rural Colorado, there are school districts that can't afford to be open 5 days a week.  Somehow I doubt that they have wonderful, healthy school lunches to serve with fresh food or that the kids should be spending money on school lunches when lunch from home is cheaper.  \n\nPerhaps focusing on nutrition education (by someone with a college degree in nutrition) for everyone should be the goal, starting in elementary school.  As someone who had a career and degrees in nutrition and physiology, I am astonished at how little people know about nutrition.  Even less now in the information age than 20 years ago. People swing from one extreme diet to another.  The NYT even recently had an article about a 90% fat weight loss diet and quoted nutrition researchers.  How can that possibly be healthy in the long term, even if people temporarily lose weight?  Article like that don't  teach people how to eat a good balanced diet or keep the weight off or exercise and even give the impression that it is a healthy diet.  We do know what makes a good diet and people aren't doing it, even if they think they are eating healthy.\n\nSo instead of encouraging people to have their children buy school lunch so the school cafeteria can get more money, maybe the focus should be on nutrition education so people know what to pack for school lunch and  are eating healthier at home too.",

The consequences of a tiered-school lunch system is that those who can afford to pack lunch do so, leaving those without time and resources dependent on subpar food. In many ways, the problem with school lunch as described by Gaddis mirrors that of healthcare. Without universal coverage, those who can afford private care (whether out of pocket or through work) do so, leaving those without dependent on medicaid and, incidentally, at the mercy of politicians who scapegoat the poor to slash budgets. Universal lunch as with universal healthcare is one route to renewing civil society.\n\nAnd yet, I pack lunches for my kids. Why? Because of the plastic waste in school lunches. Why serve food in plastic or cardboard bowls on top of disposable trays when I can put unpackaged food into a reusable metal box?

Perhaps it is because they eat the same sort of food at home their mothers (and fathers!) pack for school. \n\nAs a substitute teacher in a solidly middle class community in Fairfield County, CT, my observation is that cafeteria lunches are heavy in fats and carbohydrates, with piles of pasta and servings of pizza even too large for an adult. Green stuff is minimal. And these \"entrees\" are complemented with chocolate milk, sweetened juice drinks and cups of processed fruit.\n\nYes, fresh fruit is available, but much of it is discarded. \n\nSo perhaps what the children are served needs to be changed to provide more protein, more roughage and less low cost, belly filling fats and carbohydrates.\n\nOne way to improve what children eat is to teach parents to avoid the center of the supermarket and shop the perimeter for fresh food -- vegetables, fruits, meat, fish and dairy.\n\nUntil children are offered nutritionally balanced meals, I applaud the parents who choose healthier lunches than what the US government sees fit to offer.\n\nAt the same time I a sorry for children whose meals are free or reduced cost because school meals may be all -- or most of -- what these often food insecure children receive.",

Other kids take their tray loaded with healthy food and toss everything but the bagel.  The cheese pizza is still the favorite.  I'm secretly cheering on the kids that ate the fruit and salad.   We have to keep trying to do better.  Giving kids the options and education to make better choices.  I'm fortunate that I can afford the healthy food at home.  Not all kids have parents that can.  The choices and options of all children matter to everyone.  These are our children's peers, their friends, and will become the community we all share.",

The lunches served at my daughter's elementary school however, look nothing like those in the photos presented here.  They are also heavy on meat, which she doesn't eat.  The PB&J sandwiches are prepackaged (wrapped in plastic) with a sort of bread that one of my daughter's classmates told me she wouldn't eat, and she is not the only one.  The lunchroom is also wildly understaffed, with two women doing an incredible job, with the help of parent volunteers when they are there.  Let's face it, everything about public education in this country is undervalued: the teachers and staff, the food, the maintenance of the buildings.  \n\nIt's been my NY public school experience so far that everyone (including parents) is working hard and doing their best against formidable odds.  I personally would love to save the time spent making lunch four out of five days a week, but better options would need to be provided for me to make that decision.",

I was literally on my way to becoming obese thanks to school lunch alone (to address other factors-my parents consistently prepared healthy homemade meals for every other meal, mostly vegetarian). My pediatrician gathered my fat and said I \u201cneeded to stop eating so many cakes and sweets\u201d (my parents never brought home or made cakes and sweets). I hit 9th grade, asked my parents to let me pack my own lunches, joined 3 athletic teams, became track captain, swim team captain, lost all the weight and never touched \u201ccookie Friday\u201d again. If anything, the pre-diabetic coma these school lunches were heading me towards  totally backfired and I took so much control back (simply because they were literally plumping us up with fat and hormones like livestock\u2014 almost all the kids were fat in that middle school) that I will not even touch anything I don\u2019t prepare myself. Thanks school lunches! You made me so fat, I swung back like a pendulum to nearly having an eating disorder from restricting! Pack. Lunch.",

To switch to cardboard trays was another 2 cents per tray, which added up to about $30,000 a year for my school. I was told it\u2019s just not possible given the limited budget.",

You had three different meal plans to choose from at varying price points. Assistance for lower income students and medical exemptions of course. Thus, we had a very healthy and robust school food program.\n\nI still got sick of the cafeteria food eventually. The dining hall inevitably became the meal option of last resort.\n\nThe same thing was true in grade school. Whether homemade or school bought, there was a standard menu rotation that simply becomes unappealing over time. The problem is so much worse as a child though because you have so much less control over your food decisions. I never told my parents about the meals I gave or traded away.\n\nOne other consideration, never underestimate a parent's capacity for nostalgia. Particularly among young children bagged lunches become a sort of love language. You're preparing a (supposedly) beloved meal as compensation for the time you can't spend with the child. The ritual gets emotionally entangled. Outsourcing the task feels cold and utilitarian even when the decision makes perfect sense.\n\nBesides, how else can you introduce children to the meals your parents made? I fully plan to torture any progeny with the canned roast beef sandwiches my parents would make. Builds character. For the record, I haven't eaten canned roast beef since grade school.",

Their lackluster organization hurt Biden, which everyone saw reflected in the Iowa results.\n\nI work at an old strip mall.

He knew what he was doing, and it showed.\n\nThis area has multiple meat-packing plants, and a diverse population of 169,405 people \u2014 organization, boots on the ground, and a handshake count here.

States grouped in each primary would include roughly the same number of votes needed for the nomination, thus no single date would be more \"super\" than any other. All would be somewhat regional to save on time, travel and fuel costs and to enable candidates and voters to benefit from the same media. Each must include states with a significant proportion of black and Hispanic voters as well as some rural and urban areas. Thus every candidate would be required to develop and hone messages that appeal to voters across the country and not purely regional, or even one-state, messages. The sequence should be adjusted so that a state like New Hampshire can be in the first group (and thus not have to amend its state Constitution) but the first grouping should include at least several of the states that are \"battleground\" states in every election including some of the following: Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida. The DNC would tweak this from election to election to adjust for changing demographics and voting patterns. However, I believe this approach would be most likely to give minority candidates an equal footing going into the first round and staying on their feet for subsequent rounds, and ensure that candidates who advance are those who appeal to the broadest range of primary and general  election voters.",

Congress can set minimum standards, e.g. the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

That is where dates are set and issues such as extended voting days and mail voting are determined.  The state BOE  \nmanages the process of selecting equipment, training and paying poll workers, arranging for polling places, and then the process of tabulating the results.  Some of this may be delegated to county or more local BOEs.\n\nWe can and should push at the state level for better voting laws.

What sort of blackmail are they holding over the parties to retain this right? Why not have Wyoming and Montana or North Dakota be the first? Just joking, but they have as much \"right\" to going first as Iowa and NH. \n\nI'd expand on your suggestion and break the country up into maybe four groups, each one with a mix of geographic and demographic electorates, and all using an open primary system. On this last point, I would suggest that people be allowed to register for the party holding the primary on that day, BUT...to prevent \"sabotage\" by Republicans or Democrats voting in each other's primaries to skew the results, if you register to vote in the primary under a party, you must maintain that membership until after the upcoming election. This wouldn't prevent anyone from voting for whomever they want in the general election, but it might make people think twice before giving up their party membership for the purpose of disrupting the other party's primary.\n\nWhatever is done though has to be done before the next cycle of primaries.",

The delay in releasing full and reliable caucus results was only a media crisis, nothing more. All the cable news channels had panels of political experts waiting breathlessly to analyze the import of the results as well as correspondents in the campaign headquarters of the candidates waiting to gauge their immediate semi-spontaneous reactions. The Times and other major newspapers had made similar commitments of time and resources. \n\nAnd then suddenly -- there is nothing to report!  All the panelists reduced to sitting around looking at the clock, making small talk and complaining about the wait. Reporters on the scene gulping coffee and trying to stay warm. TV viewers drifting off to a late night movie or to bed. \n\nA big media event that flopped. An industry disappointment, to be sure. But not a national crisis.",

In rural America. \nI have no problem with removing the caucuses, but make sure it is understood that it's not the state that's the problem. It's been the Democratic Party's ineptitude.",

The first 2 states from each group drawn in the lottery would do a Feb. primary, the second 2 would do it in March, etc.\n\nAlso, let's just get rid of caucuses, move to universal voter registration and a national standard for secure voting procedures, limit campaign spending and have calmer debates with more actual examination of the candidates' proposals and experience, but fewer gotcha moments and overly rehearsed sound bites.\n\nOh, and let's just ditch the backward and undemocratic Electoral College while we're at it.\n\nThis new way to choose presidential candidates would get everyone involved early by giving all states a gambler's chance to go first, and it would guarantee a mix of large and small, rural and urban, diverse and less diverse. It might also make the whole affair less pressured and rancorous. \n\nAlso by having the lottery only 3 or 4 months before the first batch of primaries, we could limit campaigning to the year just before the election. \n\nThis way our leaders might be able to dedicate more quality time to solving the world's problems.",

Once both parties have chosen a candidate, let them campaign and debate for no more than a month or two before the election.\n\nThat gives voters plenty of time to inform themselves (those who care to, that is) and choose their candidates.

It ranks right up there with the electoral college which brought us the worst president in modern history if not our nation's entire one.  So, first on the list is to begin eliminating caucuses throughout.  With that let there be only primaries; and as Charles states, let them start out in states which are not only larger but also more diverse.  Iowans are great people, and this is not about them personally.  It is just that it is a pretty Republican state, and our Democratic candidates there are like the proverbial fish out of water.  Charles comment about Kamala Harris's \"if only\" she could have started out in Nevada, our neighbor to the east or South Carolina.  I still am saddened by my senator's need to drop out from the race.  As a final thought, too, somehow, someway, and someday, the electoral college must go.

Until Democrats figure out it's the flyover territory in this country that determines elections, they are destined to lose.",

            "comment_body": "The Iowa Caucus last week demonstrated everything that is wrong with Democratic electoral politics. \n\nAs Mr. Blow notes, the state is overwhelmingly white. There are no large urban centers in Iowa. The population is older. Iowa is hardly representative of all Democratic voters. \n\nThen we have the debacle itself. No result totals for three days, and we've now come to learn that the Iowa Democratic Party is certifying results that still include mathematical mistakes. \n\nIowa has an outsize influence on our election results, and thus it has an equally important responsibility to \"get it right.\" Their voters have an incredible electoral advantage over the rest of us, because their votes give disproportionate weight to a candidate who may have little national appeal, but will be, nonetheless crowned \"the winner\" should he win the Iowa Caucus. And perception is everything in politics.\n\nThat the Democratic Party in Iowa, with such a small number of voters, could not complete a simple mathematical process reflects terribly on not only Iowa, but the rest of the us. \n\nAnd this disaster of a primary process has given Trump an argument to deny legitimacy of the November election, as he may cry \"rigged\" should he lose. \n\nIowa Democrats, sadly, have hurt the rest of us at a time when we least needed it. And the problems they've created were all self-inflicted. None of this needed to happen. \n\nIowa should never again be permitted to go first in the primary season. \n\nAnd Mr. Blow",
