            "full_text": " The Truth About Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Walker Whether he \nneeds assistance or not, the image can influence jurors and reinforce harmful \nstereotypes of people with disabilities. By Jasmine E. Harris Ms. Harris is a \nprofessor at the law school at the University of California-Davis. Harvey \nWeinstein\u2019s walker is playing a featured role at his trial. The decrepit-looking\n Mr. Weinstein, body hunched as he slowly rolls forward, contrasts sharply with \nhis former image as a domineering Hollywood power broker now accused of rape and\n predatory sexual assault. Whether Mr. Weinstein needs a walker or the \nassistance of aides to help him in court because of recent back surgery, as his \nlawyers claim, is beyond the point. Seeing him lean on the walker or appear to \nstruggle without it does more than just capture attention. The image creates \nimpressions and can reinforce prejudices. To the judge, jurors, lawyers, \nreporters and onlookers the walker conveys an image, accurate or not, of \nphysical weakness and dependence \u2014 what I call the \u201cthe aesthetics of \ndisability.\u201d These physical and behavioral markers of disability produce \nvisceral responses in jurors and the public that can lead them to be more (or \nless) sympathetic when weighing a defendant\u2019s liability, public responsibility \nand, in the end, punishment. Disability aesthetics play a critical role in jury \ndeliberations because, unlike race, gender, socioeconomic status or sexuality, \npeople believe disability is fundamentally different and warrants differential \ntreatment. Jurors swear an oath to decide the facts given to them based on the \nevidence presented. They also rely on their \u201ccommon base of knowledge and \nexperience,\u201d as one court put it, to judge the credibility and persuasiveness of\n witness testimony. But their common base of knowledge and experience about \ndisability is at best incomplete or inaccurate, and so, by default, jurors will \nrely on a flawed set of beliefs when they see victims and defendants who appear \nin someway disabled. While wheelchairs, walkers and other mobility devices are \noften associated with dependence, many people use them to achieve greater \nfreedom of movement and overall independence. Studies have shown that when \njurors perceive a victim in a sexual assault case as a person with a disability,\n they are more likely to believe the victim and punish the defendant. Other \nresearch suggests a defendant\u2019s intellectual or developmental disability might \nlead jurors to discount liability. Similarly, research indicates that jurors are\n likely to be more lenient in assigning liability and punishment when a \ndefendant is or appears to be 50 or older. In this sense, both age and \ndisability status neutralize or offset juror and public perceptions of danger \nand risk. Like the Weinstein trial, other high-profile cases have raised similar\n issues about the aesthetics of disability. Paul Manafort, the former Trump \ncampaign chairman, and Robert Gregory Bowers, charged in the Pittsburgh \nsynagogue shooting, each appeared in court in wheelchairs. So did Joseph James \nDeAngelo, the so-called Golden State Killer, who also seemed to struggle to \nspeak above a whisper \u2014 an image that was wholly inconsistent with the man \nneighbors described as boisterous and \u201cfit.\u201d So why should we care about what, \nin some cases, is a strategic use of this aesthetic in court? Criminal trials \nare performances, after all, with high stakes and lawyers squaring off in an \nadversarial system where their duties are to zealously represent their clients. \nWe should care because the aesthetics of disability can be used to manipulate \nthe legal system while also reinforcing stereotypes of what people with \ndisabilities look and sound like, and what they are capable of doing. For people\n with obvious disabilities, societal expectations remain limited, as explicit \nand implicit biases may affect hiring decisions; access to quality education; \ndecisions about sexual intimacy, marriage, and parenting without court \ninterference; voting and jury service; and even immigration status. Scholars \nhave studied the \u201cspread effect\u201d \u2014 how one visible impairment gets transferred \nto all aspects of a person\u2019s ability. It is why wheelchair users are sometimes \npresumed to be cognitively impaired even though the ability to walk has \nabsolutely nothing to do with mental capacity. These biases also affect people \nwhose disabilities may be less visible or obvious and whose claims to disability\n are questioned because they do not match existing stereotypes. This can deny \nthem access to legally mandated reasonable accommodations, critical health care \nand social supports necessary for meaningful integration in employment, for \nexample. In the end, Mr. Weinstein may very well be in a state of deteriorating \nhealth. Or the truth might be that he, like many others before him, will hope \nthe benefit of disability aesthetics will help him in the courtroom. But the \naggregate effect of this litigation strategy has ripple effects we have not yet \nwrestled with or connected to broader anti-discrimination efforts.

            "full_text": " Coronavirus Spreads, and the World Pays for China\u2019s \nDictatorship Xi used his tight rule to control information rather than to stop \nan epidemic. By Nicholas Kristof Opinion Columnist China\u2019s leaders sometimes \nseem 10 feet tall, presiding over a political and economic juggernaut that has \nfounded universities at a rate of one a week and that recently used more cement \nin three years than the United States did in the entire 20th century. President \nTrump has hailed China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, as a \u201cbrilliant leader,\u201d and \nMichael Bloomberg says Xi is \u201cnot a dictator.\u201d But we\u2019re now seeing the dangers \nof Xi\u2019s authoritarian model, for China and the world. The first known \ncoronavirus infection in the city of Wuhan presented symptoms beginning on Dec. \n1, and by late December there was alarm in Wuhan\u2019s medical circles. That would \nhave been the moment for the authorities to act decisively. And act decisively \nthey did \u2014 not against the virus, but against whistle-blowers who were trying to\n call attention to the public health threat. A doctor who told a WeChat group \nabout the virus was disciplined by the Communist Party and forced to admit \nwrongdoing. The police reported giving \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201ccriticism\u201d to eight \nfront-line doctors for \u201crumormongering\u201d about the epidemic; instead of punishing\n these doctors, Xi should have listened to them. China informed the World Health\n Organization of the virus on Dec. 31 but kept its own citizens in the dark; as \nother countries reported infections even as China pretended that it had confined\n the outbreak to Wuhan, Chinese joked grimly about a \u201cpatriotic\u201d virus that only\n struck foreigners. Wuhan\u2019s mayor said he wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the virus\n until late this month. In that time, people traveled to and from Wuhan and \ndidn\u2019t take precautions. The government finally ordered a lockdown on Jan. 23 \nthat effectively quarantined people in Wuhan. But by then, according to the \nmayor, five million people had already fled the city. Partly because the \ngovernment covered up the epidemic in the early stages, hospitals were not able \nto gather supplies, and there are now major shortages of testing kits, masks and\n protective gear. Some doctors were reduced to making goggles out of plastic \nfolders. One reason for the early cover-up is that Xi\u2019s China has systematically\n gutted institutions like journalism, social media, nongovernmental \norganizations, the legal profession and others that might provide \naccountability. These institutions were never very robust in China, but on and \noff they were tolerated until Xi came along. I conducted a series of experiments\n on Chinese blogs over the years beginning in 2003 and was sometimes surprised \nby what I could get away with \u2014 but no longer. Xi has dragged China backward in \nterms of civil society, crushing almost every wisp of freedom and oversight. For\n the same reason that Xi\u2019s increasingly authoritarian China bungled the \ncoronavirus outbreak, it also mishandled a swine fever virus that since 2018 has\n devastated China\u2019s hog industry and killed almost one-quarter of the world\u2019s \npigs. Dictators often make poor decisions because they don\u2019t get accurate \ninformation: When you squelch independent voices you end up getting just \nflattery and optimism from those around you. Senior Chinese officials have told \nme that they are routinely lied to on trips to meet local officials and must \ndispatch their drivers and secretaries to assess the truth and gauge the real \nmood. For this or other reasons, Xi has made a series of mistakes. He mishandled\n and inflamed the political crisis in Hong Kong, he inadvertently assured the \nre-election of his nemesis as president of Taiwan, and he has presided over \nworsening relations with the United States and many other countries. The \ncoronavirus has already reached the Xinjiang region in the Far West of China, \nand one risk is that it will spread in the internment camps where China is \nconfining about one million Muslims with poor sanitation and limited health \ncare. Viruses are challenges for any country, and it\u2019s only fair to note that \nChina does a better job protecting its people from measles than the U.S. does. \nIt\u2019s a credit to China\u2019s system that a baby born in Beijing today has a longer \nlife expectancy than a baby born in Washington, D.C. More broadly, the United \nStates, which has several impoverished counties with lower life expectancy than \nCambodia or Bangladesh, is in no position to lecture anyone about health. But, \nwith a dose of humility, let\u2019s get over any misplaced admiration some Americans \nhave for Xi\u2019s authoritarian model. The Chinese social contract has been that \ncitizens will not get ballots but will live steadily better lives, yet China\u2019s \neconomy is now as weak as it has been in three decades \u2014 and the coronavirus \nwill sap growth further. Xi is not living up to his end of the bargain, and this\n is seen in the anger emerging on Chinese social media despite the best efforts \nof censors. I don\u2019t know if Xi is in political trouble for his misrule, but he \nshould be. He\u2019s a preening dictator, and with this outbreak some citizens are \npaying a price. ",

By Elizabeth Drew Ms. Drew is a journalist based in \nWashington who covered Watergate. If there are to be witnesses in the \nimpeachment trial of President Trump \u2014 at this moment an unknown \u2014 John Bolton \nand Hunter Biden would almost certainly be among those called to testify. Some \npeople on Capitol Hill describe it as a one-for-one trade. This idea has been \nwidely dismissed by both sides. Democrats say Hunter Biden, son of former Vice \nPresident Joe Biden, is irrelevant to the issues in the articles of impeachment.\n The president and Republicans assert that Mr. Bolton, the former national \nsecurity adviser who was fired by Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Bolton says he quit \u2014 is \nsimply promoting a forthcoming book and has nothing meaningful to say. To my own\n surprise, I now think that such an arrangement might well be highly valuable \u2014 \nfor the country. For some time, I was against the Democrats\u2019 offering any Biden \nas a witness in Mr. Trump\u2019s trial, on principle. Just because the Republicans \nwant to batter Hunter Biden is no reason to submit either him or his father as \nfodder to hostile Republicans. But principle can be turned on its head; calling \nHunter Biden could backfire on the Republicans big time. In a television \ninterview last October Joe Biden\u2019s sole surviving and troubled son came across \nas a straightforward, unassuming guy: He conceded that he most likely wouldn\u2019t \nhave been asked to join the lucrative board of one of Ukraine\u2019s largest natural \ngas companies, Burisma, or been offered other opportunities, but for his last \nname. A multitude of investigations of his arrangement with Burisma have turned \nup no wrongdoing on Hunter\u2019s part \u2014 other than inviting the appearance of a \nconflict of interest, since at the time his father was in charge of Ukraine \npolicy for Barack Obama. Having him appear as a witness could expose the fatuity\n of the Republicans\u2019 efforts to smear him and his father. In fact, a number of \nRepublicans actually don\u2019t want to call the younger Biden. They\u2019re worried about\n the circus atmosphere that might present \u2014 and they\u2019d rather have the issue \nlinger as a useful weapon. Acceding to Hunter as a witness would call the \nRepublicans\u2019 bluff. Having Joe Biden\u2019s son testify would illuminate the Bidens\u2019 \nirrelevance to the issue of whether the president held up congressionally \nappropriated military assistance for Ukraine until the Ukrainian president \nannounced \u2014 not necessarily conducted, just announced \u2014 a government \ninvestigation into the Bidens\u2019 role. An appearance by Hunter before Senate \nquestioners now could also go some distance toward removing him as an issue in \nthe general election, should his father be the Democratic nominee. In fact, \nHunter could be the star witness as to why a president\u2019s (or vice president\u2019s) \noffspring should stay out of any business that might have something to do with \ntheir parents\u2019 job. Moreover Joe Biden is at his most moving when he talks about\n his family and what it has been through: The Republicans could be handing him a\n lovely opportunity to make a knockout campaign speech. And several advantages \nwould accrue to the Democrats if Mr. Bolton were to testify. First, this would \nundermine the White House\u2019s and Republicans\u2019 plan to terminate the trial with a \nvote to acquit Mr. Trump by the end of this week. Second, Mr. Bolton could smash\n the White House\u2019s and Republicans\u2019 argument that there is no direct evidence \nthat Mr. Trump himself directly linked military aid to Ukraine to a request that\n the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, announce an investigation of the \nBidens. (Mr. Bolton reportedly said as much in an unpublished manuscript of his \nforthcoming book, causing the White House to threaten to block its publication.)\n Third, the longer the trial drags on the greater opportunity there is for more \ndamaging information to arrive on the Democrats\u2019 doorstep. Even if gathering the\n two-thirds Senate vote to remove Trump from office remains beyond reach, a \nsecondary goal of the Democrats is to make Trump\u2019s acquittal as unglorious as \npossible. The more an acquittal hinges on preposterous limits on disclosure of \ninformation and on preventing witness testimony, the less valid it will seem. As\n in the case of the Mueller report, this won\u2019t stop Mr. Trump from declaring a \nfabulous victory. But the Democrats, with the Republicans in control of the \nSenate and so far essentially united on not convicting the president and \nremoving him from office, have to go with what they can get. Democrats publicly \nbrush off suggestions of a Biden-for-Bolton witness swap, but that could be a \nnegotiating position. It\u2019s odd that after three years of a Trump administration,\n Republicans didn\u2019t foresee the danger in putting their political careers in the\n hands of a man who\u2019s out solely for himself and has a very distant relationship\n with the truth. But they clearly felt that they had no choice, and thus they \nenabled Mr. Trump to take them out on his limb. They are so frightened of him \nand his base that they have accepted his demand that his bullying phone call \nwith Mr. Zelensky be considered \u201cperfect.\u201d This has left them, as well as him, \nno wiggle room. Which makes a Bolton appearance all the more dangerous. Also, \nhaving Mr. Bolton testify offers him and his newfound Democratic allies an \nopportunity to make other damaging disclosures that may not yet have been \ndiscovered in his book or may not lie therein. He can elaborate on another bit \nof damaging goods from his book that has already been revealed: that in Bolton\u2019s\n view (he\u2019s not alone in this) Mr. Trump has seemed particularly complaisant \ntoward autocrats. Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence\n Committee and lead prosecutor in the impeachment trial, had planned to \ninvestigate whether Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy has been guided by his business \ninvestments. Mr. Bolton may know if this occurred. Mr. Trump\u2019s company, from \nwhich he hasn\u2019t divested his interest, has property in at least two countries \nled by autocrats with whom he\u2019s on especially friendly terms: Turkey and the \nPhilippines. Mr. Bolton has written that he worried about Mr. Trump\u2019s particular\n warmth toward the leaders of China and Turkey. Might Mr. Trump\u2019s subdued \nreaction to demonstrations in Hong Kong and to Turkey\u2019s decision to invade \nnorthern Syria have anything to do with Trump company business? Mr. Bolton may \nalso know about other conversations with foreign leaders locked in the \nsupersecret computer system where the full conversation between Mr. Trump and \nMr. Zelensky was consigned. We\u2019ve only seen a scrubbed transcript of that \nconversation. Why? And are there other conversations with foreign leaders \nrevealing blunders or abuses of power by Mr. Trump stored there as well? John \nBolton might have answers. Democrats should strike a deal, even an implicit one,\n to get him on the witness stand.

            "full_text": " Every Time Palestinians Say \u2018No,\u2019 They Lose Things \nrarely go well for those who try to live history backward. By Bret Stephens \nOpinion Columnist Regarding President Trump\u2019s peace plan for the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict, the instant conventional wisdom is that it\u2019s a \ngeopolitical nonstarter, a gift to Benjamin Netanyahu and an electoral ploy by \nthe president to win Jewish votes in Florida rather than Palestinian hearts in \nRamallah. It may be all of those things. But nobody will benefit less from a \ncurt dismissal of the plan than the Palestinians themselves, whose leaders are \nagain letting history pass them by. The record of Arab-Israeli peace efforts can\n be summed up succinctly: Nearly every time the Arab side said no, it wound up \nwith less. That was true after it rejected the 1947 U.N. Partition Plan, which \nwould have created a Palestinian state on a much larger footprint than the one \nthat was left after Israel\u2019s war of independence. It was true in 1967, after \nJordan refused Israel\u2019s entreaties not to attack, which resulted in the end of \nJordanian rule in the West Bank. It was true in 2000, when Syria rejected an \nIsraeli offer to return the Golan Heights, which ultimately led to U.S. \nrecognition of Israeli sovereignty of that territory. It was true later the same\n year, after Yasir Arafat refused Israel\u2019s offer of a Palestinian state with a \ncapital in East Jerusalem, which led to two decades of terrorism, Palestinian \ncivil war, the collapse of the Israeli peace camp and the situation we have now.\n It\u2019s in that pattern that the blunt rejection by Palestinian leaders of the \nTrump plan \u2014 the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, denounced it as a \n\u201cconspiracy deal\u201d \u2014 should be seen. Refusal today will almost inevitably lead to\n getting less tomorrow. That isn\u2019t to say that the plan, as it now stands, can \ncome as anything but a disappointment to most Palestinians. It allows Israel to \nannex its West Bank settlements and the long Jordan Valley. It concedes full \nIsraeli sovereignty over an undivided Jerusalem. It conditions eventual \nPalestinian statehood on full demilitarization of a Palestinian state and the \ndisarming of Hamas. It compensates Palestinians for lost territories in the West\n Bank with remote territories near the Egyptian border. The map of a future \nPalestine looks less like an ordinary state than it does the M.R.I. of a lung or\n kidney. Then again, much of what the plan gives to Israel, Israel already has \nand will never relinquish \u2014 which explains why the plan was hailed not only by \nNetanyahu but also by his centrist rival Benny Gantz. Critics of Israeli policy \noften insist that a Palestinian state is necessary to preserve Israel as a \nJewish democracy. True enough. But in that case, those critics should respect \nthe painful conclusions Israelis have drawn about just what kind of Palestinian \nstate they can safely accept. More important, however, is what the plan offers \nordinary Palestinians \u2014 and what it demands of their leaders. What it offers is \na sovereign state, mostly contiguous territory, the return of prisoners, a link \nto connect Gaza and the West Bank, and $50 billion in economic assistance. What \nit demands is an end to anti-Jewish bigotry in school curriculums, the \nrestoration of legitimate political authority in Gaza and the dismantling of \nterrorist militias. Taken together, this would be a historic achievement, not \nthe \u201cscam\u201d that liberal critics of the deal claim. The purpose of a Palestinian \nstate ought to be to deliver dramatically better prospects for the Palestinian \npeople, not tokens of self-importance for their kleptocratic and repressive \nleaders. That begins with improving the quality of Palestinian governance, first\n of all by replacing leaders whose principal interests lie in perpetuating their\n misrule. If Abbas \u2014 now in the 16th year of his elected four-year term of \noffice \u2014 really had Palestinian interests at heart, he would step down. So would\n Hamas\u2019s cruel and cynical leaders in Gaza. That the peace plan insists on the \nlatter isn\u2019t an obstacle to Palestinian statehood. It\u2019s a prerequisite for it. \nAt the same time, it\u2019s also essential to temper Palestinian expectations. The \nJewish state has thrived in part because, dayenu, it has always been prepared to\n make do with less. The Palestinian tragedy has been the direct result of taking\n the opposite approach: of insisting on the maximum rather than working toward \nthe plausible. Things rarely go well for those who try to live history backward.\n For all the talk about Trump\u2019s plan being dead on arrival, it says something \nthat it has been met with an open mind by some Arab states, including Saudi \nArabia and the United Arab Emirates. They know only too well that the Arab world\n has more important challenges to deal with than Palestinian statehood. They \nknow, too, that decades of relentless hostility toward the Jewish state have \nbeen a stupendous mistake. The best thing the Arab world could do for itself is \nlearn from Israel, not demonize it. That ought to go for the Palestinians as \nwell. The old clich\u00e9 about Palestinians never missing an opportunity to miss an \nopportunity has, sadly, more than a bit of truth in it. Nobody ought to condemn \nthem to make the same mistake again.

            "full_text": " No, Team Trump, the Coronavirus Isn\u2019t Good for \nAmerica The commerce secretary just flunked microbe economics. By Paul Krugman \nOpinion Columnist How frightened should you be about the coronavirus? I\u2019m no \nepidemiologist, but what I\u2019ve seen looks pretty scary. It doesn\u2019t help that the \nTrump administration, as part of its general war against science and expertise, \nhas seriously reduced America\u2019s capacity to respond if we do face a dangerous \npandemic. It also looks quite possible that the virus will inflict a lot of \neconomic damage \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t kill you, it might kill your job. And one \nspecial source of concern is that top officials in the Trump administration are \ntalking nonsense about the economic threat. So, about that economic threat: Many\n people are drawing parallels between the coronavirus and the 2002-3 outbreak of\n severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which also originated in China. \nLike the current outbreak, SARS led to the imposition of economically disruptive\n quarantines, which appear to have had a significant if temporary adverse effect\n on China\u2019s economy, and a modest negative impact on the world economy as a \nwhole. We still don\u2019t know whether the coronavirus is more or less dangerous \nthan SARS. What we do know is that the global economic implications of a \npandemic in China are likely to be much more severe now than they were then, for\n the simple reason that China is a vastly bigger player than it used to be. In \n2002 China was still in the early stages of its great economic surge; it \naccounted for only around 8 percent of global manufacturing value added, far \nless than the shares of the U.S., Japan and Europe. Today, however, China is the\n workshop of the world, accounting for more than a quarter of global \nmanufacturing. Now, you might think that this implies an upside to China\u2019s \ntroubles, that disrupting China\u2019s vast manufacturing sector would offer \nopportunities to producers in other countries, including the United States. That\n is, you might think this if you knew nothing about 21st-century economics. Sure\n enough, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, appeared on Fox Business on \nThursday morning to declare that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to talk about a victory lap,\u201d \nbut that the coronavirus \u201cwill help to accelerate the return of jobs to North \nAmerica.\u201d By saying this, he demonstrated a couple of things: (1) why Gail \nCollins\u2019s readers voted him Trump\u2019s worst cabinet member, and (2) why Trump\u2019s \ntrade war has been such a failure. What Ross and his colleagues apparently still\n don\u2019t understand \u2014 although some of them may be getting an inkling \u2014 is that \nmodern manufacturing isn\u2019t like manufacturing a couple of generations ago, when \ndifferent countries\u2019 industrial sectors were engaged in fairly straightforward \nhead-to-head competition. These days we live in a world of global value chains, \nin which much of what any given nation imports consists not of consumer goods \nbut of \u201cintermediate\u201d goods that it uses as part of its own production process. \nIn such a world, anything that disrupts imports \u2014 whether it\u2019s tariffs or a \nvirus \u2014 raises production costs, and as a result if anything hurts \nmanufacturing. Indeed, a recent study by the Federal Reserve found that Trump\u2019s \ntariffs, which were concentrated on intermediate goods, have reduced, not \nincreased, manufacturing output and employment. Sure enough, while overall \neconomic growth in 2019 was decent (not great), manufacturing is in a recession.\n (And the uncertainty created by the trade war may explain why business \ninvestment is down despite a huge cut in corporate taxes.) As I said, some of \nTrump\u2019s people seem to have gotten an inkling here. Last week the White House \nbasically admitted that tariffs on steel and aluminum have done more harm than \ngood, hurting industries that use these materials. But the administration\u2019s \nanswer isn\u2019t a reconsideration of its policies \u2014 it is to impose more tariffs, \non a wider range of products. Which brings me back to the coronavirus. Let\u2019s \nleave aside the public health issues \u2014 although the Trump administration has \nclearly left us much less prepared than we had been to deal with these issues if\n they become serious \u2014 and focus on the economics. What we can say is that if \nthe virus seriously disrupts Chinese production, its impact on the U.S. economy \nwill be like an extreme version of Trump\u2019s trade war, except without any \ncompensation in the form of tariff revenue. And the two things we know about the\n trade war are that it has been an economic bust and that Trump\u2019s officials \nstill appear clueless about why it has been a bust. Bear in mind that so far \nTrump has been remarkably lucky. Aside from Hurricane Maria \u2014 which he \nmishandled, and in which thousands of Americans died \u2014 he has faced essentially \nno crises, domestic or foreign, that weren\u2019t of his own making. And he has \nsurrounded himself with the gang that couldn\u2019t think straight, which raises \nsevere doubts about how well he would handle a crisis that he didn\u2019t create \nhimself. If Wilbur Ross\u2019s boneheaded remarks on Thursday are any indication \u2014 \nand I fear they are \u2014 the Trump administration is even less prepared to deal \nwith the economic fallout from a possible pandemic than it is to deal with the \npublic health crisis. Be afraid. ",

            "full_text": " The Future of American Politics After tribal war, the\n politics of weaving. By David Brooks Opinion Columnist Men and women are \nprimarily motivated by self-interest. No other partial truth has done as much \ndamage as this one. If you base your political and social systems on the idea \nthat the autonomous self-interested individual is the basic unit of society, \nthen you will wind up with an individualistic culture that widens the \nmaneuvering room between people but shreds the relationships and community \nbetween people. You will wind up with a capitalism in which superstar performers\n get concentrated in superstar cities and everybody else gets left behind. In a \nsystem based purely on competitive individual self-interest, those who are \nadvantaged get to race out further ahead year by year. The sense of common \ncommunity and equal dignity is annihilated. This is the flaw of unrestrained \nliberalism, what the radicals call \u201cneoliberalism\u201d or \u201clate capitalism.\u201d And \nthey are not entirely wrong. Populists on the right and the left look at this \ncurrent reality and they come to a swift conclusion: The game is rigged! \nLiberalism is a con! Then they come to a different conclusion. The essential \nlogic of society is not actually individuals seeking their self-interest. It\u2019s \ngroups struggling for power. Society is an arena where certain groups crush \nother groups. On the Trumpian right it\u2019s the coastal cultural elite trying to \ncrush and delegitimize the white Christian patriots of the heartland. On the \ncultural left it\u2019s the whole Michel Foucault legacy. Language is a tool the \noppressor class uses to permanently marginalize the oppressed. On the economic \nleft it\u2019s the Bernie Sanders class war. The greedy capitalist class rigs the \nsystem and immiserates the working class. The populist narratives differ but all\n have the same underlying structure. We\u2019re locked in a life-or-death struggle of\n oppressor vs. oppressed groups. It\u2019s Us versus Them \u2014 the good people here and \nthe bad people there. The problems in society didn\u2019t just happen; they were \nconsciously engineered by The Evil Other, who must be broken. Our very existence\n is at stake! If the anthropology of unrestrained liberalism is the autonomous \nindividual making his own way, the anthropology of populism is warrior ants in a\n ruthless tribal war. These are very different views of human nature, but they \nhave something in common: Both narratives make us miserable! In one, life is \nisolation, inequality and the feeling of being invisible. In the other, it\u2019s \nmalice, fear and constant war. And that\u2019s because both of these political \ntendencies are wrong about human nature. They create societies that pulverize \nwho we are and are made to be. Human beings didn\u2019t evolve into the world\u2019s \ndominant species because we are more autonomous. We didn\u2019t do it because we\u2019re \nmore vicious in tooth and claw. We thrived as a species because we are better at\n cooperation. We evolved complex social networks in our brains to make us better\n at bonding, teaching and collaborating. We don\u2019t cooperate only to get things \nwe want individually. Often, we collaborate to build shared environments we can \nenjoy together. Often, we pick a challenge just so we can have the joy of \ncollaborating. Relationships are ends to themselves. Thus, the best future for \nAmerican politics is not based on individual competition or group war. It\u2019s \nbased on this narrative: We are an incredibly diverse society that got good at \ncollaboration because we had to. The best future politics puts collaborative \npluralism, weaving, at the center. That means, first, electing leaders who are \nmasters at cooperation. No offense, but if you\u2019re supporting Donald Trump or \nBernie Sanders this year, collaboration skills are not high on your list of \npriorities. Second, it means infusing cooperative weaver values into all of our \norganizations. There\u2019s a fantastic community organization in Baltimore called \nThread that has a few core competencies that shape its culture. We\u2019d be in much \nbetter shape if every organization in America lived out these values: Show all \nthe way up. Be fully present, honest and vulnerable in all interactions. \nRecognize your own value. Push through discomfort to connect deeply with others.\n Learn from all voices. Most of our challenges are complex. It takes every \nperspective to see an issue whole. Assume people have the best of intentions, \nand actively focus on the value they bring. Be intentional about being with \nthose different from you. Treat relationships as wealth. Human bonds are the \nchief resource of your organization. Recognize the inherent value of each person\n and meet each person where she or he is. Fail forward. Life is iterative. Your \nvision is not always the answer, but rather a step in a creative learning \nprocess. Set up feedback mechanisms that support change and personal growth. \nDogma won\u2019t get you to the solution. Openness and adjustment will. The third \ntask of weaver politics is reforming institutions so they encourage \ncollaboration. Some of our institutions, like Congress, have been completely \nsubsumed by tribal warfare. Other institutions, as Yuval Levin writes in his \nbook \u201cA Time to Build,\u201d are no longer formative places where we learn and serve;\n they have become platforms individuals use to broadcast their supreme selves. \nStill other institutions have become dehumanized. Our schools, hospitals, \nprisons and welfare systems don\u2019t embed people in thick relationships. They \ntreat them as units to be processed and shoved out the door. Still other \ninstitutions cease to exist. Why do we still not have a national service \nprogram? America has an enormous task of institutional reform ahead of it, just \nas it did in the Progressive era. The fourth and final task of this kind of \npolitics is transformative policies that directly address our most serious \ndivides. For example, reparations are a way to acknowledge the wrongs inflicted \non African-Americans and to begin to heal that breach. Congressman Ro Khanna has\n a proposal that would show rural America that everyone has a place in the new \neconomy. He would fund research and technology hubs throughout the country \u2014 a \nland grant college system for the 21st century. The politics of weaving grows \nout of the acknowledgment that there is no dominant majority in America. There \nis no moderate center. Your group will never pulverize and eliminate your \nopposing group. There\u2019s no choice but to set up better collaborative systems \nacross difference. This is not a problem, it\u2019s an adventure. Yes, human beings \nare partly selfish and self-interested. But we are also supremely social and \ncollaborative. This is the part we have to work on now. ",

            "full_text": " The Supreme Court\u2019s Collapsing Center on Religion A \ncase over vouchers threatens to breach the wall separating church and state. By \nLinda Greenhouse Contributing Opinion Writer Every Supreme Court case tells a \nstory. Both sides vie to persuade the justices \u2014 and, in big cases, the public \nas well \u2014 to see the issues through one particular narrative lens. Heading into \nlast week\u2019s argument on whether Montana was obliged by the federal Constitution \nto keep subsidizing religious-school tuition under a scholarship program that \nviolated the state Constitution, it was easy to see which story line was \nwinning. \u201cSchool Choice Battle May Boost Religious Freedom\u201d was the headline on \nUSA Today\u2019s preview of the argument. That is indeed the narrative put forward by\n lawyers for the school-choice movement, which seeks to use this case to break \nthrough the barriers that in many states have prevented parents from using \nschool tuition vouchers for parochial school tuition. The libertarian Institute \nfor Justice, long a leading proponent of vouchers, is framing its appeal, \nEspinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, as a case about religious freedom. \n(It\u2019s worth noting that this is not a religion case brought by the religious \nright; conservative religious groups, along with the Trump administration, are \nriding the Institute for Justice\u2019s libertarian coattails in a symbiosis of \nconvenience.) The state, defending its high court\u2019s decision to shut down the \nscholarship program for all private schools, secular and religious, has no \ncorrespondingly snappy one-liner to offer. It argues that religious freedom is \nenhanced rather than threatened by preventing the flow of public money to \nreligious institutions. That argument gained no traction last week with a \nSupreme Court majority determined to lower the constitutional barrier between \nchurch and state. That this odd case is a glaringly defective vehicle for \nreaching that goal only shows the depth of the majority\u2019s determination. The \ncase is also a perfect vehicle for showing something else: the contradiction at \nthe heart of the religious claims being pressed on increasingly receptive \nfederal courts. Those making these claims say that religion and nonreligion must\n be treated equally. \u201cThe rule is religious neutrality,\u201d Richard D. Komer, a \nsenior attorney with the Institute for Justice, told the justices. So if parents\n are able use publicly financed scholarships for secular private school tuition,\n this argument goes, there should be no difference when it comes to religious \nschool tuition. When pressed, however, as they are in this case, religion \nadvocates seek something more than equal treatment. It turns out that what they \nwant is special treatment. That\u2019s this case. The plaintiffs are claiming a \ncontinued entitlement to scholarships for their parochial school tuition despite\n the fact that the state court ended the scholarship program for religious and \nsecular schools alike. No one gets the money. It\u2019s not enough that all parents \nare being treated the same, no matter where they choose to enroll their \nchildren. It\u2019s different from the invitingly simple \u201creligious freedom\u201d story \nline, more complex, with deep implications for how Americans will live in an \nincreasingly diverse society. Montana\u2019s Constitution, which the voters ratified \nin 1972, carried forward the principle of no aid to religious schools that was \npart of the state\u2019s original 1889 Constitution. The current Article X prohibits \nusing state money \u201cfor any sectarian purpose or to aid any church, school, \nacademy, seminary, college, university, or other literary or scientific \ninstitution, controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or \ndenomination.\u201d The one exception was something new in the state\u2019s Constitution: \nan exception for money from federal grants \u201cprovided to the state for the \nexpress purpose of distribution to nonpublic education,\u201d which may pass through \nthe state\u2019s hands and into the coffers of religious schools. This exception won \nthe Montana Catholic Conference\u2019s support for the new Constitution. A brief \nfiled by a majority of the surviving constitutional convention delegates cites \nthe Catholic support to refute the allegation \u2014 offered forcefully in the briefs\n and during the argument \u2014 that the no-aid clause reflects anti-Catholic \nbigotry. In 2015, following a model used in other states, the Montana \nLegislature established a tax credit of up to $150 for taxpayers who donated to \na \u201cstudent scholarship organization.\u201d That organization in turn would use the \npooled money to offer need-based scholarships to parents for use at any private \nschool. As in most states, the majority of Montana\u2019s private schools are \nreligious; in Montana, all the religious schools are Christian. (No non-\nChristian religion claims more than 1 percent of Montana\u2019s population.) Thirteen\n schools participated in the program, of which 12 were religious; the single \nsecular school serves children with disabilities. Parents who were using the \nscholarships at religious schools sued in state court after the state\u2019s \nDepartment of Revenue issued a rule requiring the program to conform to the \nConstitution\u2019s no-aid clause. The Montana Supreme Court, declaring itself bound \nby the clause, invalidated the entire tax-credit program; there are no more \nscholarships for use at any private school, religious or secular. \u201cAnd the \nconsequence of this decision is that there is no discrimination,\u201d Justice Elena \nKagan told Mr. Komer. \u201cNeither set of parents is getting what they want,\u201d she \nwent on. \u201cNow, you might say, well, both should get what they want, and maybe \nthat would be a better world. Maybe. But the constitutional harm that it seems \nthat you have to allege here is the discrimination. And there is no \ndiscrimination.\u201d Exactly. When the clock ran out on Mr. Komer, the \nadministration\u2019s principal deputy solicitor general, Jeffrey Wall, picked up the\n plaintiffs\u2019 argument. It was a question, Mr. Wall said, of the religious school\n parents\u2019 constitutional right to free exercise of religion. \u201cTheir free \nexercise is being penalized,\u201d he said. There is so much about this case that is \nsimply backward. The administration argues in its brief that \u201cthe constitutional\n violation in this case is especially egregious because it involves the \neducation of children.\u201d But to the contrary, that\u2019s exactly where the wall of \nseparation has to be maintained with the greatest care. Religious education \nserves a purpose, inculcating religious values and preserving religious \ntraditions. A parochial school is not just another neighborhood school down the \nblock. Certainly, parents are constitutionally entitled to choose a religious \neducation for their children. And under a 2002 Supreme Court decision, Zelman v.\n Simmons-Harris, states are free to offer parents the choice of using vouchers \nto help pay for religious education. That was a bitterly fought 5-to-4 decision.\n The administration now would go further: not only that a state may include \nreligious schools in a voucher program, but that it must include them, if it \nwants to have a voucher program at all. And where is the stopping point of that \nargument? Justice Stephen Breyer pressed that question on Deputy Solicitor \nGeneral Wall. Cities and states support public schools, Justice Breyer observed,\n asking: \u201cIf I decide for you, am I saying that they have to give money \u2014 same \namounts, proportionate \u2014 to the parochial school?\u201d Mr. Wall deflected the \nquestion, instead pointing to the court\u2019s decision three years ago that a state \nprogram in Missouri to enhance playground safety couldn\u2019t exclude the \nplaygrounds of church-run schools. \u201cThe court said you can\u2019t deny a generally \navailable public benefit to an entity that\u2019s otherwise qualified based solely on\n its religious character or nature,\u201d Mr. Wall said of that 2017 ruling. In fact,\n the court both did and didn\u2019t say that in the decision. Chief Justice John \nRoberts\u2019s opinion in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Comer contained a \nfootnote: \u201cThis case involves express discrimination based on religious identity\n with respect to playground resurfacing. We do not address religious uses of \nfunding or other forms of discrimination.\u201d \u201cThat rule applies equally to schools\n as to playgrounds,\u201d Mr. Wall nonetheless asserted. Does it? Will it? How can it\n not, now? The footnote in the Trinity Lutheran case was extremely odd. It \nprovoked an objection from Justice Neil Gorsuch that the Supreme Court rules on \ngeneral principles rather than specific facts, and that \u201cgeneral principles here\n do not permit discrimination against religious exercise \u2014 whether on the \nplayground or not.\u201d Chief Justice Roberts no doubt included the footnote as a \nnecessary play to the center to satisfy some member or members of a majority \nmore fragile than the eventual 7-to-2 vote made it appear. Justice Kagan? \nJustice Anthony Kennedy, whose seat is now filled by Justice Brett Kavanaugh? \nThe chief justice himself? \u201cThe center cannot hold,\u201d Yeats wrote in \u201cThe Second \nComing.\u201d He didn\u2019t have the United States Supreme Court in mind when he wrote \nthat line. That doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t fit. ",
