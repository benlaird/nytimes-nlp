On top of that typical  renters need two months  security. do the math. If the average one bedroom in Manhattan leases for  $4,000 per month,  that means you need $16,000 on signing before you can move into your 800 square foot basement apartment in SoHo. This is an outrage. Thus social injustice should have been cured long ago. The filthy rich ruling class who own the property should bear the burden of these costs. Owners are in a better position to negotiate with the spoiled predator broker class who are used to collecting these userous fees often times for turning a key handle and tendering a lease.  Thank you to all the democrat politicians who have made this change possible. The Republicans have favored the corporate brokers for ages.  The law is clearly constitutional and will be sustained upon review. Stay tuned.",

Forcing a renter to pay such an exorbitant fee for a service to the landlord, only made more costly and more difficult to rent. \nNow that the landlords are responsible for the fee, we will see how much it is worth really. If they manage to pass it 100%, so be it. That means it's necessary and that where the market is.\nBut I believe it will be significantly reduced because the landlords, unlike renters, do have bargaining power and now have the choice to pay or not that fee. \nAnother important consequence, which I do not see mentioned, is that now renters do not have to put up with endless rent raises or with landlords who do not take care of the properties. Moving is not as expensive, so renters can shop around and move for a cheaper or better apartment. I know many people stuck with apartments simply because they cannot afford to pay 2 months rent, deposit and first rent, before their previous landlord returns their security deposit. \nThis is a really positive development and after some turmoil the market will find its equilibrium.

While the landlord has the ability to competitively bid his/her property's listing, they can force brokers' fees to properly reflect the value-add brokers are providing.  And, landlords can also structure the fees as they so choose - perhaps extend them over the course of the year or over a few years during the tenancy.  \n\nBy pushing the fees on new tenants, the prior law removed free market dynamics.  Tenants paid whatever they were told to pay without any real ability to negotiate.  And so, if brokers fees do come down (as I suspect they will), it's because they were set inappropriately and unfairly relative to the actual value-added.   And, yes, rents will increase over time (for those not stabilized) so that landlords can recoup these costs.  That is exactly how it should work.",

They deter people from switching apartments even when they have outgrown a space, for example, after having children. These fees give landlords the upper hand in determining rent increases given the tremendous costs of relocation. These fees deter civil servants and other less prosperous people from staying in NYC.  All of this leads to millions of dollars taken out of the local economy each year.  It also contributes to the exodus from NYC, a city with one of the highest rates of departures.

From a tenant\u2019s perspective the broker may appear to be an unnecessary middleman, but the person they\u2019re serving is typically the landlord, who is relying on the broker to market and show the apartment. When a landlord is using a broker they are effectively bearing the cost since they either need to pay the broker themselves or accept a lower rent than what they could get if they listed it as a no fee apartment. Landlords can be more profitable by not using a broker, just like they can be more profitable by doing their own repairs and maintenance. But for many landlords the extra profit is not worth the cost of their time. I don\u2019t see how this regulation will significantly reduce the demand for brokers, or ultimately how it will save tenants money. It doesn\u2019t change the basic supply or demand for rentals, which is what sets the full price (rent and fees) for housing. If the government wants to save tenants money they need to do things that either increase the supply of rentals (e.g., higher density zoning) or decrease the demand for them (e.g., raising taxes on businesses causing jobs to leave the city).",

The apartments shown to me were handled by the on-site management office. The family-owned corporate landlord had a large administrative office in Manhattan, which is where I went for a vetting and an interview. And the lease I signed was executed in the landlord's management office, not at the broker's place of business.\n\nI am convinced the fee I paid was largely a kick-back to the landlord, but of course I could never prove it. The new law will curtail sleazy practices such as these and I'm all for it.",

Landlords, however, have the collective market power to negotiate with brokers, and that is what this writer is worried about. Once they are on the hook for brokers' fees for the services rendered only to them, they aren't just going to accept the take it or leave it standard of 15% of the first month's rent (and those who think they can just pass that on in the form of rent will be sorely mistaken when more entrepreneurial landlords start pushing back at the standard broker fee). Brokers will actually have to compete and prove that they add enough value to the transaction to earn that 15% standard now. \n\nAlso, even if brokers are successful at holding their ground and landlords just push the cost through increased rent, being able to amortize that over the term of the lease instead of paying it all at signing, will help many renters.",

How can your internet search compare to my 20 years of analyzing the apartment market and living in the same city?  Does your internet search tell you  which owners are best for long-term renters, which offer the lowest rate of increase, which are more flexible to pets, etc?  Its amazing how many people reduce apartment hunting to an internet search.   Guess what?  The internet is nothing compared to personal experience.  I have had countless people reject my advice and come back because they got burned because of a \"good deal\" they found on the internet.  Every year people try to not pay after they love the apartment.  Brokers are given no respect even though I treat my clients and landlords like gold.  If you had to deal with the thousands of difficult, often unscrupulous, demanding people we deal with you would realize there is no amount of compensation in the world that is enough for what brokers have to put up with.

Just like now, renters were finding listings in the Village Voice and only needed someone to unlock the apt for a showing, once -- hardly worth 15% of a year's rent. \n\nWhen I moved to Venice Beach, it was such a relief to find a wonderful place in the canals and only have to lay out first, last, and a deposit, after finding the listing through a real estate broker who was compensated directly by the landlord. \n\nI've also spent time building a career in a field (typesetting) that abruptly disappeared with the advent of desktop publishing, so I feel your family's pain, especially the very sudden nature of it. I hope you can both find jobs with decent compensation. But I hope those jobs don't involve gouging people who are already getting ripped off by housing costs.",

They work without pay for many hours, on \"spec,\" in hopes that they will eventually make a match between the potential renter and a landlord or between buyers and seller. If they do seal a deal, they have to give 50 percent - or more - of their fee to the listing broker firm. If they have shared a listing, they have to split their half of the fee with the OTHER broker from a different firm, leaving themselves with a quarter of the original fee. Only the very top brokers involved in the sales of expensive properties do well, and even that is sometimes an elaborate illusion, as portrayed in a recent NYT story.

And I'm not running into too many sensitive, artistic types when I go into a real estate office to ask a question. Take a look at my comment in the \"New York Today\" section from Friday. I've been treated abominably by several brokers I've used. Plus, whenever I walk into an office to ask about apts. in my range, they literally laugh at me and make insulting remarks. It's not as if I have some fantasy of a $900 apt. with a terrace. I know what rents generally are, but I do see some things in my range online. There's no reason to be insulting or low class. Everyone I know has horror stories. Perhaps your husband works for a higher-end brokerage or for himself and is not involved with such annoyances as renters who are looking for something under $3,000 a month. (The vermin!)\n\nI've been through the bait-and-switch. I've requested specifics, such as lots of light, only to show up to see caves. I've shown up supposedly for an appt. to view, when the broker actually had no appt. with the tenant and we couldn't get in. These are just a few of my stories. \n\nI recently asked two co-workers who rent near me if they could recommend their brokers. They both said no.\n\nIt's disingenuous to pretend there are just a few bad apples and you have no idea where this notion of shifty rental brokers comes from. Plead your case to them.

She knocked her price down to \"only\" 12%, so she got $2376 for meeting me and showing me two apartments. She wasn't working in my interest. She never disclosed that her boss was my landlord. When I saw the first apartment, which had a hole punched in one wall, I said that I didn't think these were really good listings, and she gave me a line about how I didn't know enough to understand what I was seeing. While she said that she'd help me find a roommate, she didn't return my calls after she got her fee. The apartment I moved into had been rented for $110 a month, and Croman was suing renters to get them out and renovate. She didn't disclose that, nor did she disclose that there would be construction for the next year in the building.",

There is no justification for a business model that exploits the needy and doesn't allow for options.\nThe fee is only eliminated for rent regulated apartments so the other half of the market is still there for the fleecing.

Yes, the broker does do a lot of work showing to many potential tenants, and this is why the landlord should pay, not the eventual renter.\n\nFurthermore, as a renter it's not like I can look at an apartment online and then \"shop around\" for a broker to then show me the place. Now with landlords paying the fee there will be actual competition among the brokers to provide the best service at the most reasonable price. That's an actual market: the people receiving the service can pick and choose who to do the job based on cost, recommendations and services provided. This how it works for other services landlords routinely purchase (repairs, maintenance, building porters). When tenants pay they fee, there is no market.\n\nI don't begrudge your husband, but the rental fee system has been distorted for a long time and it's time it became aligned with market ideals. I'm sure he'll do well marketing his competent services to landlords. He may need to innovate and compete, but that's also what a true market is supposed to push forward.",

I know this first hand because he was the broker showing my apartment to clients when we were moving from Brooklyn to be closer to family. \n\nWe shared our concerns with your husband about the landlord\u2019s neglect of major repair issues in the bathroom of the apartment, but didn\u2019t seem concerned about them and called them \u201ccosmetic\u201d. If he had taken an interest in hearing our experience with the landlord\u2019s failures in making lasting repairs, and of the landlord hiring sub-par contractors who did quick, cheap and shoddy work, he could have taken the opportunity to seek assurances that the issues would be fully addressed by the landlord for the next tenant and not risk letting the landlord slap up some paint to cover over the stagnant water stains and the mold growing through the seams of the sheet rock in the bathroom ceiling. \n\nI\u2019d certainly want to trust that a broker I work with is looking out for my experience as a renter over preserving their relationship with the landlord, especially if the tenant was going to be on the hook for the broker\u2019s commission. Unfortunately, your husband\u2019s behavior in our situation didn\u2019t do much to build my trust in the profession.",

President Obama saved the auto industry which is a big contributor to the jobs picture and to the health of the overall economy.\n\nIn addition, President Obama prevented a collapse of the financial markets, and he successfully turned what was nearly another Great Depression into a Great Recession.  Plus, it is NECESSARY to increase SHORT TERM government spending in such circumstances, but R's did not cooperate.  Since Trump's election, R's gave gratuitous, massive tax cuts to the wealthy (lying to the middle class) and have created the largest budget deficits and national debt in history.  \n\nLowering federal interest rates has cause irresponsible borrowing by businesses.  This guarantees a much more severe recession (or depression) when the next downturn comes.  And there's no where left for the feds to go with lowering interest rates.  \n\nUnder Trump, the economy is a mirage.  It's going to implode!",

The cost of housing, health care, child care and education have skyrocketed, and these costs are pushing more and more of our \u2018middle class\u2019 into the ranks of a permanent underclass of working poor. \n\nAt least 90% of us are vulnerable. When I went to law school at my state university in 1983, resident tuition was under $3000 a year. The federal minimum wage was $3.35 an hour. Today, the tuition is $30,000. The minimum wage is not $33.50 an hour. A few years after graduation, I bought a modest bungalow in Seattle for $72,000. That very same home is now \n$1 million. The cost of health care has outpaced the CPI for years. Child care costs more than a minimum wage worker earns.\n\nThis is not just happening in high flying metropolitan areas - it has reached small town America. Most of us have one foot on the banana peel.\n\nIn 2017 the wealthy received $1 trillion in tax relief - say goodbye to \u2018infrastructure\u2019 and other programs. Since 2017, the net worth of the 1% has increased by an estimated 29%. Wages up 2% annually.\n\nIrony of ironies: the most popular and brutally effective method of suicide among rural white males? Exercising their sacred Second Amendment right. Suicide by gun \u2018succeeds\u2019 about 90% of the time; all other suicide methods have about a 90% failure rate.

Their circumstances are totally without hope if our government doesn't respond.  No wonder the increase in deaths, that is there only way out.  Trump offered the simple persuasion, that 'he alone could fix it' and they bought into his con.  He never cared for anyone that couldn't add to his power and wealth.  Why should he now?  He has cheated his whole life and considers anyone suffering as 'suckers'.  He said, he 'loved low information voters' not because he cares about the oppressed, but because they are easily conned into voting for him.  Justice must be served.  The day of reckoning will come.  The blood of these victims is on this president and the Republicans in leadership, especially McConnell, whom gained a tax break for themselves and donors, while stalling on other bipartisan bills that would improve the lives of the masses, so these deaths don't continue.  To the Evangelical leaders, I ask, where is your compassion and love for those Jesus loved?  How can you speak of a God of love and be so heartless to those in need, to support such an administration?  Praying that God's word speaks to your hearts and minds and convicts and leads you to speak truth to power.  God is not mocked, you will reap what you sow.",

That is the practical ability to really change things. \n\nOne issue I would pick with you  is the idea that \"output is surging\". A closer look at economic data of the past decade shows the opposite. \n\nSince the Great Recession of 2008-09, economic growth has averaged barely half what it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Investment is down from those peaks too. Worryingly overall American purchases of automobiles are way down from their mid-1990 highs. \n\nWhy is this? Let me put you a hypothesis : Growth is down because inequality has reached such proportions that broad-based consumer demand has slackened substantially. In other words, impoverished people in their tens of millions do not continue to consume as they did in the past. \n\nThis is a silent but clear warning for American capitalism - and global capitalism generally : Absent major efforts to reverse rising inequality, capitalism will fail to generate sustainable returns. \n\nAs a capitalist, I believe we need to be more enlightened. We urgently need public good investment on a huge scale in education and training, infrastructure, clean energy, a stronger updated social safety net. Regionally this needs to reach into the poorer states of the USA in particular.  Without this, in another decade we will bellowing at even worse problems.",

What, specifically, can President Trump, or ANY President, do to improve the economy?  Bully the Fed into stomping on the gas pedal of low interest rates?  It's not that significant as it affects short-term borrowing from lenders, which most businesses never do and which simply loosens up the cash flow incrementally.   \n\nIf anyone asked me, a follower of twenty news sources, what President Trump has done to stimulate the economy and keep its ten year streak going, I wouldn't have an answer.  He's eased rules for heavy polluters and the fossil fuel industry, yes.  If you're a skeptic, there's not much President Trump has done for the general economy.  But there are some things he can do.   \n\nAs an example, I'd love to see a job skills initiative to promote vocational education for \"middle skills\" jobs - welding, CNC and other machining, auto repairs, HVAC, plumbing and electrical, etc.  It would help fix the huge problem we have in the USA of finding good people to fill jobs.   Maybe add a low-cost government competitor to private health insurance so small business could afford to hire more people.  Free trade would also be helpful.\n\nShow me why we should vote for a candidate, and I will do it, but for now I don't see how most Presidents, including the current one, have earned the right to be applauded for the economy.",

When I graduated high school in 73 there were so many jobs in railroad, phone company, defense work(in Conn, auto work in Mich) that many considered it dumb to go to college as you could make 15-20k right out of high school. I had not connection to get these jobs so  I took engineering and got a job at 12k in 78 but did not catch up to these other guys until about 1990 or so.  However with deregulation, outsourcing, automation many of these high paying jobs disappeared in the 90s and I saw many bitter guys(mostly) who had lost the ability to learn and were making too much to go backwards.  So many divorces, foreclosures, etc and their kids were not able to cope.  Rosanne type TV shows glorified anti intellectualism and made people pursing knowledge into \"nerds\".  We can't make this happen again as it was an offshoot of our victory in WW2 but so many guys are hopeful for the \"good old days\" and look to Trump for validation.  The last guy who \"could\" have done this was Perot but that was 30 yrs ago and that toothpaste is long out of the tube",

Historically, Idaho has been a low wage state -- and those of us who have lived here for a long time have not earned enough to keep up with the significant rise in the cost of living. Boise is now the 50th most expensive place to live in the U.S.\n\nAdd to that, the influx of people and investors from out-of-state who have driven the cost of housing sky high. For older people such as myself and young couples, it's impossible to buy a home at Idaho wage levels. Long-time homeowners are suddenly facing property taxes that are so high (thanks to an overheated real estate market driven by those out-of-staters) that many are being forced to sell with nowhere to go. Rents are just as crazy. Landlords are raising rents every six months or so \"to keep up with the market\" or \"because my property taxes are so high.\"\n\nAnd if you are over 50, forget finding meaningful employment -- even with a college degree or two. The age discrimination is blatant and out-of-control. And I'm still feeling the financial effects of the Recession.\n\nThe myth of a \"great economy\" is just that -- a myth. The job numbers can be manipulated to show whatever results you want. The reality is bleak for those of us who struggle with getting by day to day.

Democrats can \"fine tune\" their messages and run the \"ideal\" candidate, but they will never win the support of Trump voters because to do so would require embracing bigotry.

Yet, the media still worked overtime to get him re-elected.  So let me get this straight...the Times loves a photogenic personable President which had no real accomplishments, left the military in a state of near unpreparedness, and had no economic solutions other than almost robbing our future by borrowing from China; and then hates a less personable President who has a great deal of economic accomplishments and has restored moral within the military.     The heart of this article decries the fact that those with low education levels also have low income and are faced with mental and physical problems.  Does it really take a Dartmouth economist to figure out that if a person makes a decision not to pursue an educational program that leads to a decent job then that person might just have problems in life?  I assume then that the writer favors patting a person on the back and saying \"That's ok...you don't have to take responsibility for your life...we'll just over- tax those who do work to give you want you want anyway.\"  I'm all for active compassion, but not for reckless entitlement.",

Every day millions of workers are exposed to dangerous working conditions, and in many situations, it is a direct result of ignoring OSHA's existing health and safety standards.  OSHA has inadequate resources to address this problem and as we might guess, also (currently) has a weak mandate to enforce these regulations.  The decline of unions, who have over the course of history championed safer work conditions, has also contributed to this \"pain epidemic\".  Part of the solution to the problems experienced by the working class lie in creating safer working conditions, a very relevant point that needs more attention!",

Then the media is obligated to give people the facts: the world cannot sustain Trump or his GOP cult or his ilk around the globe without the price being the possible end of civilization as we know it. As for the millions of jobs Trump is claiming his economic policies are creating, I suspect those will mainly be digging graves and cremating the dead if he has another four years of help from the media in telling lies.",

Every year about 16,000 Americans commit suicide with a gun. The vast majority are men. Gun suicides are roughly half of all annual gun fatalities. Official records indicate that another 30,000 Americans commit suicide in some other way. Who knows how many other Americans kill themselves slowly with alcohol or drugs? Every year about 65,000 Americans die due to an opiate overdose. These staggering numbers will only get worse the longer this administration remains in the White House. Trump and his frightened Congressional Republicans are going after health care and a score of vital working class government programs. Both Trump and McConnell have said publicly that they are planning to attack Social Security and Medicare in his second term.",

The other question referenced seemed so vague as to be useless. Ask oneself what are the incentives at play in answering these questions?\n\nTrump causes people to be agitated by his corruption and incompetence, but this does not mean he created the declining relative wealth of the average working class white male. Reduced levels of discrimination and international competition did that, paired with advances in logistics and a disparity of environmental and safety enforcement around the world. Whether this decreased their absolute wealth is a more difficult and more important question to answer.\n\nWorking class people have always known some people are vastly wealthier than they are. Going to work in a factory reminds someone every day that there is a factory owner and a plant manager.

This is what that \u201chumanity first\u201d message is all about - and why I support him.\n\nSo here we have a guy who has been offering a centrist path forward, pulling in despairing working class voters from across the spectrum, offering ideas to help the very population that elected Trump and who has had their needs neglected since, and the party is either ignoring them, or prescribing solutions because we assume we know better. And he is polling so low he is probably dropping out soon. Which is a shame because people are hurting out there and as Americans they deserve more. And he is right to point out that it will get worse as jobs get automated. Sure, new jobs will come, eventually. But they will be located in cities and not in the areas where they were lost.\n\nAnd in the meantime, one more more climate denying Trump term is disastrous - and will just make the lives of the people described in this article worse off. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\n\n(Ps - Trump did finally tweet about Yang - just to point out that the Dems don\u2019t care about the needs of the people because if they did they would be listening to Andrew.)",

The stock market is doing well because of two things, first the corporate tax cuts. Lowering taxes ALWAYS brings a larger bottom line to the companies that avoid them...er pay them. Democrats have never denied this. But it's the lowest hanging fruit. And there are costs to picking it. \n\nThe second thing has been done under Trump's guidance is the getting rid of any restraints on business to do what they want in the pursuit of profits.  Democrats don't deny that removing regulations, mostly designed for the good of most of America, the future, the planet, the flora, the fauna, will cut into corporate bottom lines. But they result in benefits that aren't quantifiable in terms of money. They are about a better future for more Americans.\nA GOP \"yes\" vote is an absolute given when it comes to tax cuts for the wealthy and gutting regulations. Democrats don't promote such things because they know that they are harmful to the masses and to the future. Not because they don't think they'll increase profits. \nI can see why a shortsighted selfish single person would vote for Trump and continued stock market gains. What I don't see is why anyone who is unselfish and/or has children with a longer time horizon then they, can vote for a guy who will gut the future in the pursuit of profits for profit's sake.",

I'm in manufacturing and anecdotally, I see manufacturing coming back -- mostly to Mexico true -- but it's coming back.  The new North American Trade Deal helps too -- and in this area there is some bi-partisan agreement.  On Energy, cutting regulations and opening lands for oil exploration, is more jobs.  With fracking, we are building a new energy infrastructure to support energy export.  Trump by cutting regulations and opening new lands, is spurring this development.  I'm in Pennsylvania and I see the effects of this transition every day.   Am I worried about the long term effects on the environment?  Resoundingly 'YES' -- but that wasn't the focus of the article.  \n\nLastly, Trump's increased defense spending is helping goose the economy.

Am I worried about the effect of this spending on the deficit?

No college degree, and 4+ children that started when they were in their early 20\u2019s. It\u2019s a conversation we never have as a country, that having children young, maybe some would say even too young is setting yourself up for a lifetime of financial struggles. We no longer have farms that require 7-8 offspring to ensure the labor force to keep the farm going. America needs to start educating it\u2019s populace of the financial responsibilities of having children, and what the average child will experience with no college graduate in the home. A $25k/year salary doesn\u2019t seem like enough, and of course it isn\u2019t when you\u2019ve got 3 kids as well, but two adults on $50k a year, no children is indeed sufficient. People need to understand this since as a country we are not willing to provide benefits for people in this situation.",

The lion share of his supporters rely on receiving health care through the ACA, especially for pre-existing conditions, but Trump & company are gutting the ACA every day. Not one of Trump's policies, whether it's tariffs that INCREASE costs across the board, tax cuts for billionaires that clearly must not have enough money, cutting Medicaid, and threatening cuts in both Medicare and Social Security, is going to help any of them. Every single Red State receives more federal money than they pay in, which goes for roads, infrastructure, and health care. Blue States pay in more and receive less. And every single day there's an announcement that some longstanding protection for our air, water, or environment has been overturned by this administration. Trump supporters in Red States have their heads in the sand, preferring fantasy over reality, and all of our children will pay for it.",

For years, I wondered why he, his colleagues, and his counterparts seemed to care so deeply about the suffering among immigrant communities in coastal cities or among people overseas, yet ignored the situation at home completely.  I wondered (and still do) if this is why more privileged people so often hold the poor in contempt if they think about them at all.\n\nThe generally contemptuous comments about Trump voters have hardly changed during Trump's time in office though and Democrats are largely supporting Buttigieg instead of Warren because they know he's a \"safe\" paid of hands (i.e., it will be business as usual, with the already-privileged retaining their huge unearned advantages where there are people who can't afford basics).  So that shows me that although the media has played its part, people know exactly what they're doing.\n\nI'm nearly 43 with a PhD in engineering, a work ethic that involves working seven days a week, a frugal lifestyle, and a job history that includes some of the best-known institutions in the world.  Without parental support, even someone like me can't afford a house or kids.  I had to wait until I spent a couple of years working in Switzerland to get painful ovarian cysts and dental issues taken care of or even identified.

It averages out to 40,000 a month and it is believed that when the period of March 2019 - March 2020 is reported there will be as big or more than likely a larger drop which means since job growth has not been that fantastic this year some months will drop below 100,000. Also never discussed is what kind of jobs and the pay. Also it seems as one economist reported and no one wants to in the main stream media including tv discuss is with the Baby Boomer like me retiring at close to 200,000 a month then how many jobs are really being created. It is a rigged fake game.

All of a sudden they were eager to \"do the right thing\".  How many other types of situations just like this do not come to the attention of someone like Mr. Kristof who can expose these titans of American businesses for what they often are - interested only in profits, their own compensation and keeping their shareholders happy.  Think of Wells Fargo who has repeatedly scammed and cheated customers.  No one went at the Corporate level to jail, and the low level employees who were pushed to sell products and essentially defraud customers did it because they were desperate to keep their jobs.  They were fired or laid off as a result of the scandal.  The head of Wells Fargo walked away with his \"golden parachute\".  This is the divide that should be emphasized.   The people making 25-40K a year are barely getting by.  They often have minimal health care, with deductibles and co-pays that make the term \"insurance\" a joke.  They are treated like disposable non-entities as US Bank showed us.  Most people are hard working.  They do not necessarily envy the billionaires - they just want fair pay, reasonable benefits, and not worrying that a health emergency will send them into bankruptcy.",

We have the \"Wall St. Economy\" as I would call it, that is reported upon widely by the media, and hailed by the Establishment as booming. But then we have what I would call the \"Real Economy\", the one that is experienced by the majority of Americans, the middle and working class. \n\nIn the \"Real Economy\", measures like unemployment are almost meaningless, much as they would've been had they been used to measure the pre-Civil War economy in the South. The \"unemployment\" was almost zero then, but I wouldn't say the \"workers\" (slaves) were happy. And saying that wages have risen in the past three years ignores how they were stagnant or even went down for decades before. And how much of these \"gains\" are due to government -mandated increases in the minimum wage? Capitalism sure can't take credit for that!\n\nIn fact, the \"Wall St. Economy\" is so disconnected from the \"Real Economy\" that the experts can't grasp why major portions of America have still not experienced any recovery from the Great Recession. Their confirmation bias that is based upon the \"Wall St. Economy\" continues to blind them to reality. \n\nThis is why Bernie Sanders is defying all the pundits, much as Trump did in 2016.

Also, doesn't the end of the baby boom mean less workers in general so therefore less people for the same number of jobs which would also contribute to low unemployment?

And it isn't just the working class.  The middle class is struggling with a constantly increasing cost of living. \n\nEven though wages are rising now, costs are rising even more.  Housing costs are increasing, with more families spending half their income, or more, on a place to live.  Child care costs continue rising.  College educations are plunging millions of Americans into debt every year.  And health care premiums, copays and deductibles are also increasing rapidly, meaning that even those who have health insurance are struggling, or going without needed care.

This is what I call the real \"Trump Bump.\" Turnout for voters under age 50 surged. People under 50 might not match the turnout rates of 65+ in 2020, but they don't need to match it in order to make up a significant majority of votes cast. And remember, there are young people in every state. Median age doesn't vary much from state to state.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, Gen X favored Dems over Repubs by a 1.24 : 1 ratio. Millennials favored Dems by a 2.14 : 1 ratio. Not all of Gen Z can vote yet, but in 2020 they already account for 1-in-10 eligible voters.

Rather than helping the democrats unite behind a policy of \"healthcare for all\" he selfishly and narrow-mindedly focused on a divisive campaign \"medicare for all.\" This country needs a unifying candidate. I agree with Mr. Bruni that Sanders nomination increases the risk of another four years of Trump.

But above all, electoral votes, electoral votes, electoral votes. It literally is immaterial how many popular votes a candidate gets. Crazy as this is, it's where we are at. This is the current system.\n\nThat's why it is so important to stop talking about things that absolutely won't fly in those states, like reparations, decriminalizing illegal border crossings, and free healthcare for illegal immigrants. Because to keep talking about those issues in the swing states is political suicide. So is Medicare for all if the majority of Americans don't want it. Hello?\n\nThis refusal of Bernie to pay attention to what the voters want and what they adamantly do no not want is what worries me about him and gives me pause. And what does it mean to be a populist then, if the majority holds no sway?",

Here is Bruni's attempt:\n\"As for the argument that Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat proves the inefficacy of an establishment or center-left nominee, well, Clinton won the popular vote by about three million ballots and lost the Electoral College by only about 77,000, despite Russia, despite James Comey, despite a relentless focus on her emails and despite her own uniquely heavy political baggage. Subtract all of that and you get a winner \u2014 a winner who looks nothing like Bernie Sanders.\"\nOne can hear Steve Bannon laughing in the background while he reads such a complete validation of what he told Bill Maher \"This is what I love about you guys, you've got to whine about everything. You know what the rules are and you can't win\". Indeed a litany of excuses does not make an argument. Among the list of culprits, my favorite is Hillary's \"heavy political luggage\". Back then it was seen as such a liability that scared all establishment competitors to sit out that primary. \nAddressing such logical contortions with a minimum of intellectual honesty should suggest that identifying the most electable candidate is nothing but a fool's errand. When such a fool's errand is pursued by bashing the most popular candidate the only goal achieved is gifting more voters to Trump.",

Sure, doctors and Mennonites complained when Tommy Douglas proposed it decades ago...but they are all doing rather well now.  \n\nI would also add that I am sorry to note that Frank Bruni - whom I generally respect in the NYT and on CNN - is espousing a view of Bernie Sanders that sadly differs little from that of Bret Stephens.  \n\nComparing Trump and Bernie Sanders is to simply deny the latter's depth and breadth of thought, of his sincerity and general honour and decency.  It makes me very, very sad to see mainstream American media treat him so unfairly.  \n\nIf you don't want him, perhaps we could import him.  A man with substance.  Imagine.  But you need him more than even we do.  Please support him if he wins the nomination; he supported your Ms. Clinton.",

Our next president should embrace comity among dissenters as a basic style of governance and should strive to honour and cherish dissent by respectfully challenging those differing views on their merits.\n\nIt is the mark of an effective leader who likewise demands civil comportment and self-restraint from his sometimes unruly coalition.

The other 52% voted for Hillary or the Green Party, or something. The 52% hate Trump, and it's hard to imagine Trump winning any of them over after three years of his divisive antics.\n\nSo for the Democrats this should be easy. All you have to do is have a moderate candidate like Mike Bloomberg who immediately books the 52%\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey have nowhere else to go\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand then starts chipping away at Trump's 48%.\n\nThe LAST thing you want to have is a candidate who's marketing socialism and who is leaving a lot of people drifting in the middle. You lose your chance to win over any lukewarm Trump supporters, and with the talk of socialism you risk creating more lukewarm Trump supporters. And so voila, Trump gets another 48% or 49%, and we get four more years of the Trump evil. So sorry, Bernie's a great guy, but a Bernie ticket is a built-in disaster.",

Bernie is also very aware of the problems we have with climate change and has embraced AOC's climate ideas, again why is that a bad thing? He is a seasoned politician, a thoughtful and very intelligent man and he is the real deal when it comes to following through on his ideas. Bernie will also work with the Senate and the House to get things done and as Mr Krugman rightly pointed out, will to an extent be constrained by the rules and the process.

It would be more helpful politically and more accurate if he called himself a Social Democrat rather than a Socialist.   Social Democratic parties have long ruled dynamic capitalists countries since WWII like Spain, Britain, France,  Germany and the Scandinavian states for extended periods.  Tony Blair who is a polar opposite of Jeremy Corbin, was the head of a Labour Party when it was in power which has always been considered a Social Democratic party.  To my knowledge  Bernie has no plans to nationalize any existing private or public  companies.  Even his aspirational changes  in health care cannot be done by his fiat and probably would result in a public option similar to what was originally in Obamacare .   When the Trumpists poise, as they will, the question of whether you would rather live in the \"capitalist' US or the failed \"socialist' state of Venezuela, the answer should be whether you would rather live in Denmark or the failed crony capitalist state of Putin's Russia that  with little regulation, which in many ways the US is beginning to resemble, for many reasons, more each day.",

Hillary campaigned as the toughest neo-con in the room -- exactly the wrong position to adopt.\n\n-- there was a populist spirit on both the right and the left. Hillary totally ignored this, adopting a corporatist stance and focusing upon simply telling people how awful and corrupt Trump was. She also was corrupt, including her paid-right-into-her-own-pocket speaking tour at a time she was a not-quite-yet-formally-declared candidate for president and the renege on the pledge to shutter the Clinton Foundation at the start of the campaign\n\n-- of all the Democrats, Bernie has correctly diagnosed and simply explained the problem: gross income inequality, stagnant real wages for Americans who didn't go to college, the increasing purchase of government by corporations and the wealthy, sharply rising corporate profit as a share of GDP, and Americans dying needlessly because of the lack of healthcare. Bernie alone has explained this consistently in simple terms (Warren has too many detailed plans and ties them to an unconstitutional wealth tax)\n\nIs Bernie right for 2020? He seems too old.

Like Sanders, they wanted things like universal healthcare, marriage equality and greater attention paid to environmental concerns. But they spent their whole lives--whole long careers--kicking their real aims down the road in the interest of an electability they assumed came at the cost of those aims.

Unfortunately it seems they still fail to acknowledge this and I imagine it is because they are so afraid of ny changes to the status quo because the status quo has been very good to them.",

Thus the turnout for Sanders was good, and especially considering the particular demographics of Iowa  (91  % white). \n\nSanders is likely to do even better in states with more people of color and a younger population. If he gets the turn out of the youth vote that he did in Iowa, in the general election, he will beat Trump. If you look at the funny math by which the winner is calculated in Iowa, Sander's likelihood of winning a general election go even higher.\n\nWhat does Sanders propose, which has generated all the abuse from the NYT?

The reason we were disgruntled in 2016 was due to the irregularities of  the DNC and Superdelegates.  Much of that has been fixed.  In 2020 there is some grumbling about Sanders winning the popular vote of Iowa, yet losing the delegates,...I thought I understood caucuses, but apparently it's like electoral college, so okay.   A DNC exemption for Bloomberg, again, not great, but ok. The Sanders supporters will follow  Bernie's call to UNIFY no matter the winner, not just because of the rule changes, but (1) the candidates are all decent qualified people and say they are also committed to the winner, (2) Sanders will not be able to make another run and I presume we (his supporters) all know that.  If he does win the nomination, I think he will need a strong VP embraced by the DNC and moderates.  I like Klobuchar, and hope if she were asked in such a scenario she would consider it. But if Senator Sanders does not make the nomination, I think we will all rally behind the nominee.",

And, please, stop the sly rhetoric here. Bruni makes it very clear that Sanders and Trump are different only after he's made it clear how similar they are---that is, to him and other centrists---because they both talk about disrupting the status quo. But they are nothing alike. One has principles that he pretty much has stuck with all his political life. The other, if this country and its law were based in principle and not how much money one has so that one can rig the system, would have been in prison for his whole life soon as he had been found guilty of screwing over people who worked for him. \n\nThank goodness we can listen to these two and hear the vast differences in their anger and agenda and attitude.

That's because, unlike Corbyn, Bernie has a gigantic demographic shift at his back--the largest generation in American history, the Millennials. who love Bernie as much as Trump's geezers love him, are in the process of simply wrenching control of American politics from the quite literally dying Boomers, faster by the day.

Buttigieg, albeit bright and seemingly capable, is young and we don't know if he is experienced enough.

Americans do not have an idea how normal universal health care works, they never had a chance to experience it, and they are gullible to well paid anti-socialism rhetoric by well paid columnists and pundits.

Bill Clinton understood this, \"It's the economy stupid\" as did Obama. I looked back in history and in the past hundred years I found two cases where a candidate was voted out after one term. In both cases, there were economic problems around election time. Warren Harding is one and Jimmy Carter is the other. In every other case, the incumbent was elected for a second term. It also helps a lot when the candidate understand the media, is telegenic and likeable. That's how we got stuck with George W. Bush, a disaster by most accounts.\nBernie doesn't come across in the likeability category, and he's not telegenic. He comes across as an old angry man. His economic policies will scare a lot of people, especially when his past with Cuba, Russia and Nicaragua is brought front and center. \nHis medical plan is dead on arrival. Few people will accept getting rid of private insurance entirely with a public only option. I'm quite liberal and there's no way I could support his plan. Republicans will also  bring up Bernie's disastrous leadership of the VA when he was in charge of the senate panel, and Bernie rightly deserves some of the blame. He refused to hold hearings or help the investigation until after his house counterpart uncovered the scandal in spite of Bernie.\nBernie will cause 2016 all over again with all the Bernie or bust.",

They fear change because it threatens what they have.\n\nSecond they object to the way our form of governance enables people to behave contrary to what they believe is right and in many ways forces them to support those ways of behaving. For Trump\u2019s supporters that includes the liberty of people to have abortions, which they believe is immoral. Another are others attempts to infringe upon their liberties, including trusting them to keep and use their guns as they have for all of their lives. They expect the same respect for their liberties to control their own lives while they oppose others from doing so with respect to what they believe is wrong.\n\nWhat this is amounts to the loss of the popular consensus upon which our government is based.",

When is the last time a centrist candidate won an election? 20 years ago?\n\nHillary, Romney, McCain, Kerry. All center-left and center-right candidates, all losers. Trump, as awful as he is,  caught fire precisely because he promised to upend the establishment centrism that so many voters loathe. A black guy with the name of Barack Hussein Obama beat a respected senator and war hero because he symbolized a break with the moderate establishment that led us into a disastrous war.\n\nFact is, centrism has resulted in an America where a growing number of people are being left behind. Almost half the country can't afford to keep $400 in savings, one in five children live in poverty, we have half a million medical bankruptcies each year, Obamacare is ridiculously unaffordable - as is state college tuition. This isn't the fault solely of Republicans, it's the establishment of both parties that have orchestrated this sorry state of affairs.\n\nSure, Bernie may not win. But there's plenty of evidence out there pointing to the fact that a centrist won't win either. And that's great news. The \"moderate\" policies that are leaving so many people behind need to die. The voters have been screaming as such since '08. The GOP finally got it in '16 (even if it gave way to a would-be tyrant). If the Dems want to win again, they ought to listen too.",

If we run Bernie, Trump will win. \n\nPersonally, I think Trump will win anyhow, because he has a solidified base and party behind him, and a solidified message, and a fantastically efficient propaganda machine, and the Democrats are a goat-rodeo. Infighting, and a failure to create a unified message let alone a unified set of voters will defeat them. Trump has the ability to lie like a snake oil salesman and get people to buy the snake oil; the Democrats can't even prove the snake oil is a fraud.\n\nGo ahead, run Bernie. At least we'd put to rest the idea that he alone can defeat Trump, and maybe we could focus our attention on finding or creating the heart of the Democratic Party and finding real, viable candidates.",

My heart is with Buttigieg but I think Bloomberg has a better chance of winning. \n\nThe stark contrast between Bloomberg and Trumpy is compelling. A big part of Don the Con\u2019s appeal is that he\u2019s a \u201csuccessful businessman\u201d   \n\nBloomberg is a real successful rags-to-riches NYC businessman worth $62B   The twitter king is worth maybe $2B? thanks to Daddy and God knows who else.\n\nBloomberg has a media network in place AND boots on the ground thanks to his philanthropy.  Trumpski governs based on Fox News and was fined $2M for bilking his own charity. \u2028\u2028\n\nBloomberg has bipartisan appeal and is a skilled politician.  He\u2019s a lifelong Democrat but ran on the Republican ticket for NYC Mayor\u00a0to win, which he did 3 times, the last term as an Independent.\n\nIn short, pun intended, Bloomberg is a much bigger man.\n\nHe's a king of sorts but in the age of Citizens United, 21st century information wars and in the land of uber-capitalism he\u2019s the best chance we\u2019ve got.   He\u2019s 77 but appears to be in good health.  With VP Klobuchar in place, we\u2019ve got a good back-up.   \u2028\n\nWarren would make a great VP too.  Why?

HRC was one of these people. She barely lost to Trump.  Trump himself said that 2016 would've been harder with a Clinton/Sanders ticket. Imagine a Gore/Nader ticket in 2000.\n\nJudging by pure #s at this point, the Sanders+Warren camp is still polling lower than all the others combined. So the moderate wing is slightly stronger but not by a whole lot.  They both need each other.\n\nSo my point is that these two wings of the D party have to compromise somehow. When they do, they win. They were able to compromise for Clinton and Obama for various reasons but primarily charisma. \nA ticket is a way to compromise.\n\nSteve Bannon said Ds will lose in 2020 for the above reason: the inability to compromise.  This is a problem Ds have, since the moderates have been infiltrated with disaffected Republicans (the big tent has gotten bigger). Only a full ticket with cabinets can signify that compromise.",

Donald Trump will win a second term. I didn\u2019t think so before, but I\u2019m ready to bet on it now. \nHillary Clinton lost the electoral college by 110k votes. Bernie will lose by way more than that. I was gonna sell my condo in Thailand. I think I\u2019ll hold off.\nOne more thing: why did Trump go after Biden, but seems to embrace Sanders? Just guess...",

That is not a serious contender and you should stop wasting ink on him. What is really astounding is to read the NY Times and watch it's reporters and pundits twist themselves into pretzels to ignore the obvious. Bloomberg is in the race...for the Democratic nomination and the only fella who seems to understand how to build those numbers is Mayor Pete who turns out to understand the numbers as well as Obama did. Ah yeah, but he's gay. (Sorta like Hillary was a woman and she womped Trump in the vote, or Obama is black and he won two terms...I daresay if Pete wins the popular vote and Putin again the electoral college, Pete will know how to dislodge the pretender from the White House...as will Mike; the other ones, not so sure). But I also agree with bigred642, we have to swing the Senate and keep the House. I think Bloomberg is the best bet to create some coat tails in the red and purple states. Pretty hilarious to have Biden railing at Pete for not being Obama when this past week Bloomberg was saturating the Florida airwaves with his ad featuring Mike and the Big O. I have to say, his advertising instincts are phenomenal.",

But Zach Mortensen's seminal statistical analysis shows that if we can reduce our income inequality to Canada's level, our gun violence deaths will drop from 16,000/year to about 1,500, a FAR more effective means than all the 2nd Amendment violating restrictions put together.  And isn't that what we ALL want?  To drastically reduce gun violence in America?\n\nBesides, if you LOOK at most of the problems our nation faces, it's counter-intuitive but supported by hard data that the one step of reducing income inequality will affect most of them (not pollution, of course).\n\nBernie excites people.  Biden, much as I respect him, does not.  Democrats who excite people win.  Democrats who do not excite people lose.  \nLook at Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Al Gore, Mike Dukakis, Walter Mondale, and Hubert Humphrey.  Even though George McGovern had strong ideas, he didn't excite people the way Eugene McCarthy or RFK did in 1968.\n\nBut if you look at EVERY Democratic winner since the Civil War, they ALL brought something special to their campaigns, from Cleveland to Obama.\n\nI don't think Joe Biden can win.

Sanders will get the best turnout, taking votes from dems, independents and some former Trump/republican voters. \n\nSide note: how sad it is that Trump has become the main focal point of the Democratic discourse.

It's hard however to assess any similarity between their \"leftist politics\" when one operates in a society in which universal care is a reality, accepted by all from left to right, and the other is considered an extremist in his society just for proposing it.\n2) \"Sound like any senator from Vermont you know?\" Actually it doesn't.

He is a decent human being who has never been in politics in order to make millions, which is the opposite of Trump.  He has funded his campaign with individual donations, and does not accept PAC money.  It's his honesty and authenticity which have kept him in this race.  The Democratic establishment and the pundits are finding out that voters like his honesty, his consistency, his decency, and yes - his ideas.  No wonder they're panicking.",

He also lacked Sanders' eloquence, passion and wit.\nRe. Sanders' state of health, I would venture to say his age doesn't show. I have friends in his age bracket who have all aged very well, and much younger friends who have not.  \nI remember Hillary first noting with some glee that her Republican challenger was a certain shifty character, a real estate tycoon nobody had on their list (the Internal Revenue being among them). Like her, I completely underestimated Trump. \nBut as Robert Shiller and others noted, we're likely to enter a global recession. The outlook may look much harsher in six months' time.

Scandinavian countries have capitalistic economies but with good social benefits. These countries permit the ownership of the private business, real estate, free trade, inheritance, etc. The only difference is that they have better safety nets. But capitalism and social safety nets are not incompatible. To the contrary, one of the ultimate aims of Adam Smith's capitalism was to make ordinary people happy. Scandinavian countries started free trade, international business way before the U.S. did. So, they have more advanced capitalistic economies. A problem with Americans, be leftists or rightists, is that they think they are the only model of everything. American capitalism is not the only kind of capitalism. So, just because American capitalism has problems, it does not follow that socialism is the option. Inductively, socialism is a failed ideology; socialism all ended up totalitarianism. Another problem with Americans: they do not know what it is to lose freedom. So, some Americans fantasize about socialism.",

In 2008 and 2012, the Republicans nominated party moderates, both of whom lost to Obama.  Meanwhile, the Tea Party caucus broke from the moderates and split the party in two, bringing  Boehner down in the process.  So the Party had one faction made up of unsuccessful moderates and a Tea Party faction too small to elect its own candidate.  That opened the door to a party outsider like Trump.  \n\nThe Democrats are now going through a similar process.  The moderates and the Progressives are deeply divided and it looks like they need something new and different to unite the party.  Sanders obviously is not that--he's the head of the Progressives and divided the Party in 2016, making him an unwelcome candidate for party insiders.  \n\nBloomberg is new and different. So, is Buttigieg.  Klobuchar and Warren are both Senators and Biden is the ultimate insider. That helps the two unconventional mayoral candidates, both of whom are mavericks and may be the needed uniting force.\n\nI disagree with Mr. Bruni -- the Democrats are looking to span their differences with outsiders and new blood, just as the Republicans were in 2016.

He needs overwhelming primary victories in states where even the Democrats skew conservative. He needs great polling in battleground states, not just nationwide.  And he needs to accept that Democrats are not angels. There will always be big money involved in the Democratic Party, same as with the Republicans. Bernie has no chance of changing that, because the Democratic Party is a coalition of free-thinking individuals. The Republican Party is a collective, an army in lockstep that tolerates no personal opinions and no independent thought. They represent an ever-shrinking percentage of the electorate, but their unity makes them nearly unstoppable. \n\nWe can rest assured of one thing: Democrats may have some billionaires on their side, but on the whole they will never be as wealthy or as terrible as those who back the Republicans. America needs all hands on deck right now. I hope Bernie will do the smart thing here instead of dividing our country even further.",

And that was before Ted Kennedy died and was replaced by Liz Warren's predecessor Scott Brown.\n\nBernie says we need a revolution.

Social Security, Medicare, the Interstate Highway System, the Moon Landing, EEOC (even if it's been fought against and undermined by conservatives ever since its inception), and as flawed as it is the ACA has provided health insurance to millions who could never afford any health care.

What he (and Warren) have not been as effective at is in explaining how MFA will provide more and better AND cheaper health care to EVERYONE, and how the current system - or simply adding a \"Choice\" option - will be far more expensive than MFA and deliver less.\n\nSince the survey you referenced was taken over 7 months ago I believe people's understanding of MFA has in fact widened, and more would support it, but still more education is required.

How will Mr. Sanders work with Republicans then? or even with Democrats?\n\nThe public appear to have cemented into their heads this notion that a promethean outsider will lead us all into the light\u2026 but more desperately needed are experienced legislators. Given Mr. Sanders\u2019 reputation for being irascible and unable to compromise, and given a current absence of meaningful bills chaperoned into law by him, it\u2019s difficult to imagine Pres. Sanders ushering in the much-needed change the USA requires.\n\nPerhaps, as I\u2019ve imagined again and again over the past few days, this is where having an experienced legislator on the ticket would come in handy. If Mr. Sanders does secure the top spot in the Democratic Party\u2019s primaries, maybe he should consider Sen. Warren for a running mate. In a polarized era, against all odds she oversaw the creation of an entire new government agency: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau!",

As noted, he'll easily beat him. No, the biggest obstacle is the DNC and the establishment Democrats and their lapdogs in the press, particularly at this newspaper. The DNC already was busted for rigging the 2016 primary. Thank you Donna Brazil for discovering the secret agreement between the DNC and  the Hillary campaign and for revealing what happened. Now, the DNC has stacked the platform committee with loads of corporatists, lobbyists, and ex-Hillary staffers. I don't think the Democrats realize what they are getting themselves into here.

And he won the presidency. Now, it's the Democrats turn as Bernie is causing establishment Democrats to convulse, because he is not in their control. Oddly, the 78 year old Bernie represents the new guard of the Democratic Party, who is successfully demonstrating that he can win votes while also rejecting corporate donors... and the truth is, establishment Democrats don't like that.

As a result, he has proposed his own progressive tax plan, which he claims he has the unique ability to implement if elected. As proof, in his recent Op-Ed piece here, he disingenuously cited his success in getting the New York State legislature to pass a tax increase after 9/11. True enough, but the fact that it had the backing of his cronies in the real estate and finance industries, both heavily affected, just might have had something to do with it; it was essentially a bailout for them, a handful of people. Sanders didn't need a sudden wake up call (by his pollsters) to promote such a plan; he's been at it for 50 years. People see in him someone who's been on-message his entire career. Does that mean he's uncompromising, or just brutally honest?",

Despite being a progressive, I started having doubts about Corbyn when he still didn't come to a decisive stance on Brexit at the start of 2019. The problem apparently was that the Labour leader was well aware a vast majority of left wing voters, about 75%, preferred remain, but he himself wanted to leave and negotiate his own deal. Balancing between both positions made him waste too many chances to ensure a second referendum. He even missed the golden opportunity to kick Johnson out of power when Tory rebels gave the opposition a majority.\n\nHe bet everything on the election, despite bad polls, but again tried to avoid the hot Brexit potato, instead of trying to convince more voters that Tories, not the EU, were the real enemy. To ignore the overwhelming preferrance of potential Labour voters was a dire mistake and he lost the election by alienating both Leavers and Remainers.\n\nBernie Sanders is in a very much different situation. Unlike Corbyn, he's on the right side of history, without any big issue that puts him at odds with a majority of center/left voters, polls show.  He'll simply bring the US up to standards of healthcare  & education of other industrial nations, that's a realistic goal for this rich nation, unlike Labour's manifesto. And his polls versus Trump prove he's a very strong challenger. He'll win that election, I'm sure.",

They like their government-subsidized corporate plans, but don\u2019t want those who can\u2019t get one to get the equivalent amount of subsidy, even though many of them are paying for those subsidies. This is the American self-interest on healthcare, and Trump will pit the subsidized against the unsubsidized by protecting those subsidies.\n\nThere is probably no way to outdo Trump in this department, short of hallucinogenic drugs. We are probably stuck with Trump and the damage he will do for the next five years.",

Millions of people with health insurance through that private system we're hectored to extoll, despite all evidence, still can't afford health services because the copays, coinsurance, deductibles, maximums, pharmaceuticals and extra services are so costly. As for education, government has a long history of supporting higher education  -- the land grant colleges through the Morril Acts in the 1860s, for example, publicly funded local and state institutions (fun fact: New York's own City University was tuition-free until the 1970s). The immigration system is in serious need to reform, and reform has always been part of the system. Why not look honestly at proposals on offer instead of mischaracterizing and dismissing Sanders' plan out of hand?  I'm not a Sanders supporter, but the ideas he proposes are outliers.

The transparently partisan mockery of an impeachment trail was an abject failure. The DNC/Clinton ally attempt to manipulate the Iowa caucus failed so remarkably and the fingerprints were so blatantly obvious that even the stupefied media had to pay attention to the real election interference underway. Pelosi rips up Trumps speech yet her heart skips a beat and her eyelids flutter at the chance to clap and wave to CIA puppet  Guaido. A bad week indeed and we haven't even got to the Durham and Barr show.\n\nSince the Times is not taking comments on the Pelosi speech ripping youtube video story I will post my thoughts on that here as well. It is obvious that the video is symbolic as was her act and it is perfectly accurate and true to the point it makes. By ripping up the speech Pelosi rejects and condemns everything it contains. Everything. Obviously there are two moments of praise and one moment of ripping. No one is saying that clips were concurrent. The point is that these are events that happened during the speech and this is what Pelosi thinks of it. There is no distortion of the events and her act and the Democrats attempt to say there is just further demonstrates they made a tactical mistake and will rue the day.",

Do some homework, such as listening to Trump Inc., and connect the dots.\n\nIn the Trump Inc. Podcast, episode Sept. 18, 2019: The Family Business, there is an interesting interview with Solomon Larte (spelling ?) a records management analyst under four US presidents. He worked in the Office of Presidential Records (OPR). Federal law states that every piece of paper that crosses the president\u2019s desk becomes part of the presidential record. Everything is forwarded to the OPR to be catalogued and filed. Everything proceeded normally until Trump became president. First, OPR found out that official docs were being thrown in the trash. Initially, OPR figured that perhaps T-rump did not know, so he was informed. That\u2019s when Larte began receiving Manila folders of documents that had been ripped into \u2018thumb-sized pieces\u2019 by the president before being sent to the OPR. Larte said that the OPR staff were then tasked with painstakingly taping the docs back together, \u2018like doing a jigsaw puzzle\u2019. He must have been too good at that, because after 25 years, a top secret clearance, and three other presidents, he was informed that his top secret clearance would not be renewed (you\u2019re gone). No reason given.\n\nDrip, drip, drip",

What I am hoping is that the majority of this country realizes that talking and giving expression to the horrors of this Administration are a waste of time. Entertaining, but from a political and operational perspective a waste of time. It is sad that the NY Times must debase itself by following the R/C.E Axis script because it needs to make a profit and doesn't know how to do it otherwise. I have faith that just like the Moral Majority before it, the Trump Majority is far short of it. In a way, this has been a lesson to be learned. This country had become smug and complacent and overwhelmed by its self-importance. Now it is time to man/woman up and do what has to be done, starting with bouncing these fake \"patriots\". Lest anyone think otherwise, there are as many guns in the hands of true patriots as in the hands of the fake ones, maybe more. Real patriots don't need to walk around with guns on their hips and ram their way into public places in order to prove their bona fides. Real patriots have always been the quiet ones that become fierce when needed. Trump and his cohort have shown themselves time and again to be paper targets just like bullies always are. That's why Melania hung the medal around Limbaugh's neck. One fake (immigrant) patriot honoring another fake patriot (windbag).",

And I won't disagree that the Iowa caucus crash and burn gave Dems a bum start.  But what does annoy me is the most well-honed snark Ms. Dowd reserves for Democrats--her favorite target. Having read Ms. Dowd for years, I recognize the pattern instantly: ridicule Dems' behavior even though it is not altogether different from mistakes made on the GOP side. For example, she criticizes Dems' internal sparring to position themselves for the nomination when so far it's been tame in comparison to some Republican campaign histories. I have only to reach back to the GOP 2016-candidate bloodbath where Rubio, et al were making fun of Trump's (hand) size and calling him every expletive under the sun.  Still, they \"won.\" And then four years earlier it was the GOP that was embarrassed in Iowa after touting Romney as the winner, only after having to rescind the announcement and declare Rick Santorum the victor eight (8) days later.  My point is, Ms. Dowd appears to save her thorniest scorn for the only group right now that's trying to protect this country from becoming a Banana Republic.  And this tendency recalls her own not too distant journalistic debacle--remember 2016, Maureen?",

From Politico:\n\n\"Under the Presidential Records Act, the White House must preserve all memos, letters, emails and papers that the president touches, sending them to the National Archives for safekeeping as historical records. But White House aides realized early on that they were unable to stop Trump from ripping up paper after he was done with it and throwing it in the trash or on the floor, according to people familiar with the practice. Instead, they chose to clean it up for him, in order to make sure that the president wasn\u2019t violating the law.\"\n\n(<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/10/trump-papers-filing-system-635164\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/10/trump-papers-filing-system-635164</a>)",

Instead, Steyer threatened the Democrats with financial support withholding if they didn't toe the line. Trump and the Republicans green light the pipeline extension anyway. So why would Steyer think he did something amazing?\n\nTrump may be Trump but all his power actually comes from others.

Pelosi was in complete control. She carefully pre-tore the page edges, so they would be easy to rip in dramatic fashion for the cameras. She neatly lined up the pages before she rented them asunder, completely upstaging the preening president* in the last moments of his SOTU show.\n\nWhat else to do with a speech full of lies? As Pelosi herself said later, \u201cHe has shredded the truth in his speech. He\u2019s shredding the Constitution in his conduct. I shredded his \u2018state of his mind\u2019 address.\u201d \n\nAnd she got to Trump, which was surely one of her objectives. He was incensed. He spread the right-wing lie that tearing up a photocopy of a widely-distributed document was illegal: \"You\u2019re not allowed, it\u2019s illegal what she did. She broke the law,\" Trump whined. It isn't. As Harvard Law's Laurence Tribe explained, \"...  her action was purely symbolic expression well within the protection of both the speech and debate clause and the first amendment.\" \n\nThis was one more time Nancy Pelosi put Donald the Impeached in his place.

We already know from this newspaper that Trump inflated the value of his properties when seeking loans from Deutsche Bank.  (NYT Mag 2/4/20).  If Trump is using those phoney valuations on his taxes for depreciation, this may be massive tax fraud -- a good reason to keep the returns secret.  \n\nTrump won the impeachment battle, but this is far from over.",

The transparently partisan mockery of an impeachment trail was an abject failure. The DNC/Clinton ally attempt to manipulate the Iowa caucus failed so remarkably and the fingerprints were so blatantly obvious that even the stupefied media had to pay attention to the real election interference underway. Pelosi rips up Trumps speech yet her heart skips a beat and her eyelids flutter at the chance to clap and wave to CIA puppet  Guaido. A bad week indeed and we haven't even got to the Durham and Barr show.\n\nSince the Times is not taking comments on the Pelosi speech ripping youtube video story I will post my thoughts on that here as well. It is obvious that the video is symbolic as was her act and it is perfectly accurate and true to the point it makes. By ripping up the speech Pelosi rejects and condemns everything it contains. Everything. Obviously there are two moments of praise and one moment of ripping. No one is saying that clips were concurrent. The point is that these are events that happened during the speech and this is what Pelosi thinks of it. There is no distortion of the events and her act and the Democrats attempt to say there is just further demonstrates they made a tactical mistake and will rue the day.",

Each week, Pelosi and Schiff take the podium and deliver the OUTRAGE OF THE WEEK.\n\nFor example, the $11 billion border wall. Trump seeks to curtail entry of illegals into the US but the method he selected is inefficient, proven defective, and hideously expensive. In contrast to Trump's $11 billion wall, Israeli soldiers on the Gaza border use drones for surveillance that transmit live footage allowing patrols to focus their efforts where needed. Drones are electric and can remain aloft for long periods of time.\n\nThe OUTRAGE OF THE WEEK is probably discovered thru the contractor lining his pockets building the ineffective wall. Using congressional subpoena power, get to the root of the kickback and use the podium to disclose the malfeasance.\n\nAs the stench from uncontrolled looting permeates every American's outrage, perhaps we'll be able to remove the rot currently infecting the WH.

I try not to worry about the future of the country by looking back at its history and Jim Crow, and the lot but I am worried about the democrats being so confused that they do not see a path to removing this guy from office. I am a registered democrat and plan to vote for whoever is chosen in the primaries but seeing how homofobic parts of this country can be I doubt mayor Pete will do it, seeing the attacks on Bernie's socialism and Biden's perceived corruption problem in terms of his son, I am very concerned and as many a person from New York think maybe Bloomberg might do the trick. I like Klobuchar too.  I think Bloomberg with VP Klobuchar or Bloomberg and Stacey Abrams, who knows, crossing my fingers and hoping for the best but expecting the worst and also hoping the young Bernie people understand that if he does not get it they must get behind whoever and play ball because we need all the coalitions we can get in order to win and also a plan to get him physically out when he refuses to leave. what happened this week was appalling and must be stopped. hope we survive.",

Problem is A-many don't accept the fact of Putin's interference and B-the Senate basically green lighted the same scenario for 2020. So we need a strong candidate man or woman who can take the fight to trump. Yes there needs to be a focus on the corruption and lies but also on his record and show the difference between the what is and the what needs to be. I've offered this before. Tell me I'm wrong.\n\n1-Education: K-12 and beyond. Free and low cost options for post K-12 education and training will power the economy for the remainder of this century. \n \n2-An entire redesign of our national infrastructure which includes our energy grid and energy production along with transportation and public buildings. Focus on renewables. \n \n3-Healthcare for all at an easily affordable price. There's lots of existing models. Let's  come up with a hybrid of the best that works for us. \n \n4-A complete overhaul of taxation and banking which provides more transparency and places the burden of taxation where it belongs--on those who profit the most. \n \n5-Term limits and campaign finance reform. 3 term limit for Senate. 16-20 year limit on SC justices. Public financing of elections.\n \n6-Election reform: Secure elections, end of gerrymandering, remove electoral college. End Citizens United. One person one vote.",

Maybe if one of (any?) of these candidates would like to see real improvement in their campaigns, they might want to hire 'older' employees like me ? Our experience, input, abilities, intelligence, skills, etc. are equal and most likely superior to your 30 year old hires and I'm sure it would be ' campaign changing'. So if anyone candidates are interested, I'm available.",

It is true that no one in the world is flocking to immigrate to socialist countries, but falling on the economic sword to keep out immigrants and suffering the gray failures of socialism seems a tough choice. \n\nAs one commenter said, we're due for a recession. Manufacturing is down. Residential construction had been declining in 2019 until a year-end dramatically large but weird spike in new builds magically appeared. Something is brewing to trigger a recession and there is really only one place to go from \"more than full employment.\" Maybe it will be n-CoV.

He said, \u201cI called President Trump directly. I asked the President: \u2018What do you want from Ukraine.\u2019 President responded, \u2018Nothing.

Any one of them would make a great president in better times. \n\nThe thing is, what these deserving people lack is the blood-lust that Trump demonstrates every day. He's like Godzilla, back in the day when Godzilla was a bad monster who merrily stomped on Tokyo because he could, except in this case, Tokyo is our common values, decency and Constitution. We actually need a good monster to take Trumpzilla down, someone who has real strength and not bullying bluster. Someone who is not afraid to get his hands dirty if he has to, and that someone might indeed be Bloomberg. Everyone else is just too nice.",

He is worse than Dan Corleone and more spiteful and vengeful than Michael Corleone too.  \nThe Democrats foolishly and stupidly decided upon impeachment knowing full well that this was not Richard Nixon.

They attack each other but on issues, not ad hominem like Republicans. They showed respect and even regard for each other. Those are hallmarks of maturity and rationality. They don't personalize everything and become spiteful. They are an administration-in-waiting.  \n\nThe problem is not the candidates. It is the elites trying to control the outcome.

They obviously haven't found a cure yet for Trump derangement syndrome.  Petulant Nancy Pelosi and her crew of crusaders (Schiff, Nadler, Schumer, Waters, Aoc and crew, et al) has shown in just one short week how silly they are.  Not only did impeachment not work, it blew up in their faces.  Tearing up the state of the union address was one of the most petulant childish acts I've ever seen, but something I've come to expect from dems.\n\nBut the worst of course is the Iowa debacle.   Here's the party of big government who wants to run everything and they couldn't handle a simple election.  Hint people, you test software a lot before you go live.  And hiring Clintonites to produce software probably isn't a good idea. \n\nThen we have their candidates for president.  None of them can beat Trump.  Think it through -- you've got a committed socialist, a second who is almost (although she grew up on a reservation, so who knows), a boy mayor of a small town, and someone who is suffering from lack of charisma and has gotten shall we say, slower.  \n\nGood luck dems.  I'd start planning for 2024.",

It is bizarre but this country has been flipped by conservative talk radio, Fox News, Breitbart News, and the combination of Steve Bannon and Donald Trump.",

Trump's going full-tilt at implicating that only he may be trusted.  Allied to that monarchical notion is his requirement that, \"How do you tell who is subversive of `American values'?\"  Why, of course, the King himself will declare who is to be trusted and who is to be dismissed from his court.  This long slide of the Republican Party has been going on for 50+ years.  Much of the American media has been cowardly in its portrayal of Donald J. Trump as \"just a different kind of president\"  The bodies pile up.  The man clearly has an \"enemies list\".   The man knows how to take those whom he defines as members of \"the Deep State\" out of service.  Meanwhile, far too many Americans are bemused at this tactics and his long term strategy.  Trump is holding Court.  He speaks, and 93% of Republican Americans report that he is doing a \"great\" job of being president.  In sum, Nixon's Southern Strategy has come home to roost in the manner of a highly redefined Republican Party.  We are not about to witness the long American tradition of a peaceful transition between parties.  Be prepared. Donald Trump acts like the King.  You, me, we all, are simply his \"subjects\".

If you want to blame someone, blame the big-wigs who decided to take the caucuses digital in the name of \"modern efficiency.\"  Not only did they attempt to \"fix\" something that wasn't broken, they foolishly didn't bother with a complete dry run of the app weeks ahead of time to make sure nothing was amiss.  And don't forget, they assured all the precinct leaders that anyone who struggled with the app or didn't have a smartphone could just call in their results as usual.  Those who did this--or tried to--were doing what they were assured would be acceptable.  So lay off the grass-roots, front-line volunteers who sacrificed a lot to enable their friends and neighbors to come out and participate in democracy.

He is removing anyone he sees as standing up to him.  When have we seen this behavior in this country?  Soon, there will be no one to stop him - not Congress or the courts.  The Justice Department now steers its firepower increasingly toward those who oppose this budding tyrant.  When will the citizens of this country wake up and realize the dangers building on the horizon?  With the GOP Senate stacking the courts, soon there will be no checks.  The GOP controlled Senate has shown their true colors.  \nEvery time the GOP has had this much power, it has never ended well for those of us in the 90%.  Think Venezuela cannot happen here - think again.  Chaves was a populist too.  He eroded the government over time.  We are seeing the same thing.  Trump has no one left around him to check his impulses.  Democrats are fighting with each other over policy issues.  Wake up!  Policy issues will be decided by the White House if we keep focusing on the wrong problem.  There are two problems in this country = the GOP (Grab Overarching Power) and the current occupant of the White House.  If those of us who want this country to remain a republic with three co-equal branches of government don't focus on these two items - everything else will be moot!",

Since then, the Dem's have hardly offered any alternative programs, the Democrat Governors in the big States have appeared obstructive, and the no win impeachment process took up all the oxygen in the room. The regional numbers on either side haven't changed much. Pelosi has been neutered, Schumer is a no show, and the party is leaderless.  I've lived in DC long time and many of the higher ranking traditional Democrats are very unhappy with Tom Perez' leadership. There is not enough cash to sustain a national campaign to unseat an incumbent President.  There is disappointment Democrats hung on too long to Hunter Biden, giving the perception of \"supporting\" him. That will hurt starting later in the year. Finally, the elephant in the room is Durham. His investigation is due about late Spring and it won't be about Trump.\nEconomically, It is a blue collar recovery and that will impact fly over votes.

To them, \"Well, because it has always been done this way.\" should suffice as well as just not addressing the question.  It is not that difficult...if you are not a dyed-in-the-wool totalitarian.",

He is a few months older than I am and was aghast - what had he EVER done to warrant a memoir other than make noise? Years later I walked to the health club near the Sheraton in Chicago early on Saturday morning and saw a line three blocks long, with men and women dressed in business attire. I asked about it and was told they were waiting to audition for THE APPRENTICE, a program I never watched. I asked why they cared what this loudmouth had to say. He gave a discount to friends for condos in the Trump Tower here and then rescinded the discounts when the market proved better. He got away with it though the cheated buyers were furious. I still don't understand why anyone pays attention to a bloated real estate developer, insecure, unschooled and incurious. I also don't understand why the companies and banks he cheated let him get away without consequences.",

All it took was Trump, McConnell and Roberts to lift the veil. Those men are playing by the rules that exist, not  the imagined rules that would apply to our mythological democracy.  Consider this:  Roberts swore in McConnell to be an impartial juror when he knew all along that Mitch had been coordinating the White House defense of the president, coordinating the acquittal with the other senators before the trial even began.  In our mythological thinking that would have been prejury and jury tampering,  In the real world it was just another maneuver that would lead to cheering praise of a victory celebration at the East Room.\nThose lamenting the death of our democracy, are really lamenting the death of the myth of our democracy.  One never grieves the person who has left him, but the myth in ones mind of what that person never really was, and that is what greives us most.",

Over time any true representation of the working and middle classes got co-opted by right wing money, forcing Democrats to abandon any such meaningful policies and become \"centrist\" while putting out an \"identity politics\" message for their appeal.  The rise of a Trump-type character (he is really just a placeholder for his base's views) to place an idea-empty but emotional populist message into that void was predicted by many since the early 90s.  At the same time the identity politics issue is a particular problem for the Democrats because there are too many identities - the Republican party has only one, being a white person who thinks a certain way, especially after Republicans and allied think tanks over decades convinced poor whites that their interests are the same as rich whites simply because their skin is the same color, dividing along race lines rather than class and income lines.  Thus the present confusion in the Democrat ranks over a candidate.",

If Ronald Reagan could come back to life, how aghast he would be to find that 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Republican Party has been duped into acquiescing to Putin's design to re-assert Russian influence and control over Eastern Europe. Perhaps Bolton's forthcoming book will explain further how Trump has led a Republican administration into fondness for authoritarians and oligarchs. Or perhaps the money trail, leading through the Trump Organization's murky financial dealings with Deutsche Bank, will ultimately be unraveled and reveal why Trump is so beholden to Putin. We can only hope that further revelations arrive before the November election, so that Trump's betrayal of American democracy can be clear to all.",

Even two Vindman\u2019s were required to settle that score.\n\nIn the East Room of the White House, Trump viciously derided some of his loyal lieutenants like Jim Jordan for his appearance after being an NCAA wrestler, Steve Scleise for getting \u2018whacked\u2019 like he did at a practice congressional baseball game and others.\n\nWhile Don Corleone valued loyalty almost above family, Don Trump never extends loyalty to anyone but his instincts.\n\nThe Democrats need to paint a scenario of an absolutely unbound Trump in a second term. They need to spend hundreds of millions on attack ads to make his socialism panic ads look tame compared to what he could do to settle scores in a second term.\n\nThis tactic worked for LBJ in 1964 when they portrayed Barry Goldwater ready to launch a nuclear war with all the staging even for that time to scare the daylights out of most Americans.\n\nThe time has come for Democrats to play hardball. Mike Bloomberg will be offering the money to get the job done. Are the Democrats ready to get down and fight or play nice and lose?",

Illegal immigration infuriates the average citizen of middle America, as does threatening to take his firearms.  Urban liberals may hate guns, but they are a cherished tradition to 100 million gun owners, the voters who are not spraying bullets in a few urban neighborhoods.

Our two front-runners of the moment: a grumpy old socialist, and a young mayor from a small Midwestern city who happens to be gay. This would be hilarious if it were a comedy. But tragedy awaits if we have another four years of Trump.

He is solidly progressive, highly capable, and has unlimited financial resources. Dems may have to swallow their dislike of big money in politics to get to a greater good. It may take a good billionaire to get rid of a bad one (if he really is a billionaire). It this occurs, the money will be well spent.",

This is especially crucial for the two candidates who haven't always been Democrats -- for different reasons.\n\nFormer mayor Bloomberg should figure out how to say that he's the 10th (or 12th) richest person in the country (world) and if *he's* willing to back either Sen. Sanders or Sen. Warren, \"anyone but...\" prospective voters thinking of their own finances should clutch their pearls a lot less. \n\nSen. Sanders should think of some way to convey to his supporters that any other eventual Democratic nominee  both deserves and needs their support. Maybe it's time to change his Senate plumage to VT-D.",

Instead of contributing to a presidential campaign, Bloomberg provides an opening for Democratic fundraising directed to House and Senate races.  Should he win the nomination, Bloomberg will be beholden to no one but the American people.

I understand moral imperatives, and noble efforts, but by winning the battle it has fueled a war that most likely we will lose. In the end, what has this done for our country?  What has this done TO our country? The division between us is now deeper, and I do not see that we have a Presidential candidate contender who can unite us.  We need a Barack Obama right now, and we do not have one.\nGiven that,  the only other option is to focus on taking as many House and Senate seats as possible.  I keep repeating, make ousting Mitch McConnell a priority. He is the linchpin in the levers of power, and has been the abominable driver of partisanship in the Senate for many, many years. Getting rid of him almost outweighs booting Trump and his obsequious minions from the White House.\nWhatever happens, I will support and vote for whoever the Democratic candidate is come November, and pray I was wrong.  We could use a miracle right now.",

This attitude manifests itself, too, in the technologically challenged, archaic methods that some state parties still rely upon to do politics.\n\nThe reality is that the Democratic presidential nomination system is broken. We've known that for many years, but when Obama was running it didn't matter. Caucuses are relics. There is no reason why such a system should be used in any state. Allowing one or two states to \"winnow\" the number of candidates is also anti-democratic. But the party shows no inclination even to consider regional primaries or a national primary, both of which would be far more likely to produce a candidate that has the support of the great majority of Democrats.\n\nThe Iowa fiasco is pretty much unforgiveable. Tom Perez and other bureaucrats at the DNC should know that Trump and the RNC will do anything - literally, anything - to win this election. Yet they show no sign at all of fixing long-standing problems, including improving turnout, expanding communications with voters in an effective and consistent manner, or effectively integrating technology.\n\nJoin the 21st century, Democrats.",

While he can write an otherwise clear-eyed (and admittedly eloquent) reckoning about the moral bankruptcy of the GOP, he still feels compelled to validate his tight-rope balancing act by drawing false equivalencies with the Left. Of course there are problematic aspects of cancel culture, but it\u2019s laughable to think that those drawbacks come close to those of a modern GOP that\u2019s shamefully anti-Democratic (and that since Trump\u2019s ascendancy has completely trashed political civility and decorum.) Not only that, but Stephens puts the rhetorical onus on comparably benign Cancel Culture by saying that Trump and his surrogates \u201care no better\u201d \u2014 not the other way around.\n\nI\u2019m interested to see how Brett\u2019s politics evolve as the GOP entrenches minority rule and becomes even more and more absurd and less and less tolerant of democracy (and even paying lip service to democracy) over the coming years. By that time, Brett will run out of false equivalencies and will have to reckon with his own (allegedly) rational-right position.",

Democrats are deer in headlights and red states keep turning their heads away except for Democratic Senator Doug Jones of Alabama. He stood up and will lose everything. Romney did the right thing, but will always have his job. Who is the most brave of the two?  The larger issue is that this was seen as so hard.  Wait until this Republican Senate has a problem they cannot control; Trump's demolishment of all three military academies, the withholding of federal dollars from all blue states, and the wholesale deportation of all black and brown people, and naturalized citizens, out of the country.  It's coming soon and we can all count on Republicans doing nothing.  Cruelty is the new norm and releasing military criminals who laugh and pose for pictures with starving, dead 16 year olds, in their laps, is our new American pastime.",

Mitt is (now) that man.\n\nI think Romney wisely did the math, concluded that he was, to today's Trumpians, an also-ran at best and, at worst, toast.\n\nWe will see, in the months after the election, the emergence of a new Mitt Romney, who, unable to act against conscience, will leave the Republican Party. Whether he declares himself a Democrat, or (if that's a bridge too far even for him) an Independent, he will caucus with the Democrats (like Bernie and Angus King do now) and vie to become their nominee in 2024.\n\nHe will run on his (previously forsaken) record as the purplish Governor of Massachusetts (\"The People's Republic\"), as the inventor of the prototype for phased-in, practical, Universal Health Care.\n\nDon't laugh! This could work out. Maybe after the Dems crash this election, too--which looks likely; after a year of fielding box-check candidates who engage mostly in food fights and wishful thinking, they will be in a new place. A place where a lone individual can break the cycle of Quixotic self-sabotage and get the job done.\n\nMitt in 2024?",

Mitt\u2019s pretty story was just an attempt to create soundbites for his next presidential run.  Unable to learn from history, Bret recognizes that Mitt has flipped and flopped repeatedly yet, just as dupes like him have looked at every economic bubble and believed it was the one that would never burst, has been conned into thinking Romney has finally found a hill he is wiling to die on.  As for the bright shiny myths of the Republican Party, it hasn\u2019t ever been conservative, it has always been reactionary and self-serving, vilifying anyone standing in its way as communists, n-word lovers, traitors, or the latest epithet dreamed up by party hacks this week.  Trump\u2019s anti-democratic, anti-American, mean-spirited, petty, immature, hate-filled actions are not an anomaly in the Republican Party, they are the distillation of its essence.",

Many years ago I read a passage in one of Bernard Cornwell's \"Saxon Stories/The Last Kingdom\" series books in which the hero, Uhtred, contemplates his situation. Destined by the Fates to a future he has no control over, and beset by the chaotic vagaries cast upon him by the gods, Uhtred surmises that the only thing he owns, the only thing over which he has control is  to whom he gives his oath. And so it is now. \n\nWe are not randomly bound to obligations. We bind ourselves with our oaths. Sometimes we say our oaths in public, as in a wedding, sometimes we whisper them silently to our hearts. Oaths are not simply something we do, but as Uhtred so wisely knew, they are the one thing that defines us over which we have control, to make or to break. In the end they define us.\n\nMitt Romney radiates honor. He made his oath to an idea, unlike in days past when oaths were only made to people of power, and he upheld that oath. He has every right to hold his head high. I am so disheartened no one else in his party had his courage and sense of honor.",

Before the EU would get all the resolutions together to respond, the US election would have already happened, and Trump could call his team back.

He had told the White House that he was leaving at the end of the month but Trump wanted his exit to be a symbol. And his twin brother was fired as well though he was not a witness. I suppose he was a symbol that revenge can extend to families as well. As a Vietnam veteran I am appalled at this treatment of patriots. Tell me, Senator.

It is the possibility of integrity and courage. It is a spark in the darkness that draws your eye and allows you to set your direction.\" \n\nWhen I think about you Senator, I will think about those 12 seconds, when you  quivered and so did most ( I can't say everyone given the political climate) and so will everyone who will watch this speech in the coming years. \n\nIf William Safire was alive and was looking to add speeches to his book \"Lend me your ears\",  your speech will undoubtedly be added.\n\nThanks\nvatsan",

They talk the talk, but they most certainly do not walk it.\n\nRomney has not always been perfect, but with this one act, he has established himself as far closer to perfect than the far-from-perfect phone call that the Donald Trump falsely claims to have held with Ukraine's president. \n\nHistory may yet judge Romney kindly after all, but it is the judgment of a higher authority that appears to matter most to him.

If he wants to show that his principles mean something more politically significant, he should resign from the lost Republican Party and become an independent and caucus with the Democrats. He would be welcomed there even with his conservatism and  would send a message that good people cannot remain aligned with today\u2019s Republican Party without harming our democracy, our Constitution, and true conservative \nprinciples. I hope he  and all decent Republicans consider resigning from this lost and authoritarian party because of their love of country, decency, and the rule of law.",

(That's a lot more than we can say for Collins, who usually talks a good game but then equivocates when it comes time to vote.)  \n\nIsn't that what Congresspeople and Senators are supposed to do?\n\nIsn't that what we citizens should expect from our elected officials?\n\nI'll call Romney a hero if he speaks out against McConnell obstructing the hundreds of bills that he's holding up.  I'll call Romney a hero if he speaks out against the lies and hatred spewed by the Rightwing Media Cabal.  I'll call Romney a hero if he calls out his Republican colleagues for propagating those lies and that hatred.

The screenplay itself was penned by Dalton Trumbo, the screenwriter who showed his own courage in defiance of the 1950's blacklist, broken by Kirk Douglas by insisting on Trumbo to write Spartacus' screenplay.\n\nJack Burns, Douglas' cowboy character, was assisted by his equine partner, Whisky, in an Oscar-worthy display of courage (if we had animal Oscars) just as the testimony of Dr. Hill, Ambs. Taylor, Yovanovich and Sondland and LTC Vindman among others added to our search for truth in the impeachment hearings.\n\nThe resolution of the film and the impeachment trial also parallel each other.  Burns' undoing is at the hands of Carroll O'Connor as a semi driver carrying toilets; the impeachment undoing is under the wheels of the juggernaut driven by Mitch McConnell carrying loads of craven filth from the halls of the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe outcome for Burns and for impeachment were well telegraphed in advance but the losses for both were no less dramatic for the foretelling.  The film has justly been seen as a classic and will be long remembered.  I am hopeful the 52 senators voting to acquit will be remembered in November and beyond as well.",

Not totally, but to some degree.  War was one area the framers thought some limits on Constitutional norms needed to be applied.  They didn\u2019t think so in an economic crisis because our economy was not developed nationally that much when the Constitution was written.  Alexander Hamilton was responsible for tying together a national economy, in great part.  So it is rational to think that if they could have foreseen such a crisis, they would have provided some response to it.  (My argument against \u201cOriginalism\u201d in interpreting the Constitution.)\n\nComparing FDR\u2019s time to today is ludicrous.  Trump\u2019s big issue (besides his narcissism) is immigration.  Immigration has clearly not risen to an existential crisis level as large the Great Depression or WWII, much less that other time an American president veered significantly away from Constitutional norms, The Civil War.  \n\nNot every war rises to those levels, WWI didn\u2019t, and Wilson\u2019s and Congress\u2019 support for the Sedition Act of 1918 was incorrect.  Turning against Constitutional norms should have a sign that says, \u201cUse in times of GREAT Existential Emergency\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s abandonment of Constitutional norms deserves reprimand.",

Romney showed his real persona, no backbone. And Romney showed his true colors with his comments on poor people, caught on tape, when he ran for President.

It also reminds me of Mr. Obama's bipartisanship, which was or is still ridiculed by many people who are engrossed in party-politics.
