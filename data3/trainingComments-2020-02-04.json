Kevin Roose's article posted in the NYT today is worth reading on this topic: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/technology/election-tech.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/technology/election-tech.html</a>.  Roose writes that there is a \"silver lining\" in what so many are mistakenly calling a \"Democratic debacle\" in Iowa: \"When it comes to the actual business of registering and counting people\u2019s votes, many of the smartest tech experts I know fiercely oppose high-tech solutions, like \u201cpaperless\u201d digital voting machines and mobile voting apps. After all, every piece of technology involved in the voting process is a possible point of failure. And the larger and more interconnected the technical system, the more vulnerable it is to an attack.\"  We need to keep this in mind during the primary process and as we prepare our nation for the critical November voting.  Let's make sure that in every state there is, at minimum, a real paper ballot and tallying process--whether it's the main process or a validation check on fallible electronic systems now in place and too late to change.

Primaries with extended voting allow much greater participation with few of the problems we see in Iowa, and it also less likely that a dedicated army of a candidate's partisans can cancel the popular vote pick by overwhelming a caucus.  This happened in two states in the 2016 campaign.   Its times to  replace the  \" democratish\"'  Caucus  with  the more democratic primary.",

They exclude the disabled and others people who simply are not able to take a few hours out of their lives. I propose that the Democratic Party replace the caucuses with a system of ranked choice selection (we could avoid calling it \"voting\" so as not to ruffle New Hampshire). Citizens would select their first, second and third choices, and the selections would be tallied, dropping off candidates who don't reach the 15% threshold. This would be also be a great way to exhibit the power and benefits of ranked voting.\n\nI'm a software developer, and and I'm opposed to any sort of voting that depends on software. (Let that sink in.) I am also a resident of Oregon, where we have only paper ballots and vote-by-mail for everyone. Fill out your ballot at home, and send it in any time in the couple of weeks before Election Day. Easy. If we combine paper ballots, vote-by-mail, and ranked voting, we could conceivably end up with the best election system in the world.",

Under the old system, only one data point was required: who won each of the 1,600 precincts. In 2020, they required more data: i.e., the numbers of voters caucusing for each candidate in round 1, then the results from round 2 when supporters of candidates with less than 15%, i.e., those deemed non-viable, had to either join another candidate group or leave. Conveying that information required more 'bandwidth' than a simple telephone call so they created an App for that. Only they did it on the cheap and never tested it. KISS. They should have simply saved the paper ballots they had each attendee fill out to create a record in case the vote was too close to call, and just phone in the winner as in years past. KISS.

Hold their caucuses prior to the onset of actual voting primaries if they must, but quit putting the nation through debacles like last night. They should be relegated to a primary date more befitting their actual relevance- maybe somewhere in the middle, where they don't have outsize influence as first in the nation bestows and not at the end, when they could influence a close campaign.  \n\nHopefully everyone moves on from this disaster quickly, like they do from the daily disaster that is the Trump administration.",

In my precinct Klobuchar received about 12 percent of the first preference count, but in the end received no delegates. Other candidates probably experienced  similar outcomes in other precincts. My hypothesis is that the leadership expected these discrepancies to average out such that at the county level there would be a close match between the initial preference votes and the distribution of delegates. When this did not happen the first inclination was to look for data errors, and there no doubt were some, but in fact the  real problem was probably that  surprisingly large and awkward discrepancies between the preference counts and the final delegate distribution implied that there were errors when the data was in fact correct.",

Safe and vacuous is what he's openly selling to voters most worried about what they imagine other voters, Trump voters, white voters, might dislike. He's got older African-American voters so enthralled in that worry that the party lost its African-American candidates even before last night's disaster, for lack of African-American support in the polls. Women candidates face the same peril.\n\nBernie Sanders didn't \"match\" Biden's vacuity. \"I have a strong feeling that at some point, the results will be announced\" was fully ironic, said with a mischievous grin, and the funniest, wittiest line of the night. Calling that a match is both gratuitous and dead wrong.\n\nPlease, if you want Democrats to unite after the primaries to beat Trump, as we all do, just give Sanders his due. Stop this incessant 2016-holdover sniping at every opportunity.

Trump. Don\u2019t expect Republican congressional leadership to balk at any sign of a Trump or a Trump surrogate move to suspend the election if it looks like it\u2019s going to close. Democrats need to be prepared for any Trump move to muck the 2020 election up - because there WILL be an attempt if the election is close.",

Wanting to know ahead of time ... and the more so the better ... has become an American obsession in so many domaines, not just this political one; and is revealing about where we Americans are maturity-wise, anxiety-wise. Hype seems to drive the phenomenon ... people becoming inflated in their importance about something, by the press reporting on this as importance; and then back to inflating the people who become even more frenzied than before in their considered authority; and then back to the press; etc. Our insecurities, revealed in arrogance of this kind, are hurting us badly. It\u2019s no wonder we wound up with Trump ... whom we may well have again. And this through resignation deriving from dependence on reported opinions that themselves may be spurious. Consensus is important for America; but rallying through hype and conforming resignation is not the way to get there.",

Biden can say he is walking out with his share of delegates while he didn't even hit the 15% to get delegates is more likely. Buttigeg can claim victory with no proof . I wonder if he had to get advise from his Mackenzie  and CIA buddies on how to keep the Des Moines Registers gold standard poll hidden.\nGood thing Sander keeps a record of votes after Hillary lied about winning in Iowa 2016. She didn't have as many votes but had more delegates. That sounds Super now doesn't it?",

Our first four states are like that and each represents a different region of the country. It is a pretty good but imperfect system - the kind that good engineers might leave alone because the downside risk of a change outweighs the possible benefit of going from good to great.\n\nThere is another factor - Iowa has a history of being first. Our politics are so messed up and hyper-analyzed, what entity could agree on which state is first and stick to that agreement over time? \n\nMuch like thinking present-day electric cars in America will actually fight climate change, blaming the state of our politics on the odd sequencing of primaries is between being useless and being outright counter-productive.",

Sure the Dems have the better policy ideals, but they are so dazzled by their moral superiority they are unable to formulate a coherent strategy to defeat the beast. By now intelligent people can conclude The Repubs do not play by rules of the game, but rather change the rules as they go along to suit any predicament that comes up. (i.e. Merrick Garland, neutering  Dems Governor's in NC, MI, WI, etc..) The  Dems responses to these challenges to their ability to govern, essentially following the former legislative processes that 'no longer apply', have proven to be completely ineffective and damaged their ability to govern subsequently. The old saying ' do not bring a knife to a gunfight' might be useful for Dems leadership to acknowledge. They need bare knuckled, change that to  Brass knuckled, tactics to counter the Repubs continuous re-writing of the constitution.",

What is this, some sort of living Lego's game where the supervisors can't decide what they are trying to make and the whole thing collapses? And then there are the extremes within the Democratic Party. Extreme left-wingers trying to fit-in with so-called moderate folks like Biden. Or socialists trying to claim the are a part of that -- they are not. And the smartest one of the group being gay. I read in one of the comments in the main story that, perhaps, the Dems in charge of Iowa don't like the results they are seeing. That guy may have a point. Throughout the coverage there are many photographs of the tally: in all, Buttigieg is in the lead followed by Sanders. I doubt the Iowa farmers who run the state party could stand either a socialist or gay man winning. But hey: that's what you get when you run a political system that most people don't understand.

And the speed with which I have seen Bloomberg comments blow up usually would indicate someone is being paid to make them.\n\nThis is HUGE in an election year.

There was no \u201cOne, two, three, and away.\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.  However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were qjuite dry again, the Dodo sddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all crowded around it, panting, and asking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d\n\n\u2014This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.  At last the Dodo said, \u201cEverybody has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d",

I participated in the 1980 Iowa caucuses and agree it's too homogeneous and small a state to be the first test of popularity for national politicians. And now it can't even manage to report its results in a timely coherent fashion.\n\nThat's why Pennsylvania would be a much better state to be \"first\", with our diversity of urban/rural, some ethnic diversity (mostly east), and reasonably large population (currently split between the parties, suggesting \"centrist\" is the median political view of most in the state). I wouldn't look forward to the barrage of ads leading up to such a caucus or primary, but PA would be a better test than Iowa.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"first\" primary should probably occur in multiple states on the same day, so a \"Super Tuesday\" comprising a collection of states representative of the country as a whole.  That would give a better idea of which candidates reflect the interests of the nation's voters.",

In an era where Democrats are pushing for more and easier ballot access, it's hard to imagine a system that rewards activists vs. everyday voters more than this one.\n2. It's convoluted. Especially in this year's version of the Iowa caucus, where both raw vote totals and delegate counts are reported, it's hard to figure out the winner. The tech meltdown is the icing on the cake, not the root cause.\n3. It rewards peer pressure. Everybody has been in a \"show of hands\" situation, starting with grade school, where people look around before raising their hands. Is the caucus really that different?\nRegardless of the expected results (Sanders on top, Biden tailing, and so forth), nobody can claim victory after this fiasco. Iowa deserves to lose its place in line, unless it commits to a primary format (and paper ballots) in 2024, and that still doesn't address its homogeneous demographics.",

Lo is incredible, very talented, an intelligent businesswoman, a fine actor and a uniquely charming celebrity.  But everything about this performance seemed painfully forced.  It's laughable that people are obsessed with the tiny outfits which are not tiny at all but cover most of her body.  And yes, she is in incredible shape, not just from genes but likely an extreme regiment of diet and workout.  She worked for that people and she has been working on it for decades.  She earned it and she looks great for any age.  The obsession with her being fifty is so pedestrian, as pedestrian as the hair, make-up, outfits and peek-a-boo crotch shots at the camera.  If this is really the idea of what sexy is, in 2020, I think we have a long way to go.  So, no, I don't think any woman of any age needs to judge themselves by this performance or J. Lo's body.  This is such outdated and rather pandering thinking.  Sex is in the mind, not the body.  The longer we drag this old stereotype along the more silly it becomes.  I felt no intrigue by the performance which seemed painfully curated to elicit just this response...\"A woman can look like that in her '50's!?\".  Of course some can, especially if they've been working for it for the last thirty years.  It's not magic and in the end it's not even that interesting.  Write a great song, sing soulfully, dance incredibly...that's sexy.",

The dancing, while quite athletic, wasn't particularly beautiful.  The only charm came from the enthusiasm of the little girl dancers and JL's daughter singing.  Even with the political and cultural moments, it never appealed to my heart.  There was no humor, no melody, very little fun - just an aggressive energy that had no center or focus.  Take away the colored lights and what is left?  JL on a pole?  OMG, really?  Why?  Zzzzzzzzzzzz.",

Look like yourself, embrace yourself and be happy for others.  \n\nI agree with drwo (from 1 hour ago) that a man would never write this article  - that a many would be upset about another man's looks or physical stature and think he has to look like that other man.  \n\nSTOP IT Jennifer Weiner.  The article makes you sound like an immature whiner.   \n\nI am 60 years old and so I know what I am talking about.  I do expect to look like J Lo, or any other woman, and if anyone told me that I should, I would disagree strongly and then end the discussion.   I like myself and work on \"my\" areas that I want to work on.  \n\nPraise and celebrate that J Lo shows that a 50 year old woman is just as vital, powerful and sexy as a 30 year old woman.   More power to J Lo!   And more power to all woman embracing and celebrating ourselves and our bodies!!",

Why they feel compelled to undergo unnecessary surgery in a foreign country is a serious question. Why they feel compelled to speak about it in my presence is a personal question. I don't need to know about your 25 year old daughter in-law's unexpected trip to Barbados. My day would go just fine without that information.\n\nI feel the same way about J.Lo as I do about Tom Brady, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. We could throw in Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan and the entire Rolling Stones to boot. Go away. Youth is for the young. If you can't figure out how to be respectfully old, you really don't belong in the spot light. Jimmy Carter is a man who knows how to age gracefully. Nice person. Philanthropic. Keeps to his own business. No one would ever expect him to pole dance at any age.\n\nMs. Weiner hits upon the stranger thing though. Men better accept aging whereas women feel more judged by it. Despite being unfair and unhealthy, the contrast is curious. \n\nI'm perfectly okay watching 24 year old Patrick Mahomes accomplish athletic feats I will never accomplish in my life wearing basically nothing but a jockstrap and shoulder pads with women sitting next to me. \n\nWatching a 50 year old woman pole dance basically nude makes me strangely uncomfortable though. Like really uncomfortable. Attractive? Sure, I guess. But should she be?",

And granted, Ms. Lopez has a lot of incentive and no doubt a stable of support to help her stay athletic and limber and in performance shape, but you can't deny that she is a force and an example of what's possible. Does she look great?  Yes. But it's the grace and range (of motion :-) and dedication that inspires.  Do women feel intimidated by female marathon runners? Distance swimmers? Those women at the tennis club with worn and sagging skin in their skirts who can still serve an ace at 70? Don't think so.

It\u2019s true that men have largely shaped the institutions in our society to benefit themselves and ultimately place women at a disadvantage. This includes pushing women to adhere to unreasonable body standards. HOWEVER, the male perspective Weiner takes is extremely problematic. Belittling men down to simple-minded, nacho hungry spectators who lack the ability to have self doubt is the reason men feel emotionally unsupported and sheltered. Throughout history, men have been taught to hide their emotions which perpetuates a society where men are significantly less likely to reach out for mental health support. Weiner\u2019s article correctly displays the unfair body standards women face, but does so in a way that swiftly disregards the feelings men have.",

I think it's a safe assumption to say that her family could probably could not even advice her on how to succeed in American society, without even speaking of the world of entertainment. This is a woman who had to overcome tremendous barriers to Hispanics in entertainment and who probably had to put up with a lot of racism, sexism, and discrimination for being a Puerto Rican woman from the Bronx. Despite these obvious obstacles, she rose through sheer determination and hard work to become one of America's wealthiest and most influential women in entertainment -- to the point that people seem to forget where she came from and what she represents for many Hispanics in this country. J. Lo is the personification of the American dream. She's not only a performer but I would say has an uncanny marketing and business sense -- without even having a college degree. She not only mastered the playbook against all odds but now she's subverting it by being 50, gorgeous, and still successful, and by using her fame as a platform to highlight injustice and inequality. She's doing it in her own terms and there's a lot of power in that.",

I don't read fan magazines, if they still exist, but even I have read how disdainful she is of the hotel help (she won't speak directly to them, using her assistant as a sort of English-to-English interpreter right there in the same room), and she won't talk to the help on movie sets.

She's not telling people to stop exercising or not to care about their looks or health. She would never have written this about any ordinary person who happened to be blessed with good genes and an iron will to work out. Rather, she's pointing out that the irony that the history of impossible media and cultural standards for women's beauty -- which, I hope no one here will deny exists! -- is not, in fact, redeemed by the media spectacle of a 50 year old who can exceed them, but in fact are in many ways intensified by that. It's an excellent point about the exhausting messages women and girls constantly receive in the media. No one is telling you to get fat.",

Eat three hot, wholesome, homemade meals every day. Drink warm boiled water before and while you eat. Don't drink for an hour after you eat. Axe the sugar and alcohol.  Eat very little meat. Eat a variety of healthy foods. Stop eating cold food and salads.  Learn how big is your stomach and leave 1/4 empty at each meal.  \n\nNo \"diet\" necessary.

Musicians, ballerinas, athletes all invest most of their waking hours in their craft and we don't condemn them for it or compare ourselves to them.

You're also not \"supposed\" to look  like a stereo-typical \"well-seasoned\" person at age 50 if you don't want to. J.Lo looks awesome, because she wants to, and realistically, because she has the money, personal trainers, and time to do so. (Contrary to what some wealthy celebrities say, wealthier people DO have more time in their day than the average person does, but that's a different topic). As a celebrity, J.Lo's image is part of her job.  However, we should not internalize someone else's accomplishment as a failure on our parts. I commend her for how she looks, and I commend every woman or man who is happy with how they look, so long as they are healthy.",

Either way it is her job people to maintain that body, to live up to that image she has made for herself and to the people that pay her. For me I found it inspirational, here is a woman who has worked hard and achieved her goals and loves what she does. I am trying to do the same thing aren't we all? Why do we as women compare ourselves to other women. We are each unique and have a special gift to offer this world, so let's celebrate each other.",

I said \"Why not you?\" to my wife, expecting a slap. No slap came. Instead I got an intrigued smile. Then she started grilling the woman on what was required. It was huge.\n\nShe asked if I'd support her bikini adventure. I said \"100%.\" \n\nNow, it's an online trainer, body-shaping gym 6 days a week, cardio boot-camp twice a week, a food app and Fitbit. She weighs each gram of food, has a perfectly balanced diet, no sugar, nothing deep-fried or boring (hot peppers, herbs and garlic have few calories). \n\nShe has never, in our 15 years together, been so happy, funny, confident and lovey-dovey with me. Her energy levels are nuts and men are flirting at her again -- which she loves, as do I. \n\nMy wife is 50, has J-Lo's hair, body shape and size, skintone and is fast approaching her level of fitness. Some 7-8 months ago she was 25lbs heavier, had a bad knee, was getting regular asthma attacks and eating crap. She runs upstairs. Knee and asthma self-repaired. \n\nI'm 60, always been fit because I love the feeling. A year ago, I told my wife she was opening herself up to scary illnesses being unfit at 50, not to mention that she was miserable and tired all the time. She bought in on that and went for it.\n\nBeing sexy is but one of many fitness benefits. Do it for the health buzz above all.",

And little to none of the tortured agony which is documented in the current article was on display. \nBut when the blithe and utterly off base comment that men, basically don\u2019t give a damn that they are nacho eating slobs even when confronted with visions of gorgeous Adonises who the ladies happily leer at, I wonder how women reach such sexist yet painfully predictable conclusions. \nFeel free to be haunted by JLo. But don\u2019t appropriate my right to feel the same when women are openly drooling over Brad Pitt\u2019s abs. \nIn short, women:  please stop appropriating the male voice and telling us how we feel. Or than we are too emotionally blunted to feel the exquisite anguish you feel.  \nIt\u2019s offensive and sexist that so many women think that most men are not only physical lumps to be ignored, but are incapable of the exquisite anguish that you superior females are so capable of.",

They don't want to be stared at in public as if a man were judging a prize cow at a county fair, but, as one confessed in the Times, they want to be thought of as \"hot\". This desire is part of what motivates this column, which is a public fretting about what being sexy, attractive, means after a certain age.\n\nOne distant cousin confessed to me that, after 50 to 55, women \"become invisible\" in public. This brings up the saying (true or not) that the only thing worse than glaring at a women in public is to ignore her completely.\n\nAll of this serves to illustrate our general social confusion about sex and attraction. We hide many contradictions behind the facade of lifelong marriage, but women still want to be viewed as desirable by others than their husbands, perhaps to know they can still attract his attentions, perhaps for hedging their bets if the whole thing goes up in smoke.\n\nThrough this maze feminism sought to tell us how to live without resolving the glaring contradictions.

I have sat through job interviews with 30 somethings and could almost see a thought bubble that said \"why would I want to hire this \"old\" lady?\" I was too experience but not experience enough, or \"not the right fit\" and overlooked for so many jobs that I was so well qualified for and would have gotten 30 years earlier. I don't even look my age and certainly avoiding dressing in a way that gives it away but hard to hide these days with electronic job applications that make you put in every date. The sad thing is that JLo regardless of her singing talents, wouldn't be hired for gigs like that if she didn't have the smoking hot look. That criteria was not applied to male singers such as Mick Jagger when he performed at the Super Bowl.",

They remind all of us that we are a society undecided about what to do about the sexual impulse, whether to highly regulate it through marriage, let it fly lose through multiple, occasional partners or suppress it through religion. It's a mess and so are we. We haven't solved this problem.\n\nThe jiggly dancing reminded me of some women dancers for Ethiopia I saw performing once.

I don't recall this happening when Lady Gaga, Madonna, and Britney performed in similar clothing. I can only remember controversy over Beyonce. For me this phenomenon points to white fragility and racial prejudice. Something needs to be said about how women embrace sexuality and power differently in Latin America (and most of the world). Less plagued by leftover Victorian traditions of female censure. Jennifer, you don't speak for women. You speak for a select group of fragile white women. There is nothing wrong with JLo promoting health, curves and sensuality to other women. It's a good antidote to the drug addict look young girls had been fed by white supermodels and white fashion designers for decades. For many people JLo's excellence symbolizes hope, and a very Latin reminder that we can live joyful, passionate, full lives at 50+. Nobody is saying you need to get out of your mommy clothes, that's virtuous too. Don't feel personally judged, the performance was not about you or your insecurities. It was a Latina celebration, for once.",

Every morning the writer's Facebook feed is 'chill', just the casual Trump-related problems like kids in cages, black people being killed by our police, mass incarceration...But somehow JLo's body causes a firestorm? I think one thing to consider here is race...and priorities. All of the negative reviews of JLo or her performance that I have seen are being posted by white women. I don't recall this happening when Lady Gaga, Madonna, and Britney performed in similar clothing. I can only remember controversy over Beyonce. For me this phenomenon points to white fragility and racial prejudice. Something needs to be said about how women embrace sexuality and power differently in Latin America (and most of the world). Less plagued by leftover Victorian traditions of female censure. Jen, you don't speak for women. You speak for a select group of fragile white women. There is nothing wrong with JLo promoting health, curves and sensuality to other women. It's a good antidote to the drug addict look young girls had been fed by white supermodels and white fashion designers for decades. For many people JLo's excellence symbolizes hope, and a very Latin reminder that we can live joyful, passionate, full lives at 50+. Nobody is saying you need to get out of your mommy clothes, that's virtuous too. Don't feel personally judged, the performance was not about you or your insecurities. It was a Latina celebration, for once.",

She's much more fit and physically active than lot of teenagers in this country from what I can see. This costume is 80% powermesh spandex BTW, designed to shape and enhance. However, if you want to see how truly fit and strong she is without the 'enhancers\", find videos of her training for Hustlers; no makeup, hair in a bun, in sweats. Pole dancing is very difficult and takes major upper body and core strength. This is another reason, besides excellent genes, she looks the way she does.",

(It's a truly magical film that should be seen by absolutely everybody.)\n\nBut what brought it to mind now is that the old, discarded granny character is (magnificently) played by a 48 year old Beulah Bondi (and apparently played naturally, not aged by make-up or other artifice for the part). Her son is played by Thomas Mitchell (familiar as the uncle in \"It' a Wonderful Life\") was only 5 or 6 years younger than Bondi, yet is in the prime of his life as his (6 year older mother) is being sent off to pasture.\n\nSo if you want a really interesting comparison, watch 48 year old Beulah Bondi in that (again, utterly spectacular, an all-time connoisseur favorite) film to J. Lo at the Super Bowl. Then you'll really know how times and women's aging have changed.",

Either she knows no men, or those few she knows do not open up to her about men's issues with their bodies. Its worse for women, but nearly all of us guys wish we had those perfect athletic bodies too, but we do not admit it out loud, in public. Most of us grew up painfully aware we lacked the strength and beauty of the school jocks. \n\nLook at the lead male actors in any American movie and tell me how many are chubby or short. Those who are short are cleverly filmed to appear taller. Talk to any American man who is less than about 5 and half feet and ask them if they can get dates with women taller. \n\nIts true that there is a wider band of acceptable appearance for men, especially if one's flaws are mitigated with wealth or social status. Thus you see men like Trump or Jeff Bezos with a partner or succession of trophy wives far more physically attractive than they are. As Henry Kissinger said (married to a woman taller and prettier then he), \"power is the best aphrodisiac\". This does not seem to be as true for women as for men, but realize that the number of men who have wealth, power, and social status is a small minority.

In addition to lean, low percent body fat, wide receivers making diving catches, you also have very heavy offensive and defensive linemen who are very muscular, but also carry significant body fat.  Men don't watch the game to compare themselves to the athletes, they watch the game because of the competition.  J Lo on the stage is all about how J Lo fits a female stereotype of beauty and how she moves, as well as her singing.  The only competition here is if women decide that they need to compare themselves to her to see how they measure up to that stereotype.",

Sooo, in reality she is pretty hippy with wider thighs.  And, do you suppose she was wearing a wig?  My point is, girdles, wigs, and strategically designed clothing can give you a much improved appearance.  I still wonder about the singing because it was barely audible and could never be considered real talent.  \n\nI will concede that J'Lo is an attractive woman and she can do some athletic dance moves, but why the need to be a sexual object.

But more important: acting as if 50 means tunics and bifocals signals something other than a worry about physical appearance. It's that attitude that women over 50 are already old and sexless -- disposable and on the sidelines in shroud-like garments. Check out the That's Not My Age FB page and podcast - a huge rebuttal to all of that. Women our age don't need to wear only black (it really bothers me that so many of us dress like every day is a funeral, bc it's \"slimming\") and try with each encroaching day to take up less space, and I don't mean our butts, I mean our voices, our inner lives. Why do you have to dance in private? Before you capitulate to J Lo standards, get comfortable in the body you have. Be glad it works. Take some joy in movement - walking and yes, dancing. I suspect that even if you looked like her, you'd be hiding. Don't.",

I wear glasses. My right knee has had four operations. I sprained and broke my wrist last fall.  I'm learning how to play the violin, I read a lot, and I like a glass of wine at the end of the day. Elvis shook his hips. The Beatles had long hair (sort of). Marylin Monroe wore a tight dress for President Kennedy in 1962. Michael Jackson grabbed his crotch whenever he liked. Madonna was, Madonna, and Janet Jackson had some clothing problems. So what? Lighten up, campers. Life is too short to worry about this nonsense. We're all doing what we can to get through it. So, let's look at it this way. I'm alive. I'm healthy. I really don't worry about what anyone else look like - good, not so good, and so forth. The whole thing is a mysterious trip, so why worry? My grandfather made it to 84, and my dad to 83. I'm just going to keep on rocking until this dance is over.",

Take Harvey Weinstein, no woman would give him a second look if he didn't have power to make or break careers in Hollywood.   Les Wexner who built Victoria's Secret  catalog on the premise that 'any woman' could wear reasonably priced lingerie until VS stores reached critical mass acceptance then came the Miracle Bra, the Angels on the runway and the diamond encrusted bra.  VS was no longer about empowering the customer, the customer had to meet the VS standard.  (You try looking that good 6 weeks after giving birth with staples in your stomach.)  No surprise that the VS mentality fostered monsters like Jeffery Epstein and Ed Rasek. \n\nMy point is that, yes, woman can feel empowered by pole dancing and wearing lingerie - but each woman should be judged by her own size, shape and appreciated at standard of health and fitness that is appropriate for her own circumstances - not judged some impossible fantasy unless working out is her full time job.   If she works - in or out of the home, cooks, cleans, raises the kids, etc. then her body will reflect it, yet that is what should be valued about her appearance.",

Singing \"Born in the USA\" while wearing a jacket patterned with the American & Puerto Rican flags was a particularly nice touch. That the two of them are stunningly athletic, poised and, yes, beautiful, at an age that our society traditionally considers well past prime made the show all that much better.\n\nUltimately, we are watching championship games because we are watching the best of the best compete while they are at the top of their game. We just saw two middle-aged people who have been at the top of the game for several decades.",

As a man, I've noticed cultural changes with respect to men and their bodies (and no, I am certainly not suggesting that they face remotely the same judgment as women.) Many younger men in locker rooms seem to get dressed under towels or in bathroom stalls. A gym I had been going to for years decided to make the showers individual stalls with barriers and curtains instead of the communal setup they'd had for years. Whence this quest for privacy? Are the judging eyes everywhere? Has technology made us all 9th tier celebrities with audiences we need to cater to? Why is it looking \"good\" not looking \"fit\"? Why is one's fitness level a signifier of something beyond fitness? We all know that no matter how smart you are, there is always someone smarter. No matter how attractive you are there is always someone more attractive. Or, conversely, no matter how bad you've got it there is always someone who has it worse. It's one thing to aspire to be fitter and healthier, and to see images of fitness and beauty, but the climate that puts our very identity is at stake is profoundly unhealthy. Maybe I go to the gym because I like it, not to make a statement about my looks, which is in turn a statement about my inherent value as a person. Maybe a read because I like it, not to make a statement about how intelligent I am. We could all do with a little less self-reflection and dispense with the task of proving we are worthy of taking up space. It's tiring.",

The difference is that a man's self-consciousness is \"unmanly\" and not to be spoken of. It's the same suffering, but with no socially-acceptable outlet for expression.",

These women looked great at 21 as well as now at their current ages.  Almost all people do not have the aptitude to be J Lo and Shakira at any age or price.

Try and stay fit for health reasons certainly , but I wish you would stop judging your looks because the brain and the heart mean a lot more than inches.\n\nA case in point is some of the comments on here from  dancers and such saying \"i still look great at 65\" and \"don't give up at 71\" - that's fine, but it's also judgemental. Maybe YOUR body is built like that. A lot of other women's aren't.

J Lo has all of that because she's got a job that requires her to.\n \nIf you feel bad because you don't look like some celebrity, don't.  Their body is their business, in that it literally gives them a paycheck.  They're in top form because that's what puts food on their table.  I don't look like J Lo but I'd bet money I could still drag a 220-pound male wearing 60 pounds of combat gear out of the line of fire, because I trained for things like that and because I know what adrenaline can do for me.  That's what my job requires me to do.  I don't need a six-pack to do that, and I don't have one. \n\nIf you're able to slay your own dragons every day with the body you've got, then you've got the body you need.  Feel bad for J Lo, because she probably can't eat a pizza without feeling guilty, and you can.  There's a tradeoff to everything.",

There is space for J-Lo's artistry, sexuality and athleticism, and the diverse talents of the rest of femalekind.

Of COURSE neither of us look as we did then, but we're not doin' bad. Another truth is that those such as J-Lo and George Clooney do what they do--and that involves looking their pluperfect best--for a living! for heaven's sake. All that said, to my mind, the only reason to not keep looking your best as you navigate the years--becoming 'better seasoned'--is insufficient self esteem. A certain amount of ego is necessary, always, in several aspects of life and while it seems just fine to recognize that as regards the workplace--god forbid you're pushed around!--it seems somehow outre to engage your ego with regard to how you look and even interact. In sum, being the best person you're capable of, both for yourself and others. For me, its keeping trim without being obsessive about it, as well as learning French and Italian. Fries? Great, but not the whole serving. An attractive external and internal self are both legitimate objectives, and we should embrace them, never forgetting the words of that great San Francisco sage Harry Callahan--\"...a man's gotta know his limitations\". Works well for women also.",

Beyonce, J. Lo, and Taylor Swift, have sadly become more about the flesh, than about anything relevant to add to society in general, and the female in particular.  No, I am not a prude, or religious, at all, etc.  I was working in finance in New York City at the age of 20, and I wouldn't of learned anything if all I had was my body back then.  Everyone looks better at a younger age.   I did, but as you age, and I am now 71,  your body changes, especially through having children for most women, and menopause as well.  If you wonder why most men only look at, and talk about females as only bodies, it is because too many clueless females continue to put that out there.  It is people like Adele, and others that don't have to look like a stripper to prove to the world that they have talent, can sing, etc.  The others, not so much.",

Female celebrities and entertainers (and it's not limited to this), even when they seemingly have talents other than being beautiful, are glammed up to as high a level of \"attractiveness\" as can possibly be achieved. This extends to female athletes too, just look at gymnastics. Looks are made to be at least the first or second most important thing about a woman in the spotlight, whereas men usually get to stay comfortably covered enough so you actually notice what they're doing instead -- or at least they're spared the plastic surgery, fake hair, fake nails, fake eyelashes, the cartoonish makeup. It's fine to strive to meet that beauty standard, and many women achieve it somewhat, but it's frustrating that we're not enough without the veneers, all the covering up and fake parts. Even knowing that what you're seeing is a costume, it's impossible to escape the anxiety of not looking like that. The most common compliment an \"attractive\" women of a certain age receives is something along the lines of \"you look way younger\" or \"you look great for your age\" -- why does it always have be in terms of how well we defy reality? I bet JLo looks great underneath all the work, but I also bet she looks a lot more like a 50 year old woman.",

Let's just forget that J Lo was performing;  Jennifer Lopez can be who she wants to be, dress how she wants to dress, etc.,. because  we should be living in a feminist society, a society that doesn't label women as wife, mother, angel, witch, etc.,  but sees a woman as a person. I am so tired of some women judging other women by how they should look.   And, I have read two of Weiner's novels, and didn't like them. Why? Because her main female characters did what Weiner is doing here: ripping up other women who don't conform to some specific \"womanly\" standard.  Instead of dissing Jennifer Lopez's body, be impressed that she is strong, sexy, and put on one great show. She made a political statement in regards to feminism, be strong young multi-ethnic  women of America, (her own daughter was in the show, a tween) and in regards to Puerto Rico, be proud of being Puerto Rican. And, stop putting kids in cages. It was a gutsy show, and as  a Puerto Rican American, I was very proud. Weiner has issues with her own body, but she shouldn't take it out on J Lo. Instead, hit the gym or just accept that some people look better than others and who cares? Appreciate the energy, the talent,  the beauty, and the political statement of Lopez's show.",

They are saying we must strip to be successful, we must display ourselves to get attention. I am no where near a prude, but I dislike this type of message. These women are proud of their bodies, I get that. Maybe they are trying to say that they can be both powerful, intelligent and sexy at the same time. But they are just giving in to the same old stereotypes. At least on TV, networks I'm talking to you - let's not display this.

Perhaps we should be examining why, in the US, we are so scared of women embracing this authentic power and more comfortable in a victim mindset.  That seems to be an avenue for a much more important conversation. The \"backlash\" simply connotes our ignorance as to what sexual energy is and how to use it productively.

Typical middle-age mom stuff.\"\n\nMen don't do things like this.\n\nAnother case in point: NYT movie critic Manohla Dargis's article \"Brad Pitt and the Beauty Trap\", <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/movies/brad-pitt-oscar.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/movies/brad-pitt-oscar.html</a>.\n\nBrad is a fabulous-looking guy who turns 57 this year. I am a few months older and don't look anything like him as do millions of other men. Yet, men aren't writing essays on the age-defying genetics of Brad or his buddy soon-to-be 59 George Clooney. We don't care what they look like and do not feel a need to look like them or judge each other like that.\n\nAlso, women may think we males are obsessed with beauty and youth, but, with the exception of immature men like Trump, we grow out of that quickly and do value women for who they are instead of what they look like.\n\nSo, women, please don't worry about what JLo or Shakira look like or compare yourself to them. We men don't care.\n\nInstead, DO worry about the pornfest being seen by our kids during Super Bowl halftime shows. The NFL should be ashamed.",

As for the sexualization, it was dancing, much of it in Latin styles, almost all of which originate in pelvic movement and torso gyrations. (You know, similar to stuff Elvis stole from black performers previously.) It's not so much sexual as rhythmic. I dunno. I thought they put on an awesome show, sang live, tossed in some subtle and important politics and looked like they were having a blast. And JLo, doing that at 50, was amazing.

On the other hand, you praise Lizzo in an earlier piece but skewer J-Lo -- they *both* sport skimpy costumes showing lots of skin and cleavage and leg, are highly coiffed and made-up.  Why do women feel dehumanized when JLo is on stage but feel empowered watching Lizzo?  If watching JLo perform makes you feel bad, then don't watch her -- watch Lizzo videos instead.  If we surround ourselves with the things that make us feel good and sexy and empowered, we can make peace with how our bodies look.  Yes, we are bombarded with messages of thinness and beauty, but we are all personally responsible for how we respond to it.  True empowerment comes when we take control of our body image and stop allowing celebrities and popular culture to dictate how we feel.",

(Are my college students more comfortable in yoga pants and crop tops?  The epidemic of depression and anxiety in their cohort would suggest it's at least not helping.)  And your use of the term \"pearl clutchers\" to describe women who found the Super Bowl show pornographic clearly shows that you judge that opinion to be Victorian hyper-ventilation. The idea that flaunting one's sexuality constitutes empowerment is a CON: it is just a retooling of the old power-behind-the-throne con, that we can flutter our eyelashes and get men to do what we want.

And, since evolutionary adaptations change according to their environment, we are living in an era where Vogue magazine has been ultimate arbiter of the female ideal for decades. As to any consolation or juicy schadenfreude, this also ensures that JLo is equally miserable about her body, since it has been criticized for being too short, too fat, and too \"ethnic.\" We only need to look back at the year 2000, when Cindy Crawford, supermodel extraordinaire, said this about Jennifer Lopez: \"If I had a b**t that big, I'd never leave the house.\"  And on that note - la lucha continua!",

We'd probably ridicule them. \n\nAnd as for JLo's outfit, there was a large amount of complaining last year about the double standard between Levine and Jackson, who was fined $500,000 for exposing the same parts of her body. If it was okay for him, people said it should be ok for her, and they put that double standard to the test again this year. The outfits can be read as female empowerment, and female empowerment can feel challenging because it is.\n\nBut the bottom line is if you are constantly getting articles on celebrities' looks or a social media feed of fighting over the subject, you are doing that to yourself.

She was built like the proverbial brick you-know-what house, danced like an Amazonian on speed, and belted out tunes that would make both lovers of Motown and lovers of metal cry with joy.\n\nAnd here's what I've concluded:  these women not only take a professional approach to their singing, choreography, and staging, but they also take a professional approach to their bodies:  personal chefs, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, hair & make-up stylists, fashion consultants, and trainers.  They get paid handsomely for what they do, AND they pay out huge sums of money to keep their bodies ogle-worthy.  Think of it this way:  the NFL teams that competed in the Super Bowl have an army of coaches, trainers, nutritionists, etc.  J Lo and Shakira have a similar entourage; they just pay for it as a cost of being who they are.  It's WORK, people!  \n\nIn any event, to try to compare oneself as an average working stiff with kids you are raising without the help of nannies is a fool's errand.  Even if you a dedicated health and exercise enthusiast, it's just not the same.\n\nSo, yes.  Enjoy it for the spectacle it is; don't think for one moment the mere mortal can achieve the same.",

And btw, a woman can be seen as attractive, and even 'sexy', without dressing/carrying on in that way.\n\nAs for women as a whole feeling the need to 'keep up' with certain standards, and the ever-higher bar some women believe we are held to, it behooves us all to remember that... anyone with a brain understands full well the difference between reality and fantasy.  The J Lo show is the latter.  Professional hair and makeup.  Personal trainer and personal chef/dietician.  Then there's all the 'distraction' aspects...her outfit...the dozens of other dancers...the lights.  Sure, J Lo may have been blessed with good genes, but all the aforementioned sure does help as well.\n\nHetero women need to stop comparing themselves to others and wasting so much money/energy to try and 'look younger'.  Just be the best version of YOU that you can be, regardless of age.  There's nothing more Unattractive than self-loathing ('why bother trying anymore?') and an air of desperation (i.e., obvious 'procedures' all over your face).

Also, women of a previous generation (a la Golden Girls) aged more quickly for other reasons and it was convenient to portray them as old ladies when they weren\u2019t really.

And though in outward matters this meant ridicule, poverty, enslavement, etc..., the ironic truth was that being oppressed resulted in a kind of blessing: they benefited inwardly, learning through suffering, and you could say, becoming more beautiful inwardly.\n\nBut humans have advanced to the peak of superficiality in our age, and now those formerly oppressed are getting their chance at power and glory. But at what cost? At the cost of being plastic, superficial, meaningless, and worst of all, blindness to ones own condition.\n\nJesus said, \"Blessed are the poor\", \"He who seeks to save his life will lose it\"\n\nBut let's face it, most today can't even conceive of what He was talking about.

Don't get me wrong, she is a force of nature and an amazing performer. She goes for it every time she is on stage and I give her tons of personal credit.\n\nNobody should even begin to compare themselves to Jennifer Lopez until they can muster the same level of support she has. $40 million a year and a $400 million net worth can get you a lot of time with your trainer. A full-time job plus commute, a couple of kids, soccer practice, piano lessons, an escaped hamster and you're out of milk, good luck finding time to read this article in the Times let alone get to the gym a couple of days a week.\n\nCut yourselves some slack, it is not just between you and L-Lo.",

As others have commented we have the contemporary politics, the possible pandemic, the world burning up, refugees surging at borders and drowning in oceans and small children in cages for more than a year to worry about. And add your own concerns. \nEven J Lo will probably grow older and have arthritis and thinning hair and some lines. Until then it is fine for her to celebrate her beauty and entertain millions.\nThe rest of us will have to age gracefully a bit sooner. I am glad that I had my babies when one could still wear diaphanous cotton.  I'm a teacher though and see high school girls made miserable and anxious by the emphasis on the \" smoking hot female body \" in those kinds of outfits. When we hope they can be thinking about achieving some kind of balance in achievement, hard work, healthy habits and supportive relationships they are real focused on the glitz, glamour, and attaining that kind of look. That worries me much more than how it makes women over 50 feel. Because we are old enough to have some perspective.",

My guess is that, if one asks Mr. Netanyahu that very question, his answer may be something along the following lines: \n\n\"Israel will not allow its security and well-being of its citizens to be left at the mercy of others.  Not having access to Nile's water is an existential threat to Israel's survival. We have no choice but to maintain this corridor. \"\n\nIf not convinced, one needs to remember that Israel has used  the same argument for maintaining its occupation of the Golan Heights. \n\nSorry, I understand it is now called: Trump Heights!",

So this argument comes at an odd time when the Kineret is the fullest in memory. \n\nNevertheless, the issue of water is very real and the issue of infrastructure in the Palestinian Territories is also real. \n\nIt is easier/cheaper to work around the infrastructure problems than solve the people issues that aggravate them. Israel is at the cutting edge of water technology - desalinating from the Med Sea and extracting water from the air and using drip irrigation for agriculture. This just means that scarcity of water is priced into the Zionist project. \n\nThe real issue that Friedman had put his finger on is Arab infrastructure. Since Oslo, Israel has ceased to maintain much of it as it was transferred to the PA. Unsurprisingly, it is deteriorating and will eventually lead to serious issues in the WB.\n\n\nOne would hope that with $50B, peace, and the dismantling of militias some form of semi-competent governance would emerge. But I wouldn\u2019t bet the farm on it. \n\nIsrael\u2019s redrawing of the political map and normalization of ties with its neighbors is a viable route for it to exist without absorbing a hostile population.\n\nIn any case, changing who lives in the WB will not impact rainfall or water flow from Lebanon. \n\n\nThe basic problem is that Israel is an ultra modern society and the Palestinians are something else ruled by a gang of criminals with little concern for their public\u2019s good.",

            "comment_body": "Twenty years ago during the failed Clinton-era peace effort I took the time to find & read the 1947 UN Partition Plan. I was stunned by the authors' vision of regional cooperation on economic development and infrastructure. IIRC, water-resource management was paramount, as was expanding a trans-national regional railway network. Sure, the proposed boundaries of Israel were unrealistic and militarily indefensible. Sure, no one was willing to accept a United Jerusalem as an International Open City. Sure, the 22 members of the Arab League were not going to accept Jewish sovereignty over even one square-inch of Mandate Palestine. And for sure no one could have anticipated the population explosion in the area.\n\nToday, the only thing more stunning that the visionary nature of the Partition Plan is the myopia of too many people today. I count among my friends & acquaintances many who are ardently pro-Israel. But _none_ has ever read the 1947 UN Partition Plan.\n\nThree-quarters of a century make the goals and aspirations of that document no less visionary, no less pertinent. The \"Sun and Sea Initiative\" described by Mr. Friedman represents a much-needed update.\n\nInstead what we saw last week was a scrawny prospectus for Trump Towers in Hebron and Bethlehem, because, y'all know, the Palestinians have nothing to offer besides tourism destinations. Rather like land-locked cruise ships, those towers will probably dump untreated sewage; call it progress. They're such ingrates to say no.",

The boundary line in the area was very fuzzy even before 1967. These local farmers had a habit of breaking the nearby Israeli sewage pipes in order to irrigate their fields. Cheaper. Faster. Of course before the Israelis attempted to deal with sewage they irrigated in time-trusted old-fashioned ways.\n\nThe produce was marketed to both Arab and Jew, sold to wholesalers who sold it on.\n\nEcology does respect borders, boundary lines and walls. It is a matter of perspective and priorities.\n\nIt was not one for those who saw a quick way to save money by irrigating with sewage. \n\nJust as an aside Mr. Friedman, using 2018 statistics is not a good idea.

And that, dear Mother Nature, is the only way peace will come to the land of the former Palestine Mandate.\n\nOnce the Arab leaders accept that their announcedly genocidal wars (1947-8, 1967) have been lost and will not be allowed to occur again, there will be peace.  Indeed, the Trump plan requires the Arab leaders to stop funding murders of Israelis, which they have resisted mightily for many decades.\n\nAs for prosperity, that will follow peace.  Where Arabs are not hounded by their leadership, they get along quite well with non-Arab Israelis, despite the unending anti-Semitic propaganda from government, schools, mosques and media (the elimination of which propaganda, by the way, is also a part of the Trump plan).\n\nSo you see, Mother Nature, you are quite right to cite to WWII as an example to be followed, but you somehow missed the significance of what ended that war and led to peace and prosperity.",

While I appreciate this refreshingly broad view of the situation in the Middle East, it also points out an even larger truth. Nowhere on this isolated planet can any of us go to escape the actions and inactions, the deeds and misdeeds, of ourselves and our fellow humans. Regardless of wealth, status, and power differential, each one of us depends on the same sunlight, the same soil, the same breathable air, the same oceans, rivers, and lakes, the same rain and snowfall, and the same resources for our very lives, both for our survival and for our daily living. \n\nWhile wealth, power, and perhaps location will offer some of us a longer run than others, eventually the same fate awaits us all. It remains to be seen whether humans are the ultimate sentient organism we believe ourselves to be or whether we will prove to be a failed species that will eventually die out to make room for further evolutionary possibilities on our planet. Should we care about which it turns out to be? Perhaps, but at least at the present moment, it appears that greed, power, and political oneupmanship are much more intriguing pastimes than observing the future that is coming into view before us and attempting to work together to change it.",

Unfortunately, current data doesn\u2019t recognize the reality that the environment is dynamic, not static, and is constantly changing.  Human population rates are increasing, and rainfall amounts are declining. Israel is getting richer, and Palestinians are getting poorer.\n\nYou did mention that the Mediterranean was an unlimited source of seawater, but failed to note that the desalinization process includes the discharge of massive amounts of water that contain high saline levels, which will negatively impact receiving water bodies. You also mentioned that the potential for solar power generation was significant, but failed to mention that the cost to produce desalinated water is exponentially higher. A landscape that is increasingly being used for human habitation exacerbates the ability to naturally recharge aquifers and limits space to locate photovoltaic display fields.\n\nIt appears to me that human population growth in the Mid-East is the great unknown, which can quickly outpace the ability to produce potable and affordable drinking water.",

And nothing short of the Israelis and the Palestinians teetering on the edge of collective suicide will awaken the world. Or will it? Nobody knows, for we are off and away into the grim future, and no model has predictive value.

We need to start making certain that all parties to ME political disputes have enough to eat. Having enough to eat means having enough water for growing food and enough water to drink. THE ME IS A DESERT. One of the great resources of the ME is the Mediterranean. It is quite foolish to use the Med as a sewer. The child who was assigned the job of bringing peace needs to think regionally. The first problem to address, in multiples, is sewage and other human waste. Regional thinking would mean meeting the needs of Israel, Jordan, Gaza, and Syria. The next problem is potable water supply in the form of desalination. Then we need to build parallel yet integrated durable electrical grids to supply the desalination plants. While we're at it, we should also build factories to produce solar panels. So, now we have a plan to provide everyone in the ME with 24/7 supplies of electricity, water, and waste removal. This will inadvertently create a lot of jobs for a lot of people in electricity generation and distribution, water generation and distribution, and agricultural products. That's enough for now. Maybe in another decade or two we can talk politics.",

On that subject, there is plenty of innuendo but next to no facts.\n\nTo prove the point, the writer needs to demonstrate a motive for pervasive police wrongdoing.   Presumably, the  motive arises from incentives and rewards for bad identifications by the police.  Surely, we're talking about quotas for arrests that enhance an officer's standing.  So the claim is that the police force is rewarding false arrests of non-gang graffiti artists and those who are undocumented.  \n\nTo believe this claim, you have to believe that this is a widespread and intentional practice--that police officers are sufficiently rewarded for false arrests to break the law day in and day out.   If that is true, the police are corrupt through and through, of course.  \n\nHowever, you pretty much have to be a police hater to believe that they continually make groundless arrests without blinking an eye.

One giant gaping hole in data collection is gun ownership and gun violence but that's a conversation for another time.\n\nThe problem of course with gang membership or any other category is always two-fold though. 1) Accountability. 2) Incentives. Wherever you find an imbalance in the ratio between the two, you'll find abuse of power and injustice.\n\nPolice departments tie advancement to criminal convictions. No patrol officer is making captain holding a stop sign at the crosswalk. You need collars in order to advance. The more serious, the better. There's your incentive.\n\nYou combine that with low accountability. The police officer recording the chit, although legally liable for accurate information, is:1) Not regularly scrutinized. 2) Regularly assumed to have good character. And 3) Supported by other motivated officers engaged in similar illegal behavior.\n\nAnytime we suggest greater accountability though, the police inevitably argue they can't have officers looking over their shoulders' for a lawsuit every time they approach a suspect. Hence, the system perpetuates.\n\nWhat we need then is a change in incentives. We're tracking the wrong metric. We should reward officers for the absence of crime, not the presence of crime. Find the balance between the two and you'll find a solution.",

Unless someone is trying to be obvious about signaling they are in a gang, it's not at all easy to accurately identify who is in a gang and who is not by looking at someone. One of my friends was mistaken for a gang member by an actual gang member, due to a shirt he was wearing. We need to have something more than clothing or accessories to base gang affliation on.",

However, although I disagree at times with the extent of his proposals, free college for the children of the prosperous I think is unjustified, we'll be more likely to get free college for the poor and working class, if the Republican Senate has to deal with a President Sanders rather than President Biden.  It seems unwise to target private health insurance at this time, but sadly I don't see President Biden or President Buttegeig doing much of anything to curtail the ill-gotten riches of the healthcare industry which is a very real problem for all Americans.   We'll also more likely begin to roll back some of the obscene inequality in our country with a President Sanders.  That said, I think this is a tempest in a teapot.  Mr. Sanders has almost no chance of being the candidate of the Democratic Party.   I just hope he and his followers can help it become the party it was for a short while, when it was the party that fought for the poor and downtrodden and not the neo-liberal wind of Wall Street and the Chamber of Commerce.",

No progressive will be able to get more than a percentage of his/her agenda passed, given the current composition of Congress; Paul Krugman wrote about this not long ago.\n\n4. What's the worst that will happen to the centrists under a progressive president? Their tax cuts will be reversed. Boo hoo. But another four years of djt will result in an unrecognizable and rights-stripping judiciary, few environmental protections, continued inaction on the climate crisis, and a continued increase of the American underclass. Bedlam, in short.\n\nCentrists, just stop. Stop. Stop selling out 300,000,000 other Americans, and stop jeopardizing democracy itself, because you're afraid that a fair tax rate will make your take-home a little less obscenely massive.",

It starts with declaring Bernie Sanders an unambiguous winner (the author uses the actual word \"winner\"), without even waiting for the full results to be announced. These are very partial results! There's nothing so far to indicate that the 62% of precincts results published so far are necessarily representative of the complete results! Not to mention that it's Pete Buttigieg who so far appears to be as much of, or more of a winner than Bernie. \nOK, you just like Bernie Sanders, you want him to win, and you want everybody to accept that he should win. It's just hypocritical and silly to phrase this as some kind of a logical conclusion that follows from the results of this messed-up process that's utterly non-representative and convoluted to start with.",

The same is true for the centrists who will face a formidable challenge from Bloomberg. But the numbers do not in fact bode well enough for Sanders.\n\nSecond, the Iowa Caucuses are not an ideal barometer of how most registered Democrats lean. It is a voting system in which you must show up to participate and I imagine that the low turnout favors the evangelized supporter's choice. I doubt that Sanders or Buttigieg are more favored than Biden. Further primaries will most likely prove me right.\n\nI think the most troubling issue for Sanders is the strong showing from Buttigieg. Who would have thought of that? \n\nWhat struck me most was that Buttigieg and his team knew the numbers so clearly all the while the Iowa DNC couldn't post caucus results. Mayor Pete has a ground game that betters Sanders. They were monitoring 70% of the state's caucuses (some 1100 precincts) while Sander's team was basing their best guess on monitoring results in just about 25% of the precincts.  \n\nThis leads me to believe that Sanders is being outwitted by the young rabble-rouser and has yet to come up against a more formidable challenge from the likes of Bloomberg.",

To adhere to these conventions he, his staff and his followers will have to inspire and work with others. If he is sincere in wanting to make the transition from oration to effective governing, he should start showing signs that he recognizes he is not running to be king. I know it's primary season, but it's not too early. Trump ran for president as a vanity project and seemed as surprised as anyone when so many people mistook him for an actual candidate. If Bernie's persistence is not a similar vanity project; if he truly believes he can govern this country as president, he needs to start showing us, now, what that would look like.",

We were beyond disgusted that they did not care who the majority of our state delegates wanted. It was eye opening and infuriating.  We saw the process unfold that assured the HRC nomination.  And we both voted for HRC in the presidential election, but it was difficult.  Now, it is  looking very suspicious that the Iowa caucus results are not being release after 2 days.  If the DNC does the same thing to Bernie Sanders that they did in 2016, we are likely assured another trump victory.  The country cannot survive another 4 years of trump. Bernie Sanders key contributors are American citizens.  Mayor Pete, Biden and the rest are supported by corporate America.  Who do you think has your best interests at heart?",

The truth is that if a President Bernie Sanders gets his agenda enacted as he envisions it, you will see capitalism snap back to popularity just as it did last time out in the 1980s, with the attendant backlash and further social damage. This is because capitalism works well at producing wealth, on national and transnational scales. Few facts are by now better or more irrefutably established than this. What is currently derided as the \"Democratic establishment,\" or \"center-left\" is nothing more than people who recognize this fact.\n\nIf your car lists to the right when you let go of the steering wheel, you get an alignment. You don't burn the car and start over. Concentration of wealth is a problem of capitalism run amuck, not its complete refutation. Sanders' ideas are morally beautiful, his ends are just and good ends.

That challenge is gaining support because the actual center of the party is far to the left of the party establishment. \"65 percent of Democrats feel either somewhat or very positively about socialism.\" Re-read this article substituting right wing for every mention of center, and it makes a lot more sense. There is indeed a struggle between the left wing, backing Sanders, and the right wing, backing Biden and preparing to switch to Bloomberg.

Bernie's appeal is that he doesn't give off this vibe and refuses to play the establishment game.  But it also may be true that temperamentally Bernie CAN'T play this game, which makes him just a leftist version of Trump.",

The present exhibits the same frustration displayed in 2016; the split now between the sum of left candidates and the sum of center-left candidates is virtually the same now as it was then between Sanders and Clinton.\n\nSanders is probably too far left to win the EC, even against an unpopular abject nutjob like Trump. More critical however is the fact that he has no record of meaningful accomplishment and is likely to continue to be ineffective at actually governing, which will matter to people who will decide the outcome in the pivotal States .\n\nThe focus should be on defeating Trump to restore the republic, and the best way to do that is to nominate someone not establishment but also not too far to the left and who is inspiring and exudes leadership. Sadly, this is where the current Democratic field is lacking. \n\nIMHO, Bloomberg, Klobuchar, and Buttigieg would be formidable general election candidates, and Warren could be too if she stops trying to 'out-left' Sanders.

Yes, there are still people that call progressive democrats \"communists\" or \"socialists.\" I hear it all the time in the hot tub at the YMCA in Glenville, NY where I visit every day.  Bernie is no different than many other progressives. Why he chooses to alienate moderate democrats makes no sense to me.

Unfortunately, there is no moderate candidate that has captured the party's imagination.  Biden has only active support among black voters and older voters.  Mayor Pete is young and has yet to capture any strong support among minorities.  Amy also.   Bloomberg is hoping for a brokered convention that turns to him instead of the weakening Biden.  It is the weakness of the moderates, combined with the rabid enthusiasm of his own supporters, which is pushing Sanders to the front of the pack.

Morgan - a unique form of American Socialism. Since 2007, The Federal Reserve has literally funneled Trillions of dollars of free money directly to Wall Street Banks, Investment Funds and as (effectively) interest free loans to Corporate America. This largess has funded billions in CEO payoffs, stock buybacks and subsidized 'earnings'. Congress has provided 100's of Billions in special tax breaks and subsidies for the sole benefit of the same Wall Street and Corporate wealthy elite  who are the primary funders of both political parties. The distribution of wealth among Americans has never been so distorted. The top one percent of income distribution holds over $25 trillion in wealth, which exceeds the wealth of the bottom 80 percent. That is more than all the goods and services produced in the U.S. economy in 2018. I suspect this wealthy minority who so dramatically benefit from 'Silver Spoon Socialism' are increasingly fearful their socialist largess might be shared with the majority of Americans.",

They both won.\n\nWith the middle class nearly extinct, and almost half of adults making an average of just over $10 per hour (no path to the middle class), voters want change.  Their desires are inchoate, contradictory, and ideologically all over the map, but ideology isn't the key anymore.  Voters will elect a candidate who they trust to take on the elite---even if they disagree with them on many issues, or find their personal quirks to be less than perfect.\n\nPundits tell us that moving towards the \"center\" is what wins.  The \"center\" is mostly in the imagination of these pundits.  Ask former Presidents Mondale, Dukakis, Gore, or Hillary Clinton how well that worked for them. \n\nSanders is popular because he's trusted to take on the establishment.  That's what it takes to win.",

Caucus elections disfavors those who have jobs in the evenings or childcare responsibilities or who have illnesses etc. And of course, Sanders promises free tuition and free healthcare to a student population that is concerned about both. Further, Iowa is not representative of the population as a whole, nor especially of the Democratic Party. His doing well in Iowa or in New Hampshire are not necessarily foreshadows of how he would do in the general elections. The Democratic Party has a right to be cautious. He was not vetted in the 2016 primary and there has been fewer attacks on him from Republicans, because they would love to see him as the candidate to run against Trump. The efforts to get Ukraine to announce investigations of Biden and the current Republican threats to open such investigations in the U.S. are because Trump fears that Biden is the one who could most likely beat him.

But it's happening again. Grace and fairness are not much on display in the Democratic establishment's opposition to Sanders.\n\nBut perhaps, in politics, grace and fairness should not always be the first considerations. When democracy is in danger, the need is to win. In this respect the establishment argument against Sanders might be stronger if Kerry had managed to defeat a vulnerable Bush in 2004, or if Clinton had got it done against an appalling Trump in 2016. It's not clear the establishment is right to oppose Sanders, even from the standpoint of electability.\n\nThat said, I think Democrats would do better in 2020 with a moderate candidate. The establishment seems to favor Biden. But his fundraising, his crowds, and his results in Iowa suggest that he might not have the juice. \n\nIf you want to win, you need a candidate who excites people. But as they they were in 2004 and 2016, and arguably in 2008 against Obama, the party establishment is fixated on a \"safe\" candidate who doesn't excite. Their record is not very good. Maybe it's best, then, to keep the fingers off the scale and just let the process unfold.",

He has run for the presidency 3 times, and hasn't yet won a single caucus or primary.  Just look at the NY Times donor maps too for the Dems, where Sanders underperforms the field in big media markets of DC and NYC, while dominating pretty much everywhere else, and it gives a pretty good indication of just how much of a bubble the elite media discourse tends to operate in (with a few welcome exceptions).

One can spend the time till November trying to re-educate them, or one can spend it listening to them. They may well confirm that they like any number of progressive policies and yet find Sanders and his Bros too much in their faces.\n\nIf young voters who demand Sanders as the nominee don't get him, the upshot may be that traditionally unmotivated young voters turn out to be unmotivated after all. That's roughly a wash. The greater risk is putting off traditionally motivated older (Democratic and independent) voters.\n\nBernie Sanders speaks of \"taking on the entire establishment.\" That's his mindset in a nutshell, and it goes beyond powerful interests. Bernie's worldview is \"me against the rest\". The more you learn about him, the more you realize what a porcupine he is. Where other people in public life try to build alliances and cultivate sympathies, Sanders says, in effect, \"Don't try agreeing with me. You're part of the problem I'm out to solve.\" He's even that way with the mainstream news media, which any responsible politician today ought to value as a lifeline of democracy.\n\nIf the progressive message is ever to get through, the messenger mustn't be a poison pill.",

Do they think he will have the stamina to duke it out daily for months against the Trump/GOP slime machine?\n\nAt the very least, with his recent heart attack, if Sanders is the nominee, he needs to have an A-plus level running mate (under 70 for sure, and preferably under 60) who can appeal to the majority of Democrats and who can seamlessly slide into the oval office if Sanders wins but the inevitable end comes before his term is up.

Bernie calls himself a Socialist, and has a long history of expressions of approval and support for Communist regimes (Nicaragua, Cuba, USSR).  I don't think that someone like that can win an Electoral College victory in 2020. It doesn't matter that Bernie isn't proposing Communism or Socialism for the USA, since very few voters will ever look deeply enough into all this to make these distinctions.

So these oligarchs will do anything necessary, including deliberately stealing the nomination from Bernie by any means necessary, up to and including at the convention. It will be just fine with the oligarchs if the Bernie fans then sit out the election and guarantee Trump's, and all the American oligarchs' victory and continued control of our politics in both parties. Progressives either take over the Democratic Party, or they are absolutely helpless going forward, no matter how much progressive Millennials in, say, 2028 outnumber the largely dead conservative Boomers then. Because if the progressives can't take over the Democratic Party, they'd have to create a new party which would split the former Democrats in two and guarantee one-party oligarchical rule for the rich by the Republicans virtually forever.

Is any voter who even dreams of retirement in a decade or two willing to risk it all on Socialism?\n\nThe GOP will hone in on these voters, and the Democrats will split down the middle.

I remember thinking, \"Wow--she's so openly contemptuous of Sanders--is the head of the DNC supposed to be so transparently biased at this stage of the game?\"\nSo of course I went on to look more closely at Senator Sanders, and found a great deal to admire. I'd found my candidate. And I, like so many others, became enraged at the DNC's blatant favoritism.\nAnd here we go again. Yes, I am without doubt an (almost) anyone-but-Trump voter this time around, but this piece just reminded me that I should make a contribution to Sanders' campaign. (As I said in another comment on a different article, the mere fact that he was and is the only candidate who doesn't feel that he needs to drink the Netanyahu Kool-Aid just to stay in the running makes me respect him all the more. And, as I also mentioned in that comment, the fact that he is Jewish kind of negates the whole \"anti-semitic\" argument that some might try to toss my way.)\nI am, by the way, a 58-year-old woman, so I don't think I can be accused of being a \"Bernie bro\" either.\nIt would just be nice to have someone for whom I have real respect as president again.

In particular, the wealth tax seems a bit extreme.  Sanders suggested a rate of about 8%, which would confiscate the wealth of billionaires over time.  There is a possible problem with constitutionality, and it might be difficult to get such a tax passed in Congress, but the real question is whether it is a good idea.\n\nSanders wants to use the health tax to fund universal health care.  But you can't just cash in the stocks of billionaires and immediately provide health care to more people.  You need a plan which includes the training of new doctors to provide the health care and that takes time.  It seems to me that we do need a crash program to train more doctors, but even if that is done, it will take a decade for the new doctors to go through the university and medical school, and complete a residency.\n\nThese parts of the plan have not been discussed.\n\nThere are further missing details in many of the issues confronting Democratic candidates.

So-very good, until you come to this paragraph. Please, NYT, your editors & columnists should know (or at least learn) the terminology.\nHere's the faulty paragraph:\nRecent polling from the Pew Foundation shows that, while Republicans are overwhelmingly opposed to socialism, 65 percent of Democrats feel either somewhat or very positively about socialism (55 percent say the same about capitalism.) It may be that socialism is less disturbing to voters on the fence than Mr. Trump\u2019s manifest deficits, or it may be that the label itself has lost some of its Cold War infamy.

Yes, big defeat for Biden but also a big defeat for the liberal/progressives. Consider this, the Sanders/Warren total is ~43% whereas the combine center total of Buttiegig/Biden/Klobuchar was 57% and this in a state where the Democrats are decidedly left-leaning. Not only did Sanders get half the vote that he got in 2016 but his total combined with Warren is ~5% less than he alone got in 2016. Sanders may go on to win New Hampshire, but I can imagine him winning any other primary. Moreover, he has a snowball's chance in Florida of winning PA, Wisconsin, and Michigan in the general election against Trump, and you can't do that you are not going to get enough electoral votes to win the election no matter how votes you roll-up in California. I don't really have a favorite but the Iowa caucus clearly shows that a far left candidate has little chance of winning the nomination and absolutely no chance in the general election. Sorry, passion and zealous doesn't win the the Electoral College.",

And if 53% of the single most popular candidate's backers sit out the general if he is not the nominee (because of the need for a better bet for the swing states), those states will swing behind Trump due to lower Democratic turnout.  Heck, in that situation, Trump might even win the popular vote.\n\nWhen we're no longer looking at national polls (frankly, anyone who does still doesn't understand what happened in 2000 or 2016 [and those who fail at history, well, you know] is an amateur) but polls in swing states ONLY, then we will get an idea who will be taking the oath next January.",

It never even occurred to him that in this atmosphere, those would be automatic disqualifiers for a Democratic candidate; he was concerned about a hit to his income, not the optics.",

So Iowa is not representative of the US and caucus voters are not representative of Iowa. We have heard this hype about Bernie Sanders before. In 2016 he essentially tied Hillary Clinton in Iowa and then defeated her by a large margin in New Hampshire and basically tied her again in Nevada. another caucus state. Sounds like Sanders will be the winner right. Wrong. Reality set in when he faced Clinton in South Carolina and the door virtually closed on his chances on Super Tuesday. Until southern blacks have a chance to vote and people in large metropolitan areas have a chance to vote I am not buying all the Sanders hype.

And the lack of clarity in Iowa gives us a chance to take another look at Mike Bloomberg.\n\nWe should give Bloomberg a chance.  After all, we not only need to choose a candidate but we need to get the issue right, and perhaps debates including Bloomberg can shed light on key issues.\n\nThus Sanders gives a persuasive stump speech.  But some people are afraid that the details might not work.  There is the issue of the wealth tax, which might be unconstitutional and didn't work out well in France.  Debates could clarify this issue.\n\nThere's another murky issue:  Essentially all of the candidates promised to extend health care to illegal immigrants in the first debate.  This was a gotcha question by the media, and nobody actually answered the question in any depth.\n\nHere's the question that the candidates should have been asked:  Do you favor \"open borders\" or do you want to limit immigration, and if so, how much?\n\nI don't think we yet know the answer to that question for any of the candidates.\n\nSo more debates are needed.  In short, we need a reset after Iowa.\n\nAnd the media needs to stop shirking its jobs.\n\nCampaign slogans and superficial thinking elect the worst presidents.  We need a decision process which encourages deeper thinking which leads to realistic conclusions.\n\nThe public needs to be better informed.",

My son called his counselor to talk about courses and was upset (but very polite)  he could not take a course. I was in the room and he was on speaker phone. The counselor asked him if his \"mommy was going to call\"! She did not know I was listening obviously. So that is the attitude!\nYes people pay a lot of money and expect to get what they pay for. And colleges should deliver and stop their constant complaining and hiding behind this stupid (but very self aggrandizing and quite handy) story they tell themselves. \nAnd my son can cook, clean, lives on a budget and all those other things listed undoubtedly by people who don't have children.",

You want to be hands-off as a parent, but serious psychiatric illness is not that uncommon. It\u2019s manageable, with good diagnosis and support.  But un-caught, it can be worse than a heart attack and no less surprising. It often gets going for real in late teens early twenties.  It affects the brilliant and the bemused. Parents are lucky if their first alert is a \u201charmless\u201d interaction with police, or a student in the ER. Not that common, you say - but if not your student, others in their class will suffer this.\n\nColleges are understandably shy to discuss student suicides or \u201cmedical\u201d dropouts. But for parents, these are real nightmare monsters out there for this age group. Sometimes a parent can\u2019t help - especially if a non- minor student doesn\u2019t want them involved. But sometimes early family support can be life-saving, or even just a small raft in a sea of what can feel like a disorienting catastrophe. When a student\u2019s life path takes that kind of turn, staying at college may or may not be in the cards. But can there more than risk, stigma, and liability-anxious institutional silence for them and for their family?",

I instinctively knew, reinforced by reading the \"helicopter\" articles, that they were doing major long term damage to their kids.  So much so that I finally got my daughter away from the whole sordid situation.  The amount of pig headed bullying and screaming at referees, demands that their kid always be playing to the point of MONETARY BRIBES etc. was mind boggling.

Two of those names have been thru drug rehab and are still \"partying\", one flunked out of school and has apparently been abandoned by her formerly helicopter parents and one is flunking junior college and injured a friend when she totalled the new Lexus while drunk  her parents gave her last year .

We were given ample administrative support to do our course preparations, community service, and still work closely with students.  Once state budgets and enrollments began their precipitous declines, faculty support was virtually eliminated while every imaginable entertainment and comfort was offered to attract and keep students. Rather than foster responsibility by enforcing deadlines or limited seats, faculty were advised to be more flexible with due dates, allow re-takes on exams, and basically accept drivel for assignments while minimizing actual criticism of punctuation, grammar, or spelling.  Students sporting expensive tattoos would let us know they couldn't afford their textbooks or paper for printing out assignments.  Working all night to pay for tuition and then sleeping through, or missing class was to be 'worked out.'  Basically, no accountability at all for this new generation of students.",

Considering that young men and women of 18 who do not have money to go to college often end up fighting our wars, I find it shocking that parents would so coddle their children who are similarly aged but socially privileged and emotionally swaddled. Maybe these children should take a few gap years to grow up -- and their parents, too.

College can be behaviorally counter-productive, and the faculty, often very poor role models concerning work, social and even intellectual habits. Behavioral and ideological faculty \"mirroring\" by students can be dysfunctional, resulting from an absence of their own strong personal identity and intellectual independence that largely comes from experience outside college, or at least prior to it.  How many 18 year-old freshman know what it is like to commit to hard physical labor, and have standards of conduct from meaningful, responsible employment?\n\nAs for the writer's recommendations, they're fairly trite, even 'parental' in their tone, while leaving unaddressed many other urgent, and justified concerns.

Even if a course is not specifically 'required,' per se, it can be a pre-requisite for another class, and may be needed to help fulfill distribution requirements.

Of course colleges want to have that advantage over my kids, and over my money.\n\nSorry, but I'm doing everything in my power to help my children, especially when it comes to fighting back against institutions that care FAR more about making money than about making sure my kid is being treated well.",

            "comment_body": "I'm on both sides of this issue. I have a daughter in college and I'm a college administrator. Yes, it's annoying when parents e-mail or call to advocate for their student. I encourage them to ask their young adult to come in and talk to me. I assure the parents that I'll be professional and as helpful as I can be. \n\nThat said, I'm also aware that universities can be a bit cold-hearted when students need help. Long story short, my daughter dented another car by accident and went to look for paper to write a note. In the meanwhile, the car had left and reported the dent to police. Through the police, she resolved the problem and paid for the repair. \n\nSoon, though, the Associate Dean of Students was bringing her up on charges for endangering others and theft of another's property (still not sure how that came about). Needless to say, I did intervene with that Associate Dean and his boss the Dean of Students. As an administrator myself, I couldn't believe the cold bureaucracy at work. \n\nAs far as problems signing up for classes, I agree that the student needs to take the lead, but I do understand a parent's concern. An additional semester at a place like Barnard costs perhaps $40,000. A few semesters of missed courses really adds up. If a parent is paying that kind of bill, they have a right to be a bit proactive.",

Assigning advisors not in the chosen major, enforcing random-seeming rules that didn't take extenuating circumstances into account, and zero follow-up with students are NOT a good prescription for any student, but it's particularly egregious for students with special needs. Parents need to step in when mental health and learning disabilities are not being supported. Dr Friedman should talk with parents who've dealt with their child's suicidal ideation, self-harm, substance abuse, PTSD, mental health issues, or physical health diagnosis. She might learn something about how to SUPPORT families, not judge them.",

However, the example of parents' responses when students don't get into classes they need does not make a strong case against parental interference.

It was rare, if ever, that students couldn't complete the major in time with required classes.  Those good old days are gone.  Now colleges and universities have allowed internal politics to dictate massive gen ed requirements, and departments often don't accept transfer credits for the major.  Students find it difficult to get the classes they are required to take within four years.  Parents are right to be up in arms about students not being able to get into a class.  Taxpayers also should be helicoptering to complain to provosts, deans, directors of parent engagement, et al., since students, funded by Pell grants and loans (that some candidates argue should be forgiven and covered by taxpayers), find it more expensive and difficult to graduate with a degree.",

Your kid will get poor training, and though he may get a good grade, he still won't know how to write an essay or a research paper, which he will need to do in future classes. And then you'll hire me again for the next course because he still can't tackle his research project. (I just met one of them too, in a different college on the west coast.)

That is the University\u2019s job. \n\nMy son is a physics major  - the course director\u2019s job is to determine the requisite courses and to coordinate them so that the level of mathematics required aligns with the physics being taught...and to ensure that these courses are available in a logical sequence. \n\nIt\u2019s easy enough to pontificate, but one should also recognize that universities have become businesses rather than learning institutions.

I spent as much time, if not more, learning how to navigate the college catalog and the course schedule than I did with any class.\n\nI'd learn department hierarchies and establish relationships with the people who signed waivers. The enrollment override waiver is mandatory for on-time graduation. The prerequisite waiver is helpful more generally. The hard part is tracking down signatures. You need to know who is signing the waiver and provide a good explanation as to why they should sign it. See the point about relationships above.\n\nI got to know the registration office very well.\n\nThis attention to bureaucracy allowed me to graduate with two different majors from schools in three different states with a semester abroad, a semester off, a free summer semester, and I almost finished with two minors on top.That's before two college jobs, one as a teaching assistant. I was enrolled in two other schools as well but the course timing unfortunately failed.\n\nIn short: Planning is essential.

We put the credit card in her name (with us as back up with the bank, though she didn\u2019t know that) and did the same with her phone.

The young woman was an International Baccalaureate student. \"She is going to need extra help in college, and special education will provide that,\" the mother insisted. We pointed out it was far too late to start the paperwork for such a reclassification, and  asked why she wanted this. Well, it turned out the mother did all of the young woman's  homework. The mother read the books and wrote the papers. (They weren't that good. The girl never got above a C on any of her written work.) The young woman didn't know how to handle anything like that, because her mother had hijacked her chances to dig in and get things done. Hence, the young woman didn't get past the first semester of college. She couldn't handle it. That mother had done a gross disservice to that child. Life can be tough, but let them live their lives. Indeed, let them have their lives. Be there to advise (if asked) but in the end it is their responsibility and right to figure things out for themselves. I hope that young woman - who is now in her 30's - is doing well. I also hope she can forgive her mother for the smothering.",

When he encounters some problem--unhappy and wanting to transfer; not getting a class he needs; dispute with administrators; yadda yadda--we talk things through with him as much as he desires, but ultimately leave him to work it out. And he does.\n\nThat said, I get why some step in. I look at his tuition vs that of another kid at a public university, and it's hard not to think that my private-college kid shouldn't face things like oversubscribed classes or forced triples. I don't like thinking about it this way, but: You charge that much, don't be surprised when those who pay expect the experience to proceed as advertised.\n\nSecond, intervention works. My son once asked us to intervene regarding a housing request. When I hesitated, he said this is what his friends were doing, and he needed to do it too in order to live in the same house as them next year. He even forwarded (at his friend's urging) an email exchange between the friend's dad and admin, explaining why this housing situation was necessary. I declined to intervene, and indeed my son watched his friends get the preferred housing while he was left to scramble for leftovers. Families learn that parental intervention gets a response. I don't agree with this and remain hands-off, but admins shouldn't complain about parental intervention when they reward it.",

This op ed needs to be taken seriously by parents, who must allow their kids to do badly and make mistakes or be inconvenienced. They need this to build inner resourcefulness. I recently advised a student who will be in college another year because his father registered him for all his classes. The dad ignored his son\u2019s academic program of study that we put together for him, and messed up the prerequisites he needed for his major.

Neither of us are good at math, so we made sure our kids understood the assignment and how to complete the homework assignment before they left school that day, which usually meant going in for extra help during a free period.   We also told them in their sophomore years that we would pay for 4 years of college tuition, to the best college they could get into on their own.  Our belief was that if they were not capable of traversing the admission process on their own, they would not be successful in college.  We never helped them fill out the forms or write their essays.  We took them on college visits they arranged themselves, and other than Swarthmore, insisted they attend in-state public colleges/universities ( they chose Miami and Ohio U.,  as well ) so that we did not go into debt.  Two graduated in four years, and 1 graduated in 3 by going year round to summer school at our local community college.  When he received an Incomplete for one summer course because the computer lab was being updated, even though he spoke with the professor ahead of the class to make sure that portion of the coursework would not be required since he didn't have  a computer . . . he wrote a very articulate 7-page HAND-WRITTEN letter to the president of the college, she agreed with him, and changed his Incomplete to a grade.",

The 2 years of chaos were extremely costly in terms of wasted work time.  But the managers did not care because they did not need to care.

The excess reliance on technology as a remedy for message coherence and/or policy deficiency is going to be with us for the forseeable future but its a mistake and fails as often as it succeeds. Just like this app apparently.\n\nTwo, this app came out of Obama/Hillary world who, 2012  wizardry or no, are the original source of the problem. David Plouffe said last night on MSNBC that he is on the board of Acronym which apparently created Shadow and the hand behind  the whole thing seems to be Hillary's 2016 campaign manager Robbie Mook. But even the idea that Mook et al sold that the Democrats needed digital extra security to keep the integrity of the election safe\u2014from the Russians I guess\u2014seems, I don't know, sketchy. This guys are half grifters, half conspiracy theorists.\n\nAnd then there were the gullible idiots of the Iowa Democratic Party and Tom \"change the rules in the middle of the game\" Perez, who seem to have not taken any basic precautions like trying the thing out first. Hard to see what they were thinking. But you get the feeling it wasn't nothing good.",

(Even as I write that I wince a bit wondering if we can trust the Trump admin on this)  \n\nIowa Dems have a lot to answer for in why they chose to ignore this advice & why they claimed assurances of no hack or intrusion. \n\nHalderman testified before Senate Intelligence Com in June 2017. His team was hired by DC to hack the voting machines to reveal vulnerabilities. They successfully hacked the machines and changed all of the votes. DC knew they were in their system yet could find NO TRACE of the hack and vote changes. \n\nI don't for a minute think foreign adversaries are the only ones tampering with our voting equipment. It's time to get real about what we're up against. McConnell refuses to bring legislation to protect elections to the floor.

In aviation as in e-commerce or democratic elections, foul-ups are harmful, prodigiously expensive, and cannot be tolerated in business or by the public.\n\nThe nature of the Iowa caucus App problem, from what I have so far seen, was probably more in the area of user-interface and user-experience issues. The human-machine interface is super tricky and arguably is an arena of high tech design that presents the most insidious technical challenges. But like any complex state machine, it is made useful and dependable through extensive live testing and no Gee-I-Hope-It-Works well-wishing.\n\nThe question I have for Iowa Democratic officials is what did you do to test it and did you follow the vendor's testing recommendations prior to release?\n\nShort of a Boeing 737 MAX crashing in New Hampshire en route to delivering hardcopy Iowa caucus tallies, I can't think of a worse way for technical glitches to ruin an election.",

By using their main reporting in number, it was too busy for managers to call in their results.\nThe brouhaha over the Iowa caucus management issues got me reading Charlie Warzel today, and though I didn't like his piece, suggesting that this phone mistake indicates the end of the world, I followed a hypertext to his column below on November 1, 2019, about the importance of fighting the Republicans on the internet, with memes, or, folk content, of our own, but also, organized by professionals. He pointed out that the Democrats only spent 15% of their ad budgets on internet ads, while Trump was more like the opposite, but he doesn't give a figure. He wrote: \"The Trump campaign already has a healthy head start building up its microtargeting and fund-raising technology. In the digital ad-spend arms race on Facebook and Google, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has spent more than the top three Democratic candidates combined to identify and turn out supporters in key states and counties. Arguably more important is the data acquisition play. The Trump campaign is building tools to take advantage of information like mobile location data to learn intensely personal details about potential voters and then hit them with explicitly tailored messages that fire them up.\"",

At some sites, the higher threshold for the second round was ignored. At other sites, the higher threshold was used to declare a candidate not viable. My sense is that it is this \u201cirregularity\u201d that\u2019s got the Iowan Democratic Party hunkered down at the law firm.

Donald Trump would likely never have even been nominated under the old methods.  We might have to rephrase the old saw to \"vape filled rooms\" but both parties are too vulnerable to the manipulations of activists and agenda driven people who nominate unelectable and divisive candidates.

Pairing must bring broad demographic appeal, moral and ethical authority, unrivaled competency to lead and manage, and loud commitment to unifying us both domestically and by restoring our global alliances and trustworthiness. In addition, the ticket's policy priorities must include addressing climate change, our collapsing infrastructure, healthcare for all, universal minimum wage of $17 an hour, Congressional term limits to begin reversal of the killing impact of big money on our legislation, jobs, jobs, jobs via government works projects (opportunities abound), and higher pay and accountability standards for our teachers - raise standards and pay them!  There's more but, these are a start and we - USA - can walk and chew gum at the same time.  I suggest for President, Bloomberg & for VP, Deval Patrick, Kamala Harris, or Mitch Landrieu.  Please, suggest other pairings and ditch the pitch Bloomberg is buying the election; every candidate runs on Big money - with Bloomberg, his run makes him accountable only to us.   Let's get Busy!",

A firm tied to Hillary Clinton, herself tied to Biden (as Kerry and Bloomberg, both billionaires, are, at least in spirit) set up an app which conveniently crashed. Hence the fact Biden was severely rejected in Iowa is masked by this delay: Biden doesn't seem to have finished among the top third, and is slugging it out with Senator Klobuchar...\n\nWhat is clear is that Sanders' greatest adversary is not Trump. Oh no. Trump is actually running a strident anti-drug companies advertising, explaining to \"Americans\" that they pay much higher prices than any others around the world for the same exact drugs. The exact sentence used by Trump was used by a progressive such as yours truly, for years. So yes, Trump is a so-called \"populist\", so is Sanders, and the establishment hates them, because they will reduce how much money flows to the greedy elite....\n\nSo, yes, it looks like an accident favoring the established Elite. But conveniently the fact Biden lost is drowned by a talk about an app... How many accidents do we need, before we suspect a conspiracy?",

Reward states that have best predicted the mood of the nation by allowing them to vote on the full range of candidate choices instead of later winnowed choices.      \n3. Give states the incentive to elect ultimate winners who would have the broadest appeal in order to retain their special early & influential primary voting status.      \n4.

As the author clearly states, \"And, it should be said, the administration has not banned all entry from Nigeria \u2014 only applications for permanent residence. Tourists can still visit America, an odd loophole if the White House is actually worried about terrorism.\" Permanent residents are much more thoroughly vetted than tourists. And it is also not about Nigerians overstaying visas. Again, this concerns banning any from applying, legally, for permanent residency. Put this together with a long list of other policies, eg \"public charge rule\"/wealth test which would also limit permanent immigration from predominantly poorer, non-white countries, and you start to see a pattern. Put this together with the history of Stephen Miller, the white nationalist who is the administration's chief architect on immigration policy, and you start to see a rationale. The goal is not to limit brown/black tourists, it is to keep brown/black people from permanent residency and citizenship, because in the minds of Trump/Miller, they make for inferior residents and citizens.",

They contribute immeasurably to US society and culture. How horrible this news is: first, in the message of  racism and xenophobia that hurts them emotionally and socially; second, in the fact that they may not be able to reunite their familes here in the US. \n\nMany immigrant families come here in small \"batches;\" e.g. first a father, then his wife and children after he has become established. This practice is derided by the administration as \"chain migration.\" In fact, it makes a lot of sense, and contributes to their well-being and that of our nation.\n\nA grandma who has no economic value by Stephen Miller's calculations provides child care, housework and meal preparation while Mom and Dad are working second-and third-shift jobs. Little children grow up to become talented members of their schools and churches. People with disabilities are able to access the services and infrastructure that will help them achieve their full potential and contribute to the community. (These examples are drawn from my circle.) \n\nMr. Miller and his cohort, should they visited their aging relatives in a nursing home, could count the number of African immigrants--many with advanced degrees--who patiently change residents' diapers, spoon-fed them, lift them from bed, and patiently listen to them when they are lonely and distressed, for puny wages under tough conditions.",

Part of that special interest was visible last week in Washington, as Jared Kushner's \"Deal of the Century\" was announced concerning the partition of Palestine. The travel ban merely extends from that larger geopolitical objective.

If the risk of terrorism is not a pretext, why doesn\u2019t the U.S. do more to effectively regulate visits and immigration by people from Saudi Arabia, since most of the 911 terrorists, and many other terrorists who have killed people in the U.S. have come from Saudi Arabia, not Nigeria.

The UK has an entire department dedicated to Nigeria for the sole reason of fraud and Australia also has Nigeria alongside Pakistan as one of the nations they manually process data such as education credentials in order to verify them.\nCanada has a high rejection rate of Nigerian visa applicants for the very same reasons, fraud and visa overstays. \nIf it was truly about race, we should be seeing all 55 African nations on that travel ban. Last I checked, South Africa, Seychelles, Botswana, Liberia and Namibia(Nambia to Trump) have low rejection rates .\nNigerians face restrictions even from fellow African nations, with South Africa refusing to give them the  visa on arrival option,even as the country extended the privilege to other commonwealth nations while East African nations like Kenya actually ask Nigerians to be cleared by their drug enforcement agency first before entering their country.\nSo the problem is with Nigerians, not Africans in general. That is not racism.",

The results are unmistakeable.  There is a limit to the carrying capacity of planet earth.  Global warming is a message earth to us, saying we have reached and surpassed carrying capacity.\n\nThe population of Nigeria is growing at 2.6% per year, the population of DR Congo is growing at 3.3% per year.  Population growth is causing use of fossil fuels to rise, even as we TRY to shift to solar and wind energy.\n\nJapan is CHOOSING to build new coal plants which pollute enormously to replace nuclear energy which it used before.  This decision will be replicated by dozens of other countries as the need for energy grows with the growing population.\n\nWe already have had famine in Zimbabwe, genocide in Rwanda, civil war in DR Congo, and slums expanding throughout Africa due to too much population growth.\n\nAnd it is the Africans who will suffer most as the planet warms.",

            "comment_body": "This was a political move purely done to whip up Trump's base.  His base is strongly anti-immigrant, legal or otherwise.  It is rooted in white nationalism.  These people are afraid of white people losing majority status.  They will tell you that they are not racist. They just don't want any nonwhite, non-christian people moving here.  They don't see the contradiction.\n\nThe irony of this position is that rural areas are shrinking because of the loss of young people.  The older the population, the lower the consumption.  The greater the young population, the greater the economic growth.  One of the reasons the left coast regions are prospering is because of steady or increasing populations.\n\nThey fail to understand that economic growth is not a zero sum game.  They view immigration as taking jobs away from them.  But increases in population increase economic growth.  In fact, the prime driver for low global economic expansion has been declining birthrates in the world's industrialized nations.  Two percent growth is now the new normal as a result of these declines.",
