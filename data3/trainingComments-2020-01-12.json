He opposed free trade, neoconservative interventionism, and signing agreements providing no advantages to the US.  That means that there are no \"old hands\" that could aid him.  Cheney and Powell don't agree with his foreign policy ideas, nor do most of the establishment Republicans whom Trump disdains.\n\nJust because you served in prior administrations, publish in Foreign Policy magazine, teach at an Ivy League international affairs department, or attained the rank of general doesn't mean that your views aren't nonsensical and ineffective.  Trump is hated mostly because he has no respect for meaningless credentials, the ultimate currency for influence in DC and on the pages of the NYT.",

He was tremendously hampered by only being Vice President. For example, consider his promotion of the yellowcake forgeries. These were so transparent that an eleven year old of average intelligence with dial-up internet would by following instructions in a children's book on espionage I read in junior high have quickly revealed their falsehood. For example, of those Nigerian officials who supposedly signed the documents (all in the same handwriting) some were at the date of the documents dead and others had not yet taken office. When a former US ambassador to Niger was sent there to see if there was any truth at all in the forgeries, he returned to say there was not. So Cheney orchestrated people in diverse government agencies and in the Republican intelligentsia to get revenge. The ambassadors wife lead a major covert CIA team overseas. To get his revenge, Cheney exposed her and her entire team.",

Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons; they weren't before Trump put the hole in his foot.\n\nThere is a new plan every time Trump sees a new shiny thing or has a discussion with his advisers at Fox.  It won't be the same plan as last week, and there's no likelihood that it will be plan for tomorrow.\n\nCheney?  At least he actually had a plan and stuck with it.  Not a good plan, but a plan nevertheless.\n\nThere seem to be several ways of getting into $T wars.",

Nor should one expect a retraction of last week's reporting of how the termination of Soleimani \"united\" the Iranian people. Clearly millions of Iranians and Iraqis were dancing in their homes to celebrate the death of that mass murderer. But such is the reality of  American mainstream media which provides succor to the  mullahs and retrofits arch terrorist Suleimani  into a statesman. As for today's Times report  about the current anti-government demonstrations (which so fly in the face of last week's report on Iranian unity) the  Gray Lady will not even allow talkbacks. Such is the censorship at the Times. What we get instead is this piece of conjecture about how Trump is no Dick Cheney. We have just witnessed the decisive and long overdue action by Trump which has effectively defanged the Iranians, forced them to show their true colors -- as well as the craven colors of the American mainstream media -- and galvanized the American People. Yet the best the Times can come up with (rather than show the big news of Iranian solidarity with America and Israel, and perhaps offer an editorial apology) is a self-serving op-ed attempting to make a negative comparison between Trump and the once equally reviled Cheney. It seems that journalistically, at least, there is forever a new bottom to scrape in the MSM barrel.",

Mr. Mann makes the same mistake as many others in touting Congressional Republicans' \"loyalty\" to Trump as the reason they follow every disastrous \"foreign policy\" step he's taken. \n\nSo let's say exactly what is going on here. Republicans in Congress need the votes of every single Trump supporter. This one fact drives every single decision they make in supporting this mentally unhinged man. \n\nWhat is missing from the discussion of Trump's \"foreign policy\" is the role of Trump voters. Of course Republicans in Congress toady to Trump. But had Trump voters' support dropped substantially by now, Senate Republicans would be crawling all over themselves to remove him. \n\nSome three years on in the most disastrous presidency of my lifetime (and I remember presidents back to Eisenhower), his voters are still in lockstep with him for only one reason - he is a white nationalist. Congressional Republicans' toadying creates a damning record of the morals, beliefs and values of Trump voters, who are some 40% of the American people. \n\nThat is, they know of Trump's criminal conduct, but they just don't care. They simply want a \"president\" who tells them that as whites, they are the only \"real\" Americans. \n\nThe only thing Trump voters want from their \"president\" is that he hates brown skinned people as much as they do. If he kills brown skinned people overseas, so much the better. And this is the only reason he will remain in office.",

Hence, the question: why? Why did Republicans follow Trump into this hole? Why are they so eager to help the U.S. flip itself on its back? Why are they so willing to go down this path... or is their ignorance and blindness so extreme that they actually don't get what's happening?

If that was the case, they would have not supported invasion of Iraq; instead, they would be pushing for invasion of Saudi Arabia. Even the first year political science students know that the Wahhabi faith - promoted by the Saudis world-wide - has been clashing with western values and has been responsible for creating Al-Qaeda and ISIS.  And it was the Saudi royals who financed the 9/11 terrorist attack on New York. \n\nAnd neither they been unconditionally loyal the president.  Their loyalty is, and has been, to those corporations who fund their election campaigns. Now, it happens that the same corporations and organization (e.g. NRA) are financing both Republicans and Mr. Trump.  That is when the Republicans' message and the president's message coincide and they appear to be solidly supporting him. \n\nAnd let's not go too far is distinguishing Dick Cheney from Donald Trump! Dick Cheney was an oil executive, with a plan to give US companies access to Iraq's oil.  He managed to do that by inventing the story that Saddam Hussein has WMD and getting Bush to invade Iraq. \n\nTrump is similarly after oil of Middle East countries.  But he is too impulsive and too narcissistic to be able to hide his real intent behind plausible stories.  So, he goes on TV and, to make sure that the next day he will be on the front pages, he famously announces: \"we should keep their oil\".",

He appeared with his cardiologist and historian Michael Bechloss.  I spoke to Cheney after the talk.  He was nothing like my impression of him.  During the talk, far from being the omnipotent powerful Dick Cheney, Cheney placed great emphasis on what he had endured with his very serious cardiac problems - he seemed thoughtful, vulnerable and took great pains when talking to Bechloss to make sure he was understood.\n\nSpeaking to him after, Cheney was quiet, polite, softspoken and unprepossessing.\n\nQuite a surprise to me who like many others had imagined Cheney as Darth Vader.  He wasn't.\n\nCheney did many arrogant, destructive, horrible things that ruined a lot of lives.\n\nBut he's just a little man with problems and vulnerabilities like any other.\n\nI've never met Trump.  Never want to.  \n\nA journalist friend in NYC who has known Trump (and some members of his family) since the 1980s told me his summation about Trump for people who ask is that Trump \"is a person with no inner resources.\"\n\nI think Dick Cheney has plenty of inner resources.  He used them for bad ends but he has them.",

Bush2 was handled skillfully by Cheney and friends in fomenting a war that filled out their bank accounts and got whole slew of people killed, and are to this day still being killed. Cheney/Bush people didn't care then, and which is where the Trump thugs have managed to appear as responsible pretenders to the throne.

Remember what happened to low energy Jeb Bush for supporting his brothers Iraq war. He became single digit Jeb in the Republican primary. Anyone tied to Bush's Iraq war is toast. \n\nBiden will a hard time if Burisma investigation becomes part of the senate impeachment trial. That and his voting for the Iraq war will bury him alive and there will be very mourners definately not as many mourners as Suleimani, Biden's recent talk of admitting 2 million migrants will be the final nail in his coffin. Biden, if he does not win Iowa or NH will be finished. Democrats will be foolish to nominate Biden.\n\nI predict Trump's chances of losing in 2020 is 5%, the same as Hillary Clinton's chance losing in 2016 according to NY Times. Turns out Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 and Trump could lose in 2020 unless he flips 5% that did not vote for him in 2016.

One need only consider the political likes of the late Lee Atwater, among others, to recognize the political shell game long played by the GOP.\n\nDonald Trump, the most inexperienced political leader in the nation's history, brought what to some is a refreshing iconoclast into the White House. In reality, he is more properly viewed as being bereft of guiding principles, save those which cater to his own selfishness and personal or political benefit. \n\nSo it's not that Republicans have abandoned any principles. It's that they have abandoned any pretense of having them, when in fact, they have allowed Donald Trump to strip off the disingenuous veneer that might have made them acceptable and at least somewhat respectable.\n\nIt's fair to state that all politicians are opportunists. It's just how they roll. But the Republican Party and its supporters have become overtly undemocratic, with a small D, and the opportunism which is their north star deprives them of any claim to holding the moral high ground, let alone of putting the country first. \n\nIt takes a whole lot to make Dick Cheney look good, but it's one thing that Trump seems good at doing.",

Trump met with Kim to see if something would lead to a nuclear free peninsular. No active president even considered that. When Kim backed off, Trump walked. The time to stop Kim was long passed and sanctions did nothing to stop his pathway to a nuclear bomb and missiles to carry it. But  Trump tried. Trump verbalized openly that the NATO partners were not paying their share. Now they are increasing their military spending.  He sent in bomb attacks after Assad used gas on citizens. Assad stopped using gas. The NYT gave him credit for defeating the ISIS Islamic State.  When our embassy was attacked, he immediately sent in 750  marines to protect it. When he killed Suleimani, he killed someone who should have been killed a long time ago. Obama and Bush let him live. The deaths, wounding, and maiming of our troupes  rest totally on their shoulders. Iran's response to our killing Suleimani was to send 20 rockets which did little damage, and hurt no one. They announced they were finished and made sure Trump got the message that they did not want war with us. So now we aren't at war with Iran  and a horrible terrorist is dead. Not bad.",

In my view though, the greatest problem this article points out is the problem in the American voting public.

They are unable to climb out of the depths because they neither desire to nor care for their country, only their own self-glorification.  They are an amoral band now, with corrupted souls.

How prescient, indeed, considering our entrapment there now after more than 15 years.  Next, Mr. Mann is absolutely right on the money when he implies  Trump's total ineptness in being the Commander-in-Chief  and how the Republican Party is in a downward spiral since its \"transformation\" as being the Party of Trump.

But Bolton at least is unhappy with Trump's shakedown of President Zelensky, a \"drug deal\".\n\nTrump has learned from experience. He views the Iraq War as a disaster, and wants to avoid repeating that. He views the take over of the American Embassy in Tehran as a disaster, and wants to avoid a similar incident. He wants very much to appear tough.\n\nHe is certainly not guilt of over-rigidity. He is  no Margaret Thatcher (The Lady is not for turning). He has no fixed foreign policy. He is guilty of what used be to be called \"situational ethics.\" He is improvisational and will turn on a dime.\n\nThat  is why allies and adversaries find him confusing. He thinks that is a strategy:  Back foot everyone. But it isn't. It's the product of a disorganized personality.",

I'm not sure Trump is sane enough to even know he's lying: \"I say it, therefore it must be true!\"\n\nBut Cheney was delusional as well, convinced that by conquering Iraq, we'd be welcomed for tossing out Saddam, they'd LOVE us building giant bases there.  Then those bases would be like the \"Death Star\"--\"This station is now the ultimate power in the universe!\" and would keep all the Middle East in line.  And it would all be funded by (stealing) Iraq's oil, which would also make us independent of the other OPEC nations.  \n\nOf course, none of this happened, but we got the Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, a revised abuse-able FISA and a nation drowning in unnecessary debt that began falling apart in 2007.\n\nBoth ignore inconvenient facts and the difference is Trump ignores ALL facts, not just inconvenient ones.  Neither respects democracy or the Constitution.  Cheney even broached the idea of suspending the 2004 Presidential Election.  There's a reason he's known as \"Darth Cheney\".",

Trump was perfectly justified in retaliating and his retaliating was against Iran and not its proxies.\n\nOur strike was perfectly executed.  Not a single civilian wounded.  Their response was not only ineffective and weak, but demonstrated their incompetence and the perfidy of their government.  Our first unparalleled victory in this war.\n\nInstead of foreign disputes stopping at our nation's shores we get Liz questioning why now, as if this is a distraction from the impeachment nonsense.  Sorry, Liz you may accept another Benghazi but we don't.  Bernie accuses Trump of a war crime.  A fan of the Soviet Union and Venezuela knows nothing about true war crimes.

They were all, roughly, imperialistic, like \"let's try to build a democracy there,\" \"we can't allow a stubbornly anti-American regime to keep going (WMDs et al.),\" or \"good to have a controllable military presence on Iran's border.\"\n\nThe party's behavior over the last 15 years shows that there is only one rationale that fits: Cheney and his \"party's neoconservatives\" needed to get us back on the kind of war footing that had been the base of their political power since the 20s and that most scholars saw as the glue that held the right together across otherwise divergent ideologies of economy, race, freedom, militarization, budgeting, etc...\n\nThis need to preserve power through war and fear trumps even conservatives' quite intelligent view of American Imperialism.  Their actions, from the Iraq War to their complicity with Trump,throw even this on the pyre in an effort to hold power beyond the limited years they have left with an increasingly diverse and humanistic electorate.",

Carter was honest enough to discuss reducing U.S. energy demand --which tainted most of our foreign policy decisions-- by raiding gasoline taxes. Mr. Carter encouraged congress to pass a wide variety of energy saving tax incentives (some commenters may remember getting storm door bucks). He led the way by having solar panels installed on the White House roof.\n\nPres. Reagan couldn't take those down fast enough.\n\nThe next two GOP presidents -- Bush the elder and younger--had made money in the oil business. \n\nBy 2008, when GOP v.p. candidate Palin introduced \"drill, baby, drill\" the goal had subtly shifted from using our own extractives  as one of the means to make the U.S. energy independent. Now domestic oil, gas, and shale extraction, with the pipelines to carry them, have become the ends to which the GOP will sacrifice clean air, watersheds, and perhaps the future of our planet.",

The worst decision America made (prior to Prohibition of course .... which was was thankfully repealed) was to pass the 17th amendment in 1913, which provided Senators with their own electoral mandates, thereby shifting the power (of we, the people) that the Founders had intended, from the (democratically elected, representative) House to a new innately undemocratic, demographic Senate.  \n\nIMHO, a mad King with designated, brown-nosing Courtiers, in combination with a fearful Senate that supports his madness, is unlikely to lead to  good government.",

It must carefully and consistently be communicated to the world in the words and actions of our consummate professionals within the State department and in the armed forces. \n\nIn the Trump whitehouse, however, a foreign policy is an near thoughtless exercise of crafting policy willy nilly on a day to day basis. More often than not, this confounds our enemies and allies alike, making peace less assured. In three years, Trump has created a powder keg of instability worldwide and has nurtured a growing disaffection among our allies. This, in turn, serves to narrow our negotiative and military options, and eliminates our military reserve depth. \n\nWhen a conflict does occur, as it inevitably will, we may lack the essential support and understanding of our fellow allies.",

They are embarked on a kind of revolutionary restructuring of government and society that puts power in the hands of a small ultra conservative group and deprives all other sectors of society of a political voice. The Republicans have always worked toward these goals but under Trump the law breaking and voter suppression efforts have come out in the open and become the core of the party platform. There are no limits to how far a political movement will go once it has renounced allegiance to the law. Trump now openly conspires with foreign states to interfere with US elections for his benefit. His party is openly blocking funds to help the states defend themselves against foreign cyber attack because those attacks are designed to keep Republicans in power. This is far different than the Bush or Cheney doctrines which had at their core a defense of national sovereignty. Today's Republicans are openly subverting national interest and working with foreign enemies to weaken the US economy and national defense. Such treason for the suicidal purpose of personal power is new to America and in fact to any other country.",

He merely has more power and a greater responsibility to wield that power faithfully.\n\nWhen Trump spent years attacking Jeff Sessions for not being loyal to him and not protecting him from investigation, he was usurping the power of We the People. Sessions was not supposed to be loyal to Trump or protect him.

Where does the money go? Straight back into the local economies. It pays bills so businesses don't go broke and puts food on the table.  It works. It has always worked, simply because it delivers value for the economy in tough times. Try finding that in any political theory. \n\nRoosevelt's logic was right - Politics can't beat what it can't live without.

The Kaiser Foundation, CBO and other responsible mass media outlets think tanks and universities have published literally tens of thousands of pages, graphics and thousands of hours of interviews detailing the positive life-altering impact of Obamacare on communities throughout the U.S.; particularly those which overwhelming supported the election of Mr. Trump in 2016.\n\nYet Obamacare has been the target of an unrelenting attack in the public media, Congress, state and federal courts seeking to discredit and dismantle it. In comparison, the Social Security Act proposed by FDR and signed into law in 1934, faced similar initial vitriol but due to the Great Depression and Social Security's success in alleviating epidemic poverty among the elderly, it survived and thrived.",

It's instrumental to Dems selling their government solutions to problems that have been festering without policy address for too long.  Taxation as the price paid for the freedoms and democracy you possess is a good message that's never heard here, and it doesn't mean increasing taxes on middle and low incomes in today's economy.\n\nI offer another neglected messaging device--the internet.  Somehow, attracting people to government services, to what  government can do if not does, has to be a greater priority.  The Obamacare exchanges meant many Americans had to go online to get essential health care services, and once it was working, it accomplished a vital pr role.  Can we do the same thing for housing, climate action, gun issues, etc?  Making citizens more active between elections has to be a goal of any right-thinking party (ie, not the current Republican party of \"no\").",

In it, he dsaid the Republicans are successful about boiling down their programs to a few simple words like 'tax relief,' and leave it at that.  They are skilled at not letting the public know who the tax relief is for, much like the cuts in 2017, most of it going to the top 2%.\nStep it up Dems!",

Clinton & Obama were basically errand boys for Wall Street and did what they were told. For all the proclamations that like FDR, the Democrats are friends to labor, THEY AREN'T!!!!! Clinton could have vetoed NAFTA the senate couldn't have overrode it & He definitely chose to allow China into the WTO thus precipitating the wholesale destruction of the middle class & unions. If that's your idea of pro-Labor? \n\nThe ACA which (so many is the most wonderful thing) is for a lot of people worthless. When I had it, it was $450 a month with a 7K deductible on my munificent 33K a year. A great deal for the insurance company sure. A deal for me hardly. \n\nBut boy Obama & Clinton did very very well out of their post presidency. Well rewarded by the people whose errands they ran while in office. \n\nWhen you have to refer to the accomplishments of a man dead these 80 years in a run for office you have trouble. When you straight faced compare those 2 to FDR ? Your beyond trouble into desperation.",

They can't even put out one unified slogan, like Defeat Republicans, or For the Many, Not The Few, or maybe Democrats Help People Who Need Help; Republicans help people who DON'T Need Help.

I suspect it has more to do with providing a smokescreen for simply not favoring direct-assistance programs to improve people's lives.\nSure, some of the rightward turn the party's taken over the past 40 years has to do with perceptions of what voters' values are, but I think it has more to do with what these politicians actually value. They're largely well-educated members of the professional-managerial elite. It's just who they are. Their own identification largely isn't with workers, or even the middle class (not really). Look at Obama's appointments for evidence of this. \nI'm leaning towards voting for Sanders in the primary, as I think very few people sincerely doubt where his loyalties lie. Warren is a close second, because while she happily traded her middle-class roots for a job at Harvard, she's shown a real willingness to question DC conventional wisdom on the wisdom of things like Obama hiding benefits in 6-point font on people's paystubs.

Because Obama had no such projects to point to.  There was actually very little increase in government spending or investment after 2007:\n\n<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GCEC1\" target=\"_blank\">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GCEC1</a>\n\nand most of this was because of automatic expenditures such as unemployment compensation which happened before the 2009 stimulus.  There was actually a greater decrease in real spending and investment 2010-2014 than increase 2008-2010.  And why was the fiscal response of the Obama administration so feeble?  Partly because a fear of deficits, but certainly faith in the magical monetary powers of the Fed was a major influence with Obama's advisors.  If such powers of central banks existed, the recovery would have been faster, there would have been considerable inflation because of low rates as the recovery proceeded, and Europe and Japan, where rates are actually negative, would be doing much better than the US, where rates have been raised since 2015.\n\nWhat is done with government spending in the next recession will probably be far more important than how any small tax cuts for consumers are distributed.  Democrats had better decide whether they can leave their political fate up to the Fed or not.",

However, Leonhardt's advise to today's Democrats is focused on window dressing progressive ideas; that is insufficient.\n\nWarren's agenda is praised as the closest to FDR's in simplicity of message but critiqued on not adequately selling  government as a force for good. However, reading her multiple plans (elizabethwarren.com), the short, straight forward synopses all point to improvements in individual lives and to the nation as a whole. For example, she spells out how she will make for medicare the plan of choice for all who want it, for research and development of renewable energy that builds up our economy and how she'll use legislative  carrots and sticks to lower drug prices. \n\nBut it is on the huge, gross wealth inequality and the dominant influence of money and corporate power that plagues us today. Here is where Warren shines. Her agenda is, above all, to level the playing field. Her plans are grounded in the new economic field studying inequality. (Two scholars in this field are 2019 Nobel laureates.) Read up on this is \"The Triumph of Injustice\" by Saez and Zucman, two other scholars of this new field and the advisers to Warren and more recently, to Sanders. \n\nIn sum, Warren with her bold, systemic changes to make government work for us, is the FDR for America today.",

They of course had more time on their hands. This often resulted on the lazy workers getting a reputation for being the most effective with the most productive workers being under estimated.  A similar phenomena  repeats itself over and over in politics with   Democratic accomplishments being  understated and underestimated and the Republicans cashing in politically through obfuscation and deception.

This is a historical context that should receive more attention.\n\nFDR ushered in a durable political era, lasting until the late 1970s, in which both major political parties were suspicious of extreme accumulations of wealth and power -- both political and economic power. The aversion to both types of power was informed by recent experience: The Great Depression, caused by overly concentrated economic power, and the rise of fascism, caused by overly concentrated political power. Moreover, Americans in this era felt, correctly, that these kinds of concentrated powers were linked with each other.\n\nThis era ended in the late 1970s, and came to be replaced by what we could call the Reagan consensus -- in which both parties now agree that the extreme accumulation of economic power is not in itself a problem -- hence the era of deregulation that continues today -- but only disagree about how much to tax this wealth after it accumulates.  Naturally, we are now seeing the specter of fascism rising again, in connection to the historic economic inequality this neoliberalism has created, but this time it's rising in our own country.\n\nWarren is the candidate who best understands this process, and is likeliest to finally end this Reagan era. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710</a>/",

Elizabeth Warren, for one, gets this.\n\nThe dilemma for Democrats is this is a compelling story in its simplicity. And in a consumer driven economy, taxes serve as a focus to illustrate it: the government takes tax revenue that you cannot spend as you would like. Democrats have tiptoed around this focus and shifted to the right to appease Republican voters and members of Congress. It convinced enough Republican voters to re-elect Clinton and Obama, but not so much in Congress. As a result, we have the most expensive and least efficient healthcare delivery system in the developed world, we continue to reward fossil fuel companies while they compound climate change and we fail to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. \n\nUnfortunately, a primary focus of Democratic debates has been healthcare, which is complex because some types of jobs, like private insurance, would be lost. A more Roosevelt-ian approach would be to focus on infrastructure, which is tangible to everyone and creates jobs. A side benefit is that investing in infrastructure is a failed Trump campaign promise. \n\nThe simpler and more visible a campaign proposal is, the more compelling the message is to most voters",

There is a tendency to give people too much credit when it comes to comprehending our government, when, to most people, it is out of sight, out of mind. \n\nAs you point out, most people don't understand how government works because they don't see--in tangible ways--what government does. They don't see how it benefits them, or their community, or society, or the country.  At most they see some dirt-poor minority family on tv smiling because, due to an obscure government program, they are now going to be able to stay in their apartment! Or have milk for their kids!\n\nThis is one of the reasons that (enough) tax-paying voters don't rally behind Progressives: They always seem to be talking about how we all need to use government to help someone else who is less fortunate than us. Government as social medicine. Yeah, well, ok.\n\nWhen, like millions of other citizens, I watched Ronald Reagan hold a dollar bill up to the camera and ask \"Are you better off?\" I knew then that he would be elected (as disturbing as that was). Democrat operatives prefer to think that people are too sophisticated for these tactics. Some are.  But the vast majority are busy with their own stuff and only think about government at tax time, when their hard-earned dollar goes down some invisible rat-hole, or else they are lucky and are getting a refund of their own money.

Medicare is administered by dozens and dozens of private corporations (look at Medicare Advantage and Part D). Medicare still can wipe out a family with just one hospital visit. \nEvery week I speak with people who fancy themselves \"activists\" who honestly believe that Americans over 65 get free healthcare. Naturally, these people are themselves well under 65.  \nSomewhere along the line we got this bait and switch. And government will eventually, after a coy struggle, \"give\" us Medicare 4 All - and we'll be stuck with it for generations. When people who demanded this find out that Medicare is not free (by a long-shot!) elected officials will reply, \"But we GAVE you what you wanted,\" as they retire and go to work for the insurance lobby...\nThanks, folks.

They won\u2019t let me post a comment that\u2019s long enough to tear this entire article apart, so I\u2019ll pick one idiotic phrase: \u201cIn climate policy, this would mean putting more emphasis on a green-jobs program than on a hated carbon tax.\u201d\n\nMy two cents: The carbon tax is hated, because people who currently need to use carbon-based fuels rightfully feel that they\u2019ll be punished for living their lives.  That, by the way, is why Emmanuel Macron\u2019s administration was derailed by the \u201cyellow vest\u201d protestors.\n\nThe obvious solution is to take the proceeds from a carbon-tax and hand it back to the people in the form of a per-capita monthly rebate check.  The end result is that someone who uses an average amount of carbon-based fuels will break even.  Someone who uses more than average will pay a premium, and someone who uses less carbon-based fuel than average will actually make money.  But everyone will have an incentive to reduce their carbon footprint.  Own a house?  Maybe it\u2019s time for better insulation or a new HVAC system.  Buying a new car/truck?  Maybe gas mileage should be a factor.\n\nBottom line: Centrally planned economies fail each and every time.  It\u2019s far better to use a little nudging so that people are incented to do the right thing.",

If rising tides raise all ships, FDR benefited from it, as has the country. \n\nPoliticians today, however, too often see only the benefits that inure to their own political fortunes in the next election. While Democrats and Republicans generally share different interests and priorities, what they most often share is self-interest and the perpetuation of their political careers. At the same time, they are mired in the muck of short-term thinking, much as leaders of publicly-held corporations have long focused on quarter-to-quarter results.\n\nAmerica's political leaders, it seems, have lost their long-term focus, while Americans themselves have seemingly lost their will to sacrifice in order to ensure a better future. It's a combination that does not serve the country's best interests.\n\nI don't have anything good to say about Mitch McConnell, but he has relentlessly focused on stacking the judiciary with conservative judges, whose presence on the bench will have a lasting and serious impact on the country going forward. It's not something that he's been particularly overt about, but it will long affect the tectonic plates of the country. \n\nWhat the Democrats need is a candidate who has such a vision, relatable in simple but tangible terms as being of benefit to American lives. Elizabeth Warren may offer such programs, but for many, she, like Bernie Sanders, goes too far. Republicans, it seems, run the table.",

WW2 ended the great depression. Until then, there just wasn't enough for everyone to do. \n\nAccording to US government statistics, during the height of the depression, unemployment ran around 20%. By 1940 it was down to about 14%, and in 1942 it dropped to 4.7%. It's likely that Roosevelt's projects made the 6% difference.\n\nIn other words, there was no systemic change. The improvement was palliative and temporary. It took mobilizing the nation to fight the war that created the structural improvement, and it has been the constant war footing that has kept it robust. Stop that and the depression will come back immediately.\n\nBy all means, fix our crumbling infrastructure, but don't fool yourself: the economy can't sustain itself without massive government spending and employment. And to sustain that, you need to either raise taxes or borrow. \n\nI don't care for this reality, but I recognize it for what it is.

But I understand it, one cannot offer Open Borders and Medicare for all at the same time, and by choosing Open Borders the Dems are not helping the American workers but the American corporations which need \"slave work\".  The way to go would be to offer Medicare for all, and a possibility to have private insurance, in parallel, one that has no copays and deductibles. (I have both in Europe and believe me nobody abuses the system because of this.)  \n\nThe biggest problem with American taxes is that people get nothing from them, save free public libraries, this is why it is so unpopular to ask for more. In Europe, where people pay taxes just a tiny bit higher, people get a lot more for their taxes, free education in public universities for qualified candidates, universal healthcare, and 2 years of maternal leave.  Most of American taxes go toward servicing the huge national debt and military budget, and to pay the very high salaries of various bureaucrats. \n\nThe Dems are as guilty as the Republicans for all the policies that eroded the standard of living, such as quantitative easing (Obama) that made everything too expensive while opening the gates to millions of illegal immigrants willing to work under the minimum wage, which put no pressure on salaries -- thus sucking off the blood of the  American worker at both ends.",

At least that is what H.R.C. thought would happen in 2016 and worse still she thought she was entitled and anointed to win and how she would govern was not that important and needing her government to be seen if she was president was secondary to her personal ambition of being seen as the first woman president of the USA after 44 men. \n\nDemocrats of today don't get what it will take to win when the state of the Union is strong and all attempts to strike D.J.T. have been futile and some of the strikes like the hyper partisan impeachment will actually ensure the reelection of Trump especially when the only Democratic presidential candidate for 2020 from the current US house of reps Ms Tulsi Gabbard actually did not support the impeachment vote.

In Europe, higher effective income taxes are also not met with as much resistance as in the United states.  Discontent exists, but over the size of the allocation of the pie, not the taxation that creates it. \nIn the US, federal policy and debate is endless over taxation.  The reason is simple, the solution not so much.  The US is large and geographically diverse.  When the feds built a bridge in Seattle or a port in South Carolina, or improve the Mississippi river system, folks in New York, Texas and Ohio don't feel a connection to those projects. \n In Europe and at our state level, expenditures are more localized, with the benefits, direct and indirect, more transparent.  So, Federal taxes seem to go into a black hole, and there is an excessive focus on social programs (like food stamps) with a tiny budget impact, more out of frustration than substance. \nTransparency and communication would go a long way in addressing this problem.",

However, if we're aiming for FDR's alphabet soup, you'll ultimately admit Sanders is more free from the charge of over bureaucracritizing the federal governmet.

That's a really easy idea to understand.\n\nAn idea that would meaningfully impact millions of American lives without the uncertainty of asking, \"Do I qualify?\" Yes, Sanders's plan would help relatively wealthy students too.

We're trying to help children who weren't so lucky.\n\nRemember the student loan forgiveness program?

For example, the benefits of Obamacare (to purposely use an outdated name) were accompanied by such complex insurance offerings that most people had little to hold onto.  I hate to say it, but the gratification offered by Dubya's rebate, stands our clearly in my mind.  Every time I watch our large screen TV, I recall the rebate check used to buy it.  And I don't know what the Democrats could do to be so gratifying.  Now if they could show people how much money they'd have to spend due to lower costs from Medicare for all, they could have a selling point.  Without opposition, often the Republicans get away with attacking legislation, naming added costs created.  Weaponizing Medicare for all with rebates to consumers is a way to counter that, as goofy as it sounds.  Perhaps rebates for high mileage cars would help.  But many enjoy driving around in glamorized Sherman tanks.  I guess they, too, can be redesigned as electric vehicles, along with subcompact cars.",

It was a shrewd statement that ensured his re-election.  Just a few years before Reagan had declared the government to be the problem, not the solution. By declaring the demise of big goverment Clinton was co-opting enough of Reagan's popularity to ensure his own.  But Clinton's political success was gained at the price of a major shift in power from the people to corporations and plutocrats which gets harder to undo every day.  Elizabeth Warren is a fighter.  If she wins the Democratic nomination and the presidency, she will have to fight the good fight in a very big way indeed.",

While I think any expansion of Medicare should be optional (for purely political reasons), there are few private employer plans that come close to the coverage and value of either Traditional Medicare with a supplement or Medicare Advantage.  \n\nIn fact, the greatest hazard in expanding Medicare would be the potential collapse of private insurance plans from enrollees fleeing to Medicare and destabilizing provider networks built on charging two or three times what Medicare pays for procedures. \n\nPhasing in Medicare by descending age groups, with additional buy-in premiums as previously proposed, could mitigate this risk. \n\nWhile the ACA has many positive features, it is basically unaffordable for those in their 50s and 60s  who don't qualify for subsidies or Medicaid. \n\nAnd employer insurance plans are also becoming unafforable for both employers and workers, with higher premiums, deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-pocket limits. \n\nMaybe our health care system is doomed to death by demagoguery (remember Sarah Palin's \"death panels\"?) and the corrupt influence of the medical lobby. \n\nAnother recession might just be the catalyst for big changes.",

It\u2019s very true that FDR and the democrats did all that and much more, you can throw in social security and winning the war , but even so, it wasn\u2019t long before Americans were voting in republicans to take their place.  If Obama had gone the whole way and given America universal health care back when, it wouldn\u2019t have been long before the American voters in their wisdom and ungratefulness would be dumping Dems in favor of republicans. I guess there is a psychological reason for this but the easiest explanation is that voters are fickle and though they want the free goodies the Dems offer they prefer to check things with republicans before socialism goes too far. It\u2019s always one step forward and two steps backward , the universal right to vote has its drawbacks and lack of common sense is one aspect.",

If the carbon tax is revenue neutral and is returned to every citizen evenly, what citizens would see is the dividend they receive. People would love it, just as Alaskans like their old dividend. It would also not be seen as welfare, since all get the same amount, but in fact those who consumed less fossil fuels through what they purchased would get back more than they paid in higher prices and those who consumed more than average would get back less than they paid. This would help those who keep their carbon footprint low, which also would include those of low income who consume less.",

The system became more and more skewed, and the momentum increased with the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine and the Citizens United decision.  So now people vote less often and pay less attention, feeling they cannot influence or benefit from government policy, which only benefits and reinforces the oligarch.

We need any President - Republican or Democrat - to actually repair and upgrade our infrastructure. THAT would be a winner.  Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act, and other amazing agencies for which we give him no credit. But again, they morphed into something he did not envision or intend. Democrats Kennedy and Johnson fathered the Space Program that has been the source of the majority of our technological and medical advances.

The idea that the federal gov has to pay for things with taxes or borrowing is just plain wrong. \n\nThe gov doesn't need your money. It can (thru the FED) create as much as it needs out of thin air. Just think about where money you pay your taxes with came from in the first place. Unless you have a printing press in your basement, it originally came from the federal gov. \n\nBut there's a catch. If the gov needs to create too much money to do the things we want it to do, we may not be able to make enough stuff to soak that money up & will have too much money chasing not enough stuff, i.e. excessive inflation. This is rare & is usually caused by shortages, e,g, of oil. \n\nBut that's easy to solve & where taxes come in. Taxes allow the gov to take back the excess money & prevent inflation. The purpose of taxes is to adjust the amount of money in the private sector. The more we can produce, the lower taxes can be. So the way to run things is to spend money to facilitate production. \n\nTax cuts do this, but in an inefficient way. If we cut Daddy Warbuck's taxes, he does not need to spend the money; he uses it for financial speculation. If we cut poor Joe's taxes, he spends the money on stuff--food, house paint, etc.etc. This promotes production of food, etc. Even better if we pay Joe to fix a bridge, the money still gets into the economy, AND we get the bridge fixed.",

The slump continued through the entire decade of the 1930s.  \n\nThe worst year was 1932, with an unemployment of 25%.  This is an incredible number.  Normal (nominal \"full employment\") is about 4%, so we had unemployment increase six fold. adding another 21% of unemployed persons.  \n\nBy comparison, The Great Recession of 2008-2011 saw unemployment reach only 10%.  From the normal 4%,  the recession added  only another 6% of unemployed persons.\n\nThe Great Depression remained far above the unemployment figures for our fairly recent slump.  After some amelioration, the unemployment rate rose upward to 19% in 1938.  And the average for the next three years, 1939-1941 was 17%, still much higher than the worst of the Great Recession.\n\nKeynes taught us that under, and ONLY under, the condition of a complete investment slump (ie, no new factories, etc) the cure for unemployment is running a scandalously high deficit.\n\nThe problem is that Roosevelt's budget was nowhere near enough to heal the depression. \n\nIt was cured by the far more effective  jobs and deficit program known as the Second World War.  \n\nTotal federal expenditure for the four (4) years of the war was about 5 times as large as it was during the previous nine (9) years of Roosevelt's administration.",

(For perspective, the current US budget is about $4.4 trillion, with a deficit of about $1 trillion.) \n\nAs Margaret Thatcher aptly noted, the problem with socialism is that sooner or later you run out of other people\u2019s money. \n\nDon\u2019t forget that our goal in 2020 is to elect a Democratic president, and that will require appealing to the independents, undecideds and others whom the Democrats failed to reach in 2016. \n\nIf all of these progressive (socialist) promises, or even a few, are planks in the 2020 Democratic platform we are doomed to a second term of Trump as president.",

Some Sanders progressives are kinda doing the same when they continue to mistakenly blame Obama for the crash. Obama with Pelosi's help saved the economy, folks. Otherwise we have had a real depression. On the merits Warren should be one of the leaders. She has real accomplishments on her record, like the Consumer Financial protection Bureau, as noted here, which has helped millions of Americans. Sanders, for instance, has accomplished nothing like it. Her plans are honest and realistic and attainable--unlike Sanders. She has adopted the best climate plan we have, namely Inslee's--which is, according to virtually all of the experts, much better than Sanders. Though Sanders progressives claim otherwise, her varied background is a strength. Once upon a time she was a progressive. As a lawyer she also worked on, for example, corporate bankruptcy. Her record indicates she knows how to take what she can get today, and live to fight on another day. Sadly, as NPR reported a month or so ago, a significant enough proportion of Democrats, motivated as strongly by gender as by policy, were planning to vote for Sanders or Biden based on gender alone. On the merits, Warren should be among the leaders.",

I worked for a state agency that operated a residential occupational training program for employable disabled young adults. The buildings were old, the plumbing, heating and electrical systems unreliable and unsafe, and the agency had been trying unsuccessfully for years to get the Republican state legislature to build or relocate to better facilities. Then came the Obama stimulus program for \"shovel-ready\" projects. A blueprint for a new facility that had been gathering dust was funded and a little over a year later we had a beautiful new center. In none of the press releases from the agency was it mentioned where the money originally came from, only that it came from the state labor department . Even our own employees weren't told it was a federal stimulus project. When the groundbreaking happened, the Republican state labor commissioner, district Republican state legislators and county commissioner were there to get their pictures taken and take credit for it. They said nothing like, \"We would like to thank President Obama and Congress for making this new facility possible and creating good jobs in our community.\" I had to write a letter to the editor of the local newspaper to \"reveal\" where the money had come from. Need I say more about Republican tactics to oppose President Obama and \"big government\"?",

            "comment_body": "Warren is right about letting people know the government wants to help in every way it can. The Republicans announce a huge tax cut and lie about it being intended for the middle-class and that never happens since the benficiaries are the wealthy and even wealthier corporations. Trump's wall is another example: it's going to keep Americans from being overrun by hordes of savages at the gates and the best part is Mexico is going to pay fore it - a big fat lie on both counts. Or Trump's announcing he and Kim Jung Un are in love - excuse me but I didn't see Valentine cards ever being exchanged just venomous comments on both sides. Or China is going to pay for the tariffs when Americans are bearing the cost. So, if you're a Republican simply lie to Americans and it works as well as selling snake oil. But Democrats have to tell the truth and that means telling people they are going to benefit from every campaign idea and then make sure the benefits are real - which is why I am not a Sanders supporter. Warren will make programs work and Sanders still has to depend on the Magic Wand he is going to wave over GOP politicians so that they are enthralled by his programs. Not likely. Warren/Booker will get the job done and it will be real and all Americans, even Republicans, will benefit even those Republicans who grumble about the cost. And positive change costs a lot less than change that is meant to punish the poor, the sick, the disabled and the elderly.",

Obama's case, he was reined in by a Republican Congress for six of his eight years in office.\n\nBut more importantly, the vast majority of Americans no longer want to see the tangible results of governing. Some 45% of our citizens (largely whites) vote entirely on race and abortion - and these two issues propelled the most unfit president in my lifetime (and I remember Eisenhower) into the White House. That nothing has been done to help their families is completely inconsequential to them. They vote for Republicans because they want to \"punish\" brown skinned people and women.\n\nThen another 20% of Americans are completely apathetic. They don't follow any national events or actions coming out of this White House or Congress. Perhaps they don't mind falling farther and farther behind in this country - at least not enough to start paying attention.\n\nThis leaves roughly one-third of us for whom Mr. Leonhardt's thesis is meaningful. But we're not enough to win elections.
