            "full_text": " Greta Versus the Greedy Grifters Why a 17-year-old is\n a better economist than Steve Mnuchin. By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist I\u2019ve \nnever been a fan of Davos, that annual gathering of the rich and fatuous. One \nvirtue of the pageant of preening and self-importance, however, is that it \nbrings out the worst in some people, leading them to say things that reveal \ntheir vileness for all to see. And so it was for Steven Mnuchin, Donald Trump\u2019s \nTreasury secretary. First, Mnuchin doubled down on his claim that the 2017 tax \ncut will pay for itself \u2014 just days after his own department confirmed that the \nbudget deficit in 2019 was more than $1 trillion, 75 percent higher than it was \nin 2016. Then he sneered at Greta Thunberg, the young climate activist, \nsuggesting that she go study economics before calling for an end to investment \nin fossil fuels. Well, unearned arrogance is a Trump administration hallmark \u2014 \nwitness Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, claiming that a respected national \nsecurity reporter couldn\u2019t find Ukraine on a map. So it may not surprise you to \nlearn that Mnuchin was talking nonsense and that Thunberg almost certainly has \nit right. One can only surmise that Mnuchin slept through his undergraduate \neconomics classes. Otherwise he would know that every, and I mean every, major \nEcon 101 textbook argues for government regulation or taxation of activities \nthat pollute the environment, because otherwise neither producers nor consumers \nhave an incentive to take the damage inflicted by this pollution into account. \nAnd burning fossil fuels is a huge source of environmental damage, not just from\n climate change but also from local air pollution, which is a major health \nhazard we don\u2019t do nearly enough to limit. The International Monetary Fund makes\n regular estimates of worldwide subsidies to fossil fuels \u2014 subsidies that \npartly take the form of tax breaks and outright cash grants, but mainly involve \nnot holding the industry accountable for the indirect costs it imposes. In 2017 \nit put these subsidies at $5.2 trillion; yes, that\u2019s trillion with a \u201cT.\u201d For \nthe U.S., the subsidies amounted to $649 billion, which is about $3 million for \nevery worker employed in the extraction of coal, oil and gas. Without these \nsubsidies, it\u2019s hard to imagine that anyone would still be investing in fossil \nfuels. But maybe Mnuchin thinks that the I.M.F. should also take some courses in\n economics \u2014 along with the thousands of economists, including every living \nformer Federal Reserve chair, dozens of Nobel laureates, and chief economists \nfrom both Democratic and Republican administrations, who signed an open letter \ncalling for taxes on emissions of greenhouse gases. In short, Greta Thunberg may\n be only 17, but her views are much closer to the consensus of the economics \nprofession than those of the guy clinging to the zombie idea that tax cuts pay \nfor themselves. But could the economics consensus be wrong? Yes, but probably \nbecause it isn\u2019t hard enough on fossil fuels. On one side, a number of experts \nargue that standard models underestimate the risks of climate change, both \nbecause they don\u2019t account for its disruptive effects and because they don\u2019t put\n enough weight on the possibility of total catastrophe. On the other side, \nestimates of the cost of reducing emissions tend to understate the role of \ninnovation. Even modest incentives for expanded use of renewable energy led to a\n spectacular fall in prices over the past decade. I still often find people \u2014 \nboth right-wingers and climate activists \u2014 asserting that sharply reducing \nemissions would require a big decline in G.D.P. Everything we know, however, \nsays that this is wrong, that we can decarbonize while continuing to achieve \nrobust growth. Given all this, however, why are people like Mnuchin and his boss\n Trump so adamantly pro-fossil fuel and anti-environmentalist? Part of the \nanswer, I believe, is that conservatives don\u2019t want to admit that government \naction is ever justified. Once you concede that the government can do good by \nprotecting the environment, people might start thinking that it can guarantee \naffordable health care, too. The bigger issue, however, is sheer greed. Given \nthe scale of subsidies we give to fossil fuels, the industry as a whole should \nbe regarded as a gigantic grift. It makes money by ripping off everyone else, to\n some extent through direct taxpayer subsidies, to a greater extent by shunting \nthe true costs of its operations off onto innocent bystanders. And let\u2019s be \nclear: Many of those \u201ccosts\u201d take the form of sickness and death, because that\u2019s\n what local air pollution causes. Other costs take the form of \u201cnatural\u201d \ndisasters like the burning of Australia, which increasingly bear the signature \nof climate change. In a sane world we\u2019d be trying to shut this grift down. But \nthe grifters \u2014 which overwhelmingly means corporations and investors, since \nlittle of that $3-million-per-worker subsidy trickles down to the workers \nthemselves \u2014 have bought themselves a lot of political influence. And so people \nlike Mnuchin claim not to see anything wrong with industries whose profits \ndepend almost entirely on hurting people. Maybe he should take a course in \neconomics \u2014 and another one in ethics. ",

            "full_text": " This Question Is More Important Than Removing Trump \nCan a sitting president block witnesses at his own impeachment trial? By Claire \nFinkelstein Ms. Finkelstein is a professor of law and philosophy at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania. This week, as part of the impeachment trial of \nPresident Trump, the Senate will take up the question of subpoenas for witnesses\n and documents. House managers had previously tried but failed to convince their\n Republican colleagues to go along with a series of amendments on witnesses and \ndocuments. The vote on witnesses is critical. The testimony of key \nadministration or former administration officials like Mick Mulvaney and John \nBolton may be the only remaining hope Democrats have for disabusing Republican \nsenators of their loyalty to Donald Trump before the vote on conviction. But the\n vote on witnesses is essential for another reason. The Senate is facing a test \nof the very issue under consideration in the second article of impeachment, \nnamely Mr. Trump\u2019s obstruction of Congress and the institution\u2019s willingness to \nrein in a president who is abusing the powers of his office. Regardless of their\n inclinations on the final vote to remove, every senator should understand the \ncritical nature of this decision for the integrity of the impeachment process, \nthe preservation of congressional authority and ultimately for the rule of law. \nFirst, a vote to subpoena witnesses would strike at the heart of the president\u2019s\n efforts \u2014 which continue to this day \u2014 to impede his own removal from office. \nEarlier attempts by leaders in the House to complete a detailed inquiry without \nwaiting out the courts on the issue of witnesses fell flat. Admittedly, they had\n good reasons to move on. As Jerry Nadler explained, it took eight months to get\n a Federal District Court to say that Don McGahn cannot ignore a congressional \nsubpoena, and it could have taken eight more for a final judgment affirming that\n ruling on appeal. By sending articles of impeachment to the Senate without \nhaving countered the president\u2019s interference with House proceedings, Democratic\n leaders lost an opportunity. But there is a second shot at that confrontation, \nwith the added benefit that any subpoenas the Senate issues will have bipartisan\n support. Calling a halt to Mr. Trump\u2019s obstruction of Congress is essential if \nthe process is to be impartial, independent and fully reflective of the \nconscience of our elected officials. Second, it is critical to push back on the \npresident\u2019s dangerous expansion of executive privilege, regardless of whether \nthe process results in his removal. Mr. Trump actually believes he is entitled \nto use his authority to prevent witnesses from testifying or to withhold \nincriminating documents or other evidence. Consider his open encouragement to \nwitnesses to defy subpoenas, as well as the idea he floated that he would assert\n executive privilege to block current and former administration officials from \ntestifying, for the sake of \u201cprotecting future presidents.\u201d These moves are \nconsistent with Mr. Trump\u2019s view that Article II allows him to do whatever he \nwants. If the Senate subpoenas witnesses, the Trump legal team will once more \nassert executive privilege, or the closely related idea of \u201ctestimonial \nimmunity,\u201d to block their enforcement, but this would be a gross abuse of that \nconcept. The Senate must be prepared to go to the mat to enforce any subpoenas \nit issues, or the impeachment process itself will serve to weaken congressional \nauthority and to establish the president\u2019s entitlement to use the privilege of \nhis office to immunize himself from scrutiny. The enforcement of subpoenas in an\n impeachment trial is potentially complex. The Senate Impeachment Rules provide \nthat \u201cthe Senate shall have power to compel the attendance of witnesses\u201d and to \n\u201cenforce obedience to its orders,\u201d meaning that the Senate can use its inherent \npowers to enforce any subpoena it issues during an impeachment trial. But the \nsergeant-at-arms, who is empowered to conduct enforcement for Congress, does not\n have a jail or a full police force at his disposal. Moreover, Congress has not \nused its enforcement powers since 1934 (and the action prompted an immediate \nhabeas petition from its recipient). This leaves open the possibility that the \nSenate will turn to the courts, not to rule on the validity of the subpoenas but\n to help enforce them. Alternatively, the witnesses themselves could turn to a \nfederal court to defend against a Senate order to testify. Either way, we can \nexpect to see a pitched battle between Congress\u2019 power and executive branch \nclaims of executive authority play out in federal court. In such a scenario, \nthere could be the unprecedented complication that the case could land in the \nSupreme Court while Chief Justice John Roberts is presiding over the trial. If \nJustice Roberts were to recuse himself, the country might face the specter of a \nSupreme Court deadlocked on the critical question of whether a sitting president\n undergoing an impeachment trial has the right to assert executive privilege to \nblock witnesses at his own trial. Ultimately, getting clear about the limits of \npresidential authority and strengthening Congress\u2019s hand is even more important \nfor protecting democracy and the rule of law than removing the 45th president. \nLeaving unaddressed the question of whether a president can use the powers of \nhis office to shield himself from accountability will make it impossible to undo\n the damage wrought on our system of checks and balances by the Trump \npresidency. This is the moment to push back on the expansion of presidential \npower and to reinforce the principle that we are a government of laws, not men. \nSafeguarding Congress\u2019s authority and independence is the most important task \nfacing the House managers in the Senate trial. Reasserting the ability of \nCongress to control its own process is the first step toward reclaiming that \nauthority. Claire Finkelstein is the Algernon Biddle professor of law and \nprofessor of philosophy and the faculty director of the Center for Ethics and \nthe Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. ",

            "full_text": " Vladimir Putin\u2019s New Orchestra The players are being \nrearranged, but the conductor remains the same. By Ivan Krastev Contributing \nOpinion Writer On Jan. 15, it became clear to the people of Russia that they \nwould never again have the opportunity to vote for Vladimir Putin. It also \nbecame clear that they would live with him for the foreseeable future. In his \nannual State of the Nation address, Mr. Putin promised that he would step aside \nin 2024 when his current term expires. At the same time he outlined a series of \nsweeping constitutional changes that would most likely go into force this year: \nRussia would remain a presidential republic but future presidents would be \nlimited to two terms in office. Parliament would have the right to appoint \ngovernment ministers, including the prime minister. (Currently, they are \nselected by the president and approved by Parliament.) The changes would also \nconfer additional powers to the State Council, which is now a fairly low-profile\n advisory body, leading many to believe that Mr. Putin imagines himself as the \ncouncil\u2019s chairman after 2024. The result would be that in four years Mr. Putin \ncould step aside and focus on running the world while his aides focused on \nrunning Russia. Why has Russia\u2019s powerful president chosen this route? In 2018, \nPresident Xi Jinping of China changed his country\u2019s Constitution to allow \nhimself to be president for life. Mr. Putin could easily have done the same, but\n decided against it. But Mr. Putin\u2019s timing raises questions: Why did he present\n his constitutional initiative now, four years before the end of his term, in a \nmanner that resembles a palace coup more than a political reform? The timing and\n the nature of the constitutional amendments make it evident that Mr. Putin \nperceives his regime as in crisis and is doubtful about the viability of a \nsystem of personal rule when he is no longer around. He knows perfectly well \nthat what his apologists trumpet as political stability is in reality political \nstagnation, and that popular support for the regime is in decay. It is quite \npossible that last summer\u2019s protests in Moscow and the growing apathy of his \nsupporters impelled the president to propose reforms and ask that any changes be\n legitimized by popular vote. It won\u2019t come as a shock if the referendum \ncoincides with early parliamentary elections this autumn, thus starting the \npower transition this year. Unpacking Mr. Putin\u2019s decisions, one cannot escape \nthe sense that he is haunted by memories of the sclerotic and impotent \nleadership of the Soviet Union in its waning years. That period led to crime, \neconomic decline and chaos. Russians remain scarred by it \u2014 and so Mr. Putin \ncannot allow his people to see themselves returning to life under a stagnating \nand aging elite. Mr. Putin was right to believe that any talk about his possible\n successor would be an existential threat to his power. Contrary to Boris \nYeltsin\u2019s plan for power transition \u2014 widely known as \u201cOperation Successor\u201d \u2014 \nMr. Putin\u2019s own gambit might be best described as \u201cOperation No Successor.\u201d The \nnext Russian president will not be Russia\u2019s next leader, so society should stop \nbeing interested in who he will be. His choice of Mikhail Mishutin as prime \nminister is indicative of how Mr. Putin will rearrange the new orchestra: Mr. \nMishutin, who took office when Mr. Putin announced the changes, is said to be an\n effective manager and a capable bureaucrat, but his major quality is that \nnobody could imagine him as the next Putin. It is also clear that what the \nKremlin aims for is modernizing governance and making it more efficient. But \nmodernization doesn\u2019t mean Westernization. A more digitized bureaucracy will not\n lead to more political competition, or even stronger rule of law. The Kremlin \nwants to preserve its near total control while at the same time injecting some \ndynamism into the economy. Most commentators have strenuously highlighted that \nMr. Putin would remain in power after leaving the Kremlin, and are dismissive of\n any possible liberalizing effects of the suggested amendments. They may be \nright. In foreign policy, it\u2019s unlikely that Russia will change course. \nResisting the West is Mr. Putin\u2019s definition of Russian sovereignty. But on \ndomestic matters, the long-term consequences of the proposed changes are harder \nto predict. Surprising changes often have surprising consequences. By \nconstraining the powers of the president, empowering Parliament, and making \nhimself the ultimate power center beyond the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin would \ncreate institutional competition that is not now present. In doing so, he may \nset off the \u201cChekhov\u2019s Gun\u201d principle. As the esteemed Russian writer counseled \nyoung dramatists, \u201cIf in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, in \nthe following one it should be fired.\u201d When rulers start cosmetic changes to \nprevent real change, they should be aware that there are no guarantees things \nwill not actually change. Ivan Krastev is a contributing opinion writer, the \nchairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies, a permanent fellow at the \nInstitute for Human Sciences in Vienna and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe \nLight That Failed: A Reckoning,\u201d with Stephen Holmes.

            "full_text": " John Roberts Can Call Witnesses to Trump\u2019s Trial. \nWill He? Democratic House managers should ask the chief justice to issue \nsubpoenas for John Bolton and others. By Neal K. Katyal, Joshua A. Geltzer and \nMickey Edwards Mr. Katyal and Mr. Geltzer are law professors at Georgetown. Mr. \nEdwards is a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma. An overwhelming number\n of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, believe the Senate should \nhear from relevant witnesses and obtain documents during President Trump\u2019s \nimpeachment trial. Striking new revelations about the president\u2019s role in the \nUkraine affair, as reported from an unpublished manuscript by John Bolton, \nunderscore the need for his testimony and that of others. Yet Republican members\n of the Senate have signaled that they intend to uphold Mr. Trump\u2019s \nunprecedented decision to block all of this material. But it turns out they \ndon\u2019t get to make that choice \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts does. This isn\u2019t a \nmatter of Democrats needing four \u201cmoderate\u201d Republicans to vote for subpoenas \nand witnesses, as the Trump lawyers have been claiming. Rather, the impeachment \nrules, like all trial systems, put a large thumb on the scale of issuing \nsubpoenas and place that power within the authority of the judge, in this case \nthe chief justice. Most critically, it would take a two-thirds vote \u2014 not a \nmajority \u2014 of the Senate to overrule that. This week, Democrats can and should \nask the chief justice to issue subpoenas on his authority so that key witnesses \nof relevance like John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney appear in the Senate, and the \nSenate should subpoena all relevant documents as well. The Senate rules for \nimpeachment date back to 1868 and have been in effect since that time. They \nspecifically provide for the subpoenas of witnesses, going so far in Rule XXIV \nas to outline the specific language a subpoena must use \u2014 the \u201cform of subpoena \nto be issued on the application of the managers of the impeachment, or of the \nparty impeached, or of his counsel.\u201d As you can see, there is no \u201cSenate vote\u201d \nrequirement whatsoever in the subpoena rule. A manager can seek it on his own. \nThe rules further empower the chief justice to enforce the subpoena rule. Rule V\n says: \u201cThe presiding officer shall have power to make and issue, by himself or \nby the Secretary of the Senate, all orders, mandates, writs, and precepts \nauthorized by these rules, or by the Senate, and to make and enforce such other \nregulations and orders in the premises as the Senate may authorize or provide.\u201d \nThe presiding officer, under our Constitution, is the chief justice. As such, \nthe chief justice, as presiding officer, has the \u201cpower to make and issue, by \nhimself,\u201d subpoenas. President Trump\u2019s allies have tried to distort a separate \nrule (also still in effect), hoping that it could be stretched to say that a \nmajority of senators can override the chief justice\u2019s decision. Rule VII reads, \nin the relevant part: \u201cthe presiding officer on the trial may rule on all \nquestions of evidence including, but not limited to, questions of relevancy, \nmateriality, and redundancy of evidence and incidental questions, which ruling \nshall stand as the judgment of the Senate, unless some Member of the Senate \nshall ask that a formal vote be taken thereon, in which case it shall be \nsubmitted to the Senate for decision without debate.\u201d So President Trump\u2019s \nallies are hoping that last clause authorizes a majority of Senators to overrule\n the chief justice on matters including subpoena issuance.  But its plain text \nsays otherwise. It\u2019s carefully drawn to be about \u201cquestions of evidence\u201d: \nwhether, for example, a line of witness questioning is relevant or not. The \nissuance of a Rule XXIV subpoena, however, is not a question of evidence. In \nnormal litigation, we\u2019d call it a discovery question. Whatever one calls it \nhere, it simply isn\u2019t an evidence question: It\u2019s not about whether to admit into\n evidence a particular document, but about obtaining that document in the first \nplace; and it\u2019s not about whether a witness must answer a specific question, but\n about forcing that witness at least to show up. And that threshold question \nfalls squarely under Rule V \u2014 meaning under the chief justice\u2019s authority alone.\n And that\u2019s why the Senate, despite outlining the rules for subpoenas, never \nmade its subpoena rules governed by Rule VII. If there were any doubt, recall \nthe language of the Constitution, which orders that, in an impeachment trial of \nthe president, \u201cthe Chief Justice shall preside.\u201d To \u201cpreside\u201d is not a merely \nsymbolic role; it can mean, just as it meant during President Andrew Johnson\u2019s \nimpeachment trial, to be asked to make a range of actual rulings, including ones\n on which the chief justice is not merely the first word but also the last. \nThere\u2019s a reason that, to our knowledge, no chief justice presiding over a \npresident\u2019s impeachment trial has had to confront precisely this issue before: \nNo president has tried to hide all of the facts from Congress before. To be \nsure, previous presidents facing the prospect of impeachment \u2014 like Presidents \nNixon and Clinton \u2014 have been accused of failing to share all of the information\n sought from them. But none ever vowed, as Mr. Trump has, to continue \u201cfighting \nall the subpoenas\u201d regardless of their particular validity. Ultimately, some \naccommodation was reached in previous impeachment inquiries as to the scope of \ninformation provided \u2014 including, for Mr. Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, an \neventual agreement on witness testimony. If Chief Justice Roberts is being asked\n to answer difficult questions, it is a direct result of President Trump\u2019s \nscorched-earth approach to congressional oversight. The framers\u2019 wisdom in \ngiving this responsibility to a member of the judiciary expected to be \napolitical and impartial has never been clearer. With key Republican senators \nhaving told the American people that they prejudged the case against President \nTrump before it began and even working with Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers to build the \nvery defense for which they\u2019re supposed to be the audience, the notion that \nthey\u2019re doing the \u201cimpartial justice\u201d they\u2019ve sworn to do is very much in \nquestion. The Democrats\u2019 impeachment managers should immediately ask the chief \njustice to issue subpoenas for key witnesses and documents, insisting that the \nSenate rules make him and him alone the decision maker about whether to \u201cmake \nand enforce\u201d those subpoenas. That\u2019s his prerogative \u2014 and his responsibility, \none he can\u2019t simply shift to the senators as permitted for evidentiary questions\n under the Rule VII carve-out. What happens next won\u2019t be totally within \nDemocrats\u2019 or the chief justice\u2019s control. As Representative Adam Schiff \nacknowledged Thursday, the chief justice can decide evidence questions like \nexecutive privilege, but his determinations can be overruled by a majority of \nsenators. Likewise, when witnesses and documents arrive at the Senate, if \nquestions arise about actual evidentiary rulings \u2014 like whether Mr. Bolton or \nMr. Mulvaney can be forced to answer particular questions \u2014 a majority of \nsenators can, under Rule VII, overrule the chief justice. But the first step is \ngetting them to the Senate in the first place. There\u2019s icing on this cake. The \nspecial rules for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment trial drafted by the Senate majority \nleader, Mitch McConnell, establish certain obstacles for witness testimony, \nrequiring a deposition first and only then a Senate vote on whether to allow the\n witness to testify. But those rules apply only to a particular category of \nwitnesses \u2014 those called \u201cif the Senate agrees\u201d to them. They manifestly don\u2019t \napply when it\u2019s the chief justice who orders witnesses to appear. Mr. \nMcConnell\u2019s rules separately say that the Senate shall debate \u201cwhether it shall \nbe in order to consider and debate under the impeachment rules any motion to \nsubpoena witnesses or documents.\u201d That language cannot restrict Rule V\u2019s pre-\nexisting empowerment of the chief justice to issue subpoenas. To amend Rule V \nrequires a two-thirds vote of the Senate, something Mr. McConnell didn\u2019t get. \nThat is presumably why the rules speak only to whether the Senate should \nsubpoena witnesses or documents \u2014 but do not restrict the chief justice\u2019s \nability to issue subpoenas under his Rule V authority. And that\u2019s precisely what\n the Democrats must ask him to do \u2014 now. Neal K. Katyal (@neal_katyal), the \nauthor of \u201cImpeach: The Case Against Donald Trump,\u201d and Joshua A.

It\u2019s about how you pivot, how you move your \nshoulders, your position against your defender. Your patience. Your first step. \nThis is where his thumbprint is squarely over the W.N.B.A. \u2014 in our technique \nand how we approach the sport. A basketball rim is 10 feet above the ground. \nWhile many of us can go above the rim, we\u2019re not 6 foot 10 inches tall like \nAnthony Davis or even 6 foot 8 inches tall like LeBron James. We don\u2019t have a \nsafety net of size. Kobe\u2019s game was the same \u2014 he didn\u2019t use a safety net. It \nwas Kobe\u2019s way of playing that women 5 foot 6 inches or 6 foot 4 inches could \nstudy and put into their repertoire. When you look at the career of someone like\n Diana Taurasi, the greatest scorer the W.N.B.A. has ever seen, you see someone \nwho can get their shot anywhere on the court against any type of defense. Diana \ntook a page from Kobe\u2019s playbook. Perhaps the young women\u2019s basketball player \nKobe influenced the most was his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, who also lost her\n life in Sunday\u2019s tragedy. In recent years, it was clear that he was teaching \nher everything he knew about basketball. Gianna dreamed of playing for the UConn\n Huskies, and then for the W.N.B.A. And like everything Kobe did, he went after \nhis daughter\u2019s basketball dreams with vigor. Kobe knew that the best technical \nbasketball players are women. He wasn\u2019t asking his daughter to wait until she \nwas taller or stronger or bigger. He showed her that she, at 5 foot 10 inches, \ncould do all of this now. What it takes to succeed in basketball is the \ncommitment to be in the gym for hours and hours, practicing footwork, \nballhandling and shot technique. I can only imagine he told her that every day \nas he reminded her of her potential. I\u2019m sure he was instilling in her the same \nwork ethic that my teammates and I use while training. Kobe could work on the \nmost minuscule component of a single move for hours. Not the whole fadeaway, but\n just the plant, turn and pivot \u2014 then the knees and hips, then the shoulders \nand elbow. If his right hand was mending from a break, he would practice with \nhis left. In his last N.B.A. game \u2014 after healing from a ruptured Achilles, a \nfractured left knee and a torn rotator cuff \u2014 he still scored 60 points. He was \n37 years old at the time. No one could top him. This was one of many high points\n in his career, but there were low points, too. In a civil suit filed in 2004 \nand settled out of court in 2005, Kobe was accused of rape. He ultimately issued\n an apology to the young woman who made the allegations, saying he had come to \nunderstand that she didn\u2019t see their encounter as consensual. Still, many \nsurvivors of sexual assault and members of the public don\u2019t feel he faced proper\n accountability for what they believe happened that night. I can\u2019t say that I \nhave reconciled my thoughts about this incident with how I feel about his legacy\n of support for women\u2019s basketball. Seventeen years later, I confront this \ndissonance even as I celebrate his lasting impact on the sport I love. The \nW.N.B.A.\u2019s inaugural season was 23 years ago. Bigotry, sexism and phobias have \nshaped attitudes toward women\u2019s basketball. The maximum W.N.B.A. base salary \nrecently increased to $215,000 from $117,500. The N.B.A. salary cap, in \ncontrast, is $109.14 million. My basketball career is supported by women like \nMaya Moore who, in 2011, became the first female basketball player to sign with \nNike\u2019s Jordan brand; Nneka and Chiney Ogwumike and Layshia Clarendon, who served\n on the executive committee of the W.N.B.A. players\u2019 union and helped negotiate \na new collective bargaining agreement that increased the players\u2019 salary cap by \n30 percent; and Becky Hammon, who in 2014 became the first full-time female \nassistant coach in the N.B.A. For years, these players have spoken out in \narticles in The Players\u2019 Tribune, on sport talk shows and panels to demand more \nrespect \u2014 and fair compensation \u2014 for our sport. For that, these women deserve \nnever-ending applause and gratitude. But as in every equity movement, allies are\n needed. And Kobe was an ally. In January 2019 he visited the Oregon women\u2019s \nteam when they were in Los Angeles playing the University of Southern \nCalifornia. He became friends with Oregon\u2019s up-and-coming star Sabrina Ionescu. \nLast March he showed up with his daughter Gianna to cheer on the UConn Huskies \nin their game against Houston. What began as Kobe being a great father \norganically grew into genuine fandom for the women\u2019s game. He didn\u2019t force his \npresence or praise. Mamba was simply a fan, and that sent an important message. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no better way to learn than to watch the pros do it,\u201d Kobe said after \nhe took his daughter\u2019s club basketball team to watch the Los Angeles Sparks play\n the Las Vegas Aces in May. \u201cThe W.N.B.A. is a beautiful game to watch.\u201d In an \ninterview with CNN last week he said that the W.N.B.A. players Diana Taurasi, \nMaya Moore and Elena Delle Donne \u201ccould play in the N.B.A. right now, honestly.\u201d\n What Kobe did, consciously or not, was give male sports fans a curiosity about \nwhy an all-time N.B.A. great found so much joy and pleasure in women\u2019s \nbasketball. He spent time with W.N.B.A. players, who were his peers. He casually\n mentioned their names in interviews, tweets and Instagram posts, prompting \npeople to learn about the world-class athletes that they were late to discover. \nKobe Bryant, the scorer, the ultimate alpha, was ridiculed his entire career for\n not passing the ball enough. I hope he\u2019s remembered for passing the ball to \nwomen. Talia Caldwell (@ESOTERICTalia) is a professional women\u2019s basketball \nplayer. ",
