            "full_text": " Donald Trump Is No Dick Cheney Republican foreign \npolicy was once defined by clashing world views. Now it\u2019s defined only by \nloyalty to the president. By James Mann Mr. Mann is the author of the \nforthcoming book \u201cThe Great Rift: Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, and the Broken \nFriendship That Defined an Era.\u201d At first glance, the recent drone strike \nordered by President Trump against an Iranian general would seem to return \nRepublican foreign policy to the George W. Bush era. Several elements of the \nattack reflected the approach to the world defined by Mr. Bush\u2019s vice president,\n Dick Cheney: a belief in the efficacy of military force, the validity of pre-\nemptive attack and the determination to avoid seeking approval from \ncongressional leaders. But on closer examination, such comparisons fail. In his \nforeign policy, Mr. Trump represents something wholly new.  The president\u2019s \nrecent actions underscore the fact that the Republican Party has no guiding \nprinciples; it has only Mr. Trump, who demands loyalty to himself as its leader.\n Nor does the party leadership have senior figures with long experience in \nforeign policy who might challenge Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking. The Republican Party, \nwhich once served as home for a variety of clashing philosophies about foreign \npolicy, has lost its moorings.  Consider the party\u2019s history in recent decades \nand the contrast with where the party stands today. Over the past half-century, \nthe Republicans had been loosely split between two approaches for dealing with \nthe world. One was the traditional, alliance-centered internationalism that had \nheld sway, for example, under President George H.W. Bush. The other was the \nhawkish unilateralism of the party\u2019s neoconservatives, who had gathered strength\n during the Reagan administration. During the George W. Bush administration, \nSecretary of State Colin Powell carried forward, if imperfectly, the ideas of \ninternationalism; Vice President Cheney embraced many of the views of the \nneoconservatives. These two schools of thought came into acrimonious conflict \nover Iraq, Israel, North Korea and other issues. Now, under Mr. Trump, the \nRepublican Party has been transformed in such a way that neither \ninternationalists nor neoconservatives hold influence in the White House. Mr. \nTrump has weaved, wavered and reversed course on foreign policy based on his \nviews of the moment, and as he has, the Republicans have followed. The factional\n disputes that characterized the Bush years have been replaced by a single \nquestion: Are you loyal to President Trump or not? There is no one to challenge \nMr. Trump now. In contrast, consider the era of Mr. Cheney and Mr. Powell. Those\n two men were the most durable figures at the top of America\u2019s foreign policy \napparatus from 1988 to 2008, encompassing the end of the Cold War and its \naftermath. During those 20 years, Mr. Powell served for nine years under four \nAmerican presidents as national security adviser, chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nand secretary of state. Mr. Cheney served for a total of 12 years as secretary \nof defense and vice president. The Trump administration has nothing comparable; \nindeed, not one of the senior leaders in the current administration, including \nthe vice president, secretary of state and defense or national security adviser,\n has been involved at the top ranks in any previous administration.  Even the \nmore experienced officials Mr. Trump initially appointed to senior foreign-\npolicy jobs, like former Defense Secretary James Mattis and the former national \nsecurity adviser H.R. McMaster, had spent less previous time in senior \nWashington positions than veterans of previous Republican administrations (who \nalso included figures such as Brent Scowcroft and Robert Gates). And even these \nolder hands \u2014 the \u201cadults in the room,\u201d as they were often called \u2014 left the \nTrump administration within two years. Determined, experienced advisers can \nsometimes deflect a president\u2019s worst instincts and ideas. While doing book \nresearch in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, I ran across the astonishing\n fact that in the fall of 1988, well after the Iran-contra scandal was behind \nhim, President Reagan secretly tried to revive efforts to pay Iran for the \nrelease of American hostages in Lebanon, and to forge a new relationship with \nIran. \u201cWe have billions,\u201d Mr. Reagan told Mr. Powell, his national security \nadviser. But Mr. Powell was adamantly opposed to the idea and made sure it \ndidn\u2019t happen. (In the early 2000s, he was less strongly opposed to the idea of \ngoing to war in Iraq, the venture strongly supported by Mr. Cheney.) It is \ntempting for liberals to assume that all their opponents on the political right \nare alike, or stem from the same source \u2014 and that therefore, Dick Cheney \nsomehow led to Donald Trump. But that\u2019s not correct; Mr. Trump\u2019s origins, \noutlook and style are quite different from those of Mr. Cheney. Mr. Cheney\u2019s \nrise to power \u2014 indeed, his very persona \u2014 was based on a preoccupation with \ngovernment processes and a familiarity with the national-security bureaucracies \n(call them the \u201cdeep state\u201d) that Mr. Trump so often disdains. Mr. Cheney has at\n times voiced disapproval of some of the linchpins of Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign \npolicy, such as his dealings with Russia and North Korea. John Bolton, Mr. \nTrump\u2019s former national security adviser, represented the last link in the top \nranks of the Trump administration to the determinedly hawkish policies advocated\n by Mr. Cheney. As for Mr. Powell, it is at this point hard even to recall how \nor why he identified himself as a Republican. Yet at the time the Cold War was \nending, the Democrats were calling for a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d that included \nsubstantial cuts in the defense budget, and Mr. Powell, working closely with Mr.\n Cheney, labored hard, and for the most part successfully, to resist those \nefforts. Mr. Powell\u2019s eventual alienation from the Republican Party was a result\n of the same forces and dynamics that would eventually propel the rise of Mr. \nTrump: nativism and hostility toward immigrants and racial minorities. When Mr. \nPowell appeared before the Republican National Convention in 1996, he made a \nplea for diversity and tolerance. \u201cThe Hispanic immigrant who became a citizen \nyesterday must be as precious as a Mayflower descendant,\u201d he told the delegates \nthen. That speech was greeted by a smattering of boos. In 2008, when Mr. Powell \nannounced he could not support the Republican presidential nominee (even though \nit was his old friend John McCain), Mr. Powell specifically cited the mood of \nRepublicans who had claimed that Senator McCain\u2019s opponent, Barack Obama, was a \nMuslim. The Trump Republicans long ago abandoned Mr. Powell and virtually \neverything he stood for \u2014 and while it may seem less obvious right now, they \nhave cut loose from Cheneyism, too. We can see the party\u2019s absence of ideas or \nstrategy in the current policies on the Middle East and North Korea.  The drone \nstrike came alongside Mr. Trump\u2019s purported effort to lessen America\u2019s \ninvolvement in the Middle East. His personal diplomacy with Kim Jong-un of North\n Korea and President Vladimir Putin of Russia might appear to be in line with \nMr. Powell\u2019s emphasis on diplomacy \u2014 but under Mr. Trump, what has counted so \nfar is only the word \u201cpersonal,\u201d not the diplomacy. As a result, the Republicans\n are left with no past and no ideas, merely a single man and his vagaries. James\n Mann is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Great Rift: Dick Cheney, Colin \nPowell, and the Broken Friendship That Defined an Era.\u201d ",

            "full_text": " F.D.R. Got It. Most Democrats Don\u2019t. Government needs\n to be seen, not hidden. By David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist In January 1937, \nnear the end of Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s first term as president, Life magazine \npublished a map of the United States spread over two full pages. The headline \nread: \u201cWhat President Roosevelt Did to the Map of the U.S. in Four Years with \n$6,500,000,000.\u201d Scattered around the map were dozens of small drawings, each \nshowing a project funded by Roosevelt\u2019s stimulus program. They included the \nTriborough Bridge, Manhattan\u2019s Midtown tunnels, bridges on Cape Cod, schools in \nSouth Carolina, dorms at Texas Tech, the Kansas City Civic Auditorium, the Los \nAngeles Aqueduct and the Grand Coulee Dam. A few of the drawings summarized \nbroader projects, like \u201c2 U.S. aircraft carriers\u201d and \u201c120 U.S. airports.\u201d Since\n taking office in 1933, Roosevelt hadn\u2019t only rescued the country from the Great\n Depression. He had made sure that the country knew he had rescued it. His \nprojects were big, tangible and unmistakably the work of the federal government.\n The projects changed how Americans thought about government. In recent decades,\n Democrats have too often forgotten this lesson. They have created \ntechnocratically elegant policies that quietly improve people\u2019s lives, like tax \ncredits or insurance subsidies. The problem with this approach is that it does \nlittle to build popular support for government action.  Put it this way: How \nmany projects can you name from Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus program? Can you name \nany project or agency that Bill Clinton created? Clinton and, even more so, \nObama, were successful presidents. Yet their administrations were still hindered\n by a certain na\u00efvet\u00e9. Officials sometimes tried to perfect policy design while \nproudly ignoring political impact, as if the two could be separated in a \ndemocracy. Republicans don\u2019t suffer from this na\u00efvet\u00e9. Again and again, they \npush policies meant to affect politics, such as campaign-finance deregulation, \nvoting restrictions and labor-union constraints. Republicans understand a \nconcept that political scientists refer to as \u201cpolicy feedback\u201d \u2014 namely, that \npolicy can influence politics in ways that make future policy changes more or \nless likely. In the last several years, policy feedback has finally started \ngetting more attention in progressive circles. And one of the politicians who\u2019s \nmost interested in the subject happens to be running for president: Elizabeth \nWarren. While the rest of the Obama administration was pushing a financial-\nreform bill that was impenetrable to most Americans, Warren insisted on an idea \nwith Rooseveltian simplicity. It became the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, which tries to protect people from being cheated or deceived by banks. \nWarren\u2019s presidential agenda has several other easily understandable ideas, like\n a $200-a-month increase in Social Security benefits, a price reduction for \ninsulin and other popular drugs, the cancellation of up to $50,000 in student \ndebt and a wealth tax. During a recent interview with her, I mentioned that she \nseemed to believe that bigger ideas were sometimes easier to accomplish than \nmore modest ones. \u201cI do,\u201d she replied. Big ideas can inspire people; tax credits\n do not. I don\u2019t agree with all of Warren\u2019s ideas (see: Medicare for All), but I\n think she is onto something important here. Creating a new era of progressive \nchange \u2014 to take on problems like climate change and extreme inequality \u2014 \ndepends on persuading more Americans that government is a force for good.  The \nbest way to improve the image of government is not through soaring speeches by \npoliticians. It\u2019s through a version of the old journalism clich\u00e9: Show, don\u2019t \ntell. \u201cYou want people to be able to see the way government is helping them,\u201d \nJacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist, says, \u201cand have a stake in defending \nit.\u201d Right now, the government often does the opposite. Many programs are hidden\n in the tax code, as Suzanne Mettler of Cornell explained in her book \u201cThe \nSubmerged State.\u201d Upper-middle-class families receive thousands of dollars from \nthe mortgage-interest deduction without thinking of it as a government benefit. \nLower-income families sign up for the earned-income tax credit by visiting a \ntax-preparation company, which can make the benefit appear to come from H&R \nBlock, rather than Uncle Sam. The Obama stimulus remains the canonical example. \nOut of a well-intended desire to get Americans to spend more of their stimulus \ntax cut, the administration snuck the money into people\u2019s paychecks, rather than\n sending one-time checks (as George W. Bush had done in 2001) that families \nmight have saved. Economically, it worked. Spending rose, helping to end the \nfinancial crisis. Politically, it was a dud. Many Americans gave Obama little \ncredit and voted for Republicans in the 2010 midterms, virtually killing his \nlarger legislative agenda. The stealth tax cut was a smart idea, but it needed \nto be paired with more salient forms of stimulus, like those projects on the \nLife Magazine map. One reason that modern-day Democrats have pursued \ntechnocratic policies is the desire to win some Republican votes in Congress. \nYet those votes almost never materialize. Today\u2019s Republican Party is too \nradical. Democrats are then left defending complex programs \u2014 like Obamacare\u2019s \nprivate exchanges \u2014 rather than simple, popular ones \u2014 like an expanded \nMedicare, open to all who want it. The next Democratic president, whoever it is,\n shouldn\u2019t repeat this mistake. In climate policy, this would mean putting more \nemphasis on a green-jobs program than on a hated carbon tax. In education, it \ncould mean creating a \u201cpublic option\u201d for pre-K. In every area, it also means \nmaking sure that government functions well. Public policy really does have the \npotential to shape public opinion. Years after Roosevelt created Social \nSecurity, one of his advisers suggested to him that funding it with a new tax \u2014 \nthe payroll tax \u2014 had been a mistake during the Depression. Roosevelt responded \nthat the tax transformed the politics of Social Security, making it feel like a \nsavings program rather than welfare. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right on the economics,\u201d \nRoosevelt told the adviser. But \u201cthose taxes aren\u2019t a matter of economics \u2014 \nthey\u2019re straight politics.\u201d As the president explained, \u201cWith those taxes in \nthere, no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program.\u201d  ",
