The antics of Farage and his fellow clowns in the European parliament should have made any self respecting Brit ashamed. I actually sense there is some embarrassment even among those British friends who voted to leave. They get very defensive and angry if you ask them pointed questions; start trotting out irrational answers about personalities and myths that have no basis in fact. Britain is going to be a spiritually shrunken place and maybe even territorially.",

            "comment_body": "In 1981 while  doing research in the UK I visited my grandparents families in County Mayo, Ireland. The poverty was heartbreaking. The floor in their cottage consisted of stones placed on dirt and the kettle to make tea was heated over a peat fire in the hearth. As we were leaving my wife whispered to me that it was lucky for me that my ancestors had left.\nIn 1999 while my daughter was spending a semester abroad at University College Cork, I revisited my Irish family. The old cottage was now an outbuilding and the family was now housed in a new modern house that would make most American farm families proud. My cousin Mary said it was all due to Ireland having joined the EU. \nNow the GDP per capita in Ireland is $78,000, in the USA it is $65,000 and in the UK it is $41,000. It is no wonder that the Irish Vice President of the EU Parliament told Lafarge to put away his British flag and be gone. I enjoyed my several periods of living in the U.K. and fear for what the pro-Brexit voters have inflicted on their country just as I am fearful of what the pro Trump voters have inflicted on our country.",

            "comment_body": "Most of what Mr. Cohen celebrates in the EU experiment was achieved by 1990.  It has largely been downhill ever since.\n\nThe paragraph regarding the Bosnian war twists the tale.  Europe was supposed to be mature enough, strong enough, responsible enough, to end the ethnic cleansing and killing on European soil.  But it didn't happen.  European diplomats wrung their hands, demoaning the intransigence of Serb, Croat and Bosniak.  Dutch soldiers in their cowardice allowed 8,000 Muslim men and boys to be butchered.  The European Union saved not a single soul;  it did not lay bad history to rest, it perpetuated bad history.  Only America put a stop to the killing.\n\nIn the last decade the European Union via the European Central Bank and the Euro, destroyed the economic and social fabric of Greece, Spain, and Portugal, consigning millions of Southern Europeans to austerity and destitution, to protect German prosperity.  EU core institutions are insulated from and impervious to change by European voters.  It is an elite exercise.  Government of the 20%, by the 20%, for the 20%.  Ask any yellow-vested French citizen.\n\nEurope has no core military institution of its own, and refuses to pay its fair share toward NATO.  The Germans fund NordStream, so they can buy gas directly from Putin, allowing Putin to cut off gas to Ukraine in the winter anytime Putin feels like it.  \n\nThe E.U. is ill.  Perhaps terminally.  The rest is sentimental malarkey.",

They're hooked on being holier than though. They liked hurting other people but the only people left under their control were in their own nation.\n\nMuch the same thing is happening in Trumps America. With out slaves to whip or Indians to shoot they simply train the guns and the techniques on other targets.\n\nHistory repeats itself because the drive to power is not simply wrong it's rewarding. It's a dysfunctional fix , a thrill, for the people who have been doing it all along.\n\nOur own elite in our own Imperial Capital is pretty hooked on it's own sort of corrupton. Rest assured if they must damage the nation to keep it going they have shown that they will.\n\nWe can't throw the first stone from America but if we're honest we can look at the British easily as if in a mirror and say \"Hey, I've seen this story before?\"",

            "comment_body": "Why did it happen?  There was always an anti Europe strain in England, especially in the Tory Party, but that element surged dramatically after the admission of Eastern European countries and the promotion of free movement throughout the EU.  Angela Merkel, as a leading member of the Christian Democrats, had in 2005 warned of the dangers of uncontrolled immigration but as Chancellor later refused to agree to any restrictions.  Who gained the most from the admission of the Eastern European countries?  Germany, by far, both economically as German exporters gained access to large nearby markets, and politically, as EU membership tied those countries closer to the West, enhancing the buffer between Germany and Russia.  Who absorbed the costs of Eastern expansion?  The U.K., as immigration surged far beyond pre-expansion estimates.  The UK had the most open and flexible labor market and a relatively generous welfare system.  In addition, the English language is the most widely spoken second language all over the world.  When David Cameron went to Merkel and asked for relief in 2016 prior to the referendum, she prioritized German interests in Eastern Europe, where politicians had a strong desire to retain freedom of movement, over British interests in gaining breathing room. It turned out to be a mistake, as the EU loses economically, politically and militarily from Brexit.  Brexit cannot be blamed solely on a few \u201clittle England\u201d flag waving nationalists.",

Your and my parents generation fought a difficult war to weed this thinking out of our midst, but it keeps coming back.  \n\nMaybe we are going to have to keep fighting this violent group every few generations.\n\nNot a happy thought.  Maybe climate change will kill off enough of the human race to give our earth a second chance.",

Hearing it roaring, the mouse remembers its clemency and frees it by gnawing through the ropes. \n\nTo me, the moral of the story is that if adversaries can become friends through mercy and mutual understanding, both can benefit, particularly during turbulent times.\n\nThe people of Britain thought themselves a lion and the rest of the EU a mouse with whom they could easily dispense.\n\nAs in the fable, however, there may come a time when Britain will find itself ensnared, but will the mouse return to help after its betrayal?",

It can feel exhilarating to the person saying it, crushing to the person hearing it and envy inducing to anyone learning of it (who hasn't been following Harry and Meghan's royal departure obsessively?). Quitting can be an impulsive act of emancipation or a more tortured step toward a better life. But if there\u2019s a common thread in these personal stories, it\u2019s this: Very few people quit without good reason, and even fewer go back[.]\u201d\n\nThis is worth thinking about before making a judgement on the people in England who voted to quit the EU. \n\nInterestingly, the comments in Cohen\u2019s article overwhelmingly are against quitting while the comments in Strizemien\u2019s article are overwhelmingly in favor of it.",

This merely explains why each of the different constituants of the EU continue to feel a stronger positive sense of belonging than many in the UK.

These are very tangiable and visible events to all generations of each of those constiuent parts. The UK joined the EEC for purely economic reasons after the Post War boom was heading for the buffers as the 1970s dawned. However on joining the EEC in 1973 the UK industrial collapse continued through the decade as Germany and France had already formed the EEC laws in favour of their inudstries, including the argricultural rules that has formed the backbone of the anti-EU backlash in the UK ever since. It wasnt until the Financial deregulation of the 1980s and dismantling of the Trade Unions did the British economy pick up and that was aligned with the US not the EEC.",

In some countries like the US there is a political party that welcomes this. In others they see no reason to basically upended their entire culture to accommodate people they share almost nothing with and in fact, aren\u2019t particularly keen to adopt failed and often undemocratic new comers. This perceived existential threat has given rise to trump and national movements in many places. On a planet over run with people and real and potential immigrants the brits like much of the EU, saw it\u2019s out of date immigration laws as a threat to its very existence as a country.

What was cited as the most important benefit?-  the ability to make our own laws once more (when could we not in the last 47 years) which would make us great again.  Complete delusion.  Some of the material came from Sunderland where the Nissan plant is located which provides circa 7,000 direct jobs and possibly a further 30,000 to 40,000 in support industries.  It would be no surprise if Nissan decided to pull out as its original rationale was to export to Europe unfettered.  Part of me hopes that they do for Sunderland was the first area to declare with a massive majority to Leave but in truth if we are to prosper at all we will need all the help we can get and so I hope they find a way to stay.

The rapid introduction of a different, alien culture has profoundly affected England, and people want some limits. \n\nIn the USA, our laws provide for ample numbers of immigrants through legal processes.

I just went through the last week of opinion pieces (I don't want to spend my whole day on this so I limited this to a week) and there are 3 distinctly negative pieces on Sanders this past week. None are positive. There seems to be a concerted effort to plaster the NYT with negative Sanders opinion pieces. The 3 on Biden this past week have been positive. Is anyone at the NYT aware of their collective \"foot\" on this negative Sanders scale? Would Mr. Baquet please give all this \"Bernie bashing\" a rest? It seems like 2016 all over again.",

This is how Trump got elected.\n\nThe only candidates I believe have heard me are Bernie & Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIt's appalling conservative Democrats are painting this dire - &  false - picture of Bernie supporters.\n\nWe're nothing like this.\n\nDuring the 2016 primary, HRC & her surrogates viciously attacked Bernie & his supporters like Bernie was a white supremacist or Proud Boy.\n\nAs the nominee, Hillary never reached out to Bernie supporters.  Never.  Even though she needed us badly. \n\nShe continues to slam us now. \n\nKeep insulting us, Hillary.  See where that gets you.\n\nUnfairness & divisive behavior by the DNC caused this divisive mess.  The Clintons, Tom Perez & DNC are still struggling to keep their stranglehold on Democratic voters.\n\nTheir smears against us just reinforces support for Bernie. \n\nRemember... you folks reap what you sow.",

I have supported Bernie for years, met many fellow supporters, and they are wonderful, dedicated people.  They care about issues like health care, minimum wage, the environment.  The columns and articles that the Times is printing are verging on fantasy.  The writers perpetuate tropes.  If the Times just totaled up the number of readers who disagree with Bret Stephens, just from today's column, they would realize that he doesn't belong on their editorial pages.",

For them, they gambled and lost. They're not never Trumpers, MAGAs, or any other name brand. They're disappointed. They're going bankrupt from medical debt too, just like the rest of us. Sanders supporters understand that.\n\nIts the season for painting any opposition with a broad brush, for assigning divisions, for labeling with generalities, for pigeonholing every living, voting soul as a this or that. Its what pundits do. The reality is far different. As a population our similarities and circumstances outweigh our differences. Our humanity is our oversoul, the hub of our political wheel. There's no division in that view, only shades of colors RYB defended and protected by a notorious RBG. \n\nIts no more cultish than a golden rule that spans a myriad of spiritual systems current or lost, or the idea of a democracy that levels the playing field regardless of one's station in life. Reducing the majesty of those all encompassing hopes for  healthy management of human affairs to the chair throwers is unfair.",

Don't count yourself \"woke\" if you saw that misogyny in the MAGA crowd but closed your eyes to it in many of Bernie's supporters in the last election.",

Just for asking these technical questions, I was pretty much assaulted.  Not to speak of the vicious lies and exaggerations they spread about Clinton. Plus, the fact that Sanders waited so long to endorse Clinton only stoked the fires of the anti-Clinton Bernie Bros. Compare that with the way Clinton acted when Obama was selected as the nominee: she immediately endorsed him wholeheartedly, without stoking resentment in her supporters. Finally, I have witnessed Sanders' own impatience towards anyone who challenges him and condescending tone towards women in so many interviews.  Nevertheless, despite the fact I do not personally like him, I will still vote for him if he were the nominee. Hope Bernie Bros can say the same of other nominees.",

I did so because, as much as I disliked her, I thought she would be a thousand times better for this country than Donald Trump would ever be - even if he were to get brain and personality transplants. Many \"Bernie bros\" did not. Some stayed home on election day. Some actually crossed party lines and voted for Trump. A few swarmed me on-line for \"breaking faith\" with Bernie. I hold those folks responsible for the fact that Trump is president (with a little \"p\") today. And I  won't support Bernie this time around because of it. We don't need a progressive version of Trump.",

As a target of some of that bullying behavior in 2016, I have to agree with Bret.  Acquaintances of mine engaged in an online disinformation campaign against Secy. Clinton, and attacked and ridiculed anyone who presented the facts and disagreed. As a former journalist, I fact check everything.\n Then the expressed misogyny of the Bernie Bros representing their candidate convinced me Bernie was complicit in their behavior. \n I think he would be a disaster as President because he can't get along with the people he needs to support him to be an effective leader. I also think his agenda would be an unworkable disaster for the country. He's a selfish man who has done nothing for the Democratic party and will do nothing to help down ballot candidates because that's what he did in 2016.\nLastly a recent poll reported that more than 50 percent of his current supporters said they wouldn't  vote for the Democratic nominee if it wasn't Bernie!  Therefore, I concluded that he and they are as dangerous in much the same way as the current occupant of the White House (I was prepared to hold my nose and vote blue for any Democratic nominee including Toxic Bernie).  \nHillary is right, no one in the Senate likes him. Why would we want another mean bully in the White House?",

Some go into law enforcement. Some others decide to go into the Mob and a life of crime. But there is truly little in their background or upbringing that separates them.

It may be Trump. Like the kid who becomes a cop in the movie, in their minds the choice was binary to begin with and, given a second chance to choose, the other choice is the obvious one. \n\nThat is why they voted for Trump or stayed home in 2016.

I hade the unsettling experience of seeing a seethingly nasty and snarky Instagram comment on a Rosario Dawson post by someone I know in real life who is an ardent Bernie Bro. Her post was about her love for Corey Booker and the comment by Bernie bro was just hate filled venom about Mr. Booker. Why? I couldn't fathom what would generate the need to thumb type (which takes time) such unnecessary nastiness. I imagined the level of hounding that must constantly occur by this person and so many like him. It is \"SAD\" when the most \"progressive\" end of the Democrat Party devolves into regressive trolling, trolling no different than from Trump supporters.",

Trump and Sanders supporters are not reliably civil in the opinions they express, and even less so in how they express them.  \n\nBut then robust, wide open debate - the goal of the First Amendment, according to the Supreme Court's 1964 opinion in New York Times v. Sullivan - is not a prescription for civility.  Civilized discourses are among the devices of manipulation especially favored by those in power.  They help quell and suppress the restive masses.  So if you are restive why not reject civility in favor of something more - well, more robust and wide open?  That is what Trump and Sanders supporters obviously suppose.  It makes good sense.  Otherwise, they would remain at the mercy of the gatekeepers, like Stephens and Senator Boxer and the New York Times.\n\nEric Hoffer was often wrong, and perhaps sometimes even a fool.  I heard him exclaim once, referring to the dissidents of the late 1960s, that \"what they want is a boss.\"  Nothing could have been further from the truth.  What they wanted was a provocateur, an exemplar of the art of thinking as they pleased and speaking as they thought.  Anyone but a figure of authority.\n\nAnd that is the role played by Trump and Sanders.  Played more successfully by Trump than by Sanders, I suspect, but time will tell.",

The DNC actively worked for Clinton's campaign in 2016. Debate moderators pick sides in a he-said-she-said accusation. There had been an outright media blackout on Sanders until he started approaching frontrunner status, and now that he is here, more of the coverage is about his supporters *ahem* than his policies.\n\nThe comparison to Trump supporters is a joke. Look at a Bernie Sanders rally vs. a Donald Trump rally. In one instance, you see people looking to their left and right, supporting people who look nothing like them and come from an entirely different walk of life. These are the people you vilify. In the other, you see crowds of people screaming \"lock her up\" and \"send them back.\" These are the people you fail to mention.\n\nThis entire article is embarrassing and comes off as whining at best.",

The results at Emerson Polling shows that, yes, only 53% of Sanders supporters will commit now to voting for the eventual Democratic nominee if Sanders doesn't win.

That leaves 16% of Sanders supporters who say they will vote for Mr. Sanders only.\n\nEven that I suspect is high.  In the event that Sanders does not become the nominee, I anticipate even more of his supporters will vote for the Democrat as Mr. Sanders energetically exhorts his supporters to vote against Trump and exhibitions of the same vicious and provocative behaviors by Trump on the campaign trail make the news night after night.\n\nSanders supporters are very devoted to their candidate, but after 3 years of Trump, it's doubtful that more than a very small percentage of them think there's no difference between Trump and the other front running Democratic candidates.

And, being the frontrunner, that's why the party needs to get behind him, as they have traditionally done for all frontrunners in the past. \n\nBut they won't, and the reasons is because it is the party, not the Bernie bros, who actually would prefer four more years of Trump over any substantial change to the economic status quo.\n\nJust look at how corrupt the Republicans in Congressare are, and realize the Democrats are at least half as corrupt as that. That's the reality. Thats why the people want Bernie.",

People were sore in those days about Hillary's superdelegates who declared themselves for her in the early days before the campaigns were really launched. And what a bunch of priviligees they were too, Bret, and I ought to know having come from those folk. So everyone knew Barbara was strictly in Hillary's camp and that her intentions were not generous in that situation. More of a \"let me handle this.\" The brandishing of furniture was not meant to menace her or anyone else. It was more of a \"we're staying right here\" gesture. Had I been there, I'd have gone up and in my best prep school tones would have told her she should know better than to rub outsiders' noses in it, to condescend to anyone after the way Hillary behaved and how the caucus organizers were treating them.  If you treat serious constituents like they're not legit, well, you know the old self fulfilling prophecy thing, it means you're treating their leader like an nonperson - as you're doing here in another attempt at relevance - and at some point they'll start acting like people do when they have a right to be there and they've had it with being marginalized. ps I'm for Warren",

This anger is manifested as extreme rudeness and nastiness when interacting with Democrats of the center-left wing. The only thing that will calm them down is getting corporate money out of politics. That is their focus, not stopping right wing fascism from destroying democracy which is the main focus of the center-left.",

Men in white collared shirts and ties.  Women in dresses. And they behaved like they were in church.  Respectful, quiet, and attentive to the words being spoken.  No cattcalls, no chairs being lifted overhead, no  inappropriate language.  Then you look at political rallies today.  It's like a mob.  But the real problem is the people who attend these events don't see themselves that way.   Trump rally goers see themselves as the most patriotic people ever.  The problem with the Democrats is they have no leader like MLK.  If you are going to go high to their low, go high.  Don't just go one step on the ladder above the Trump rally mobs.  If you want to be better, behave like it.  The message King delivered was we can get this done if we stick together and stay in control.  We, America, needs someone to lead us.  What I don't understand is why no one has?  Why is it so hard? MLK was incredibly successful.  He showed us how to get it done.  And we failed to listen and follow.",

If this was a true cult of personality (as the Cult of Trump may well be), then why is it that when Saint Bernie himself attempted to pivot after the defeat at the hands of Clinton to being a good soldier for the party, his followers were having none of it. Go back and look at the footage of Bernie trying to rally his troops in their meeting on the first day of the 2016 convention. When he says that they must now support the nominee, work to elect Hillary, the crowd pushes back. No we won't, they tell him. That's not following your leader mindlessly. Bernie has been wrongly condemned for not doing what he could to support Hillary in the final phase of the campaign. The record shows he actually did quite a lot. The problem is rather that he doesn't control his supporters. When Barbara Boxer in this piece says \"When you boo me, you're booing Bernie,\" she wrongly thinks that his supporters are with him because he is Bernie and thus that their allegiance is transferable, as if this is all about a personality. Bernie is only Bernie because he consistently gives voice to what his supporters want to hear. The minute he deviates from that line, he loses them. You may groan at the \"our revolution\" rhetoric, but the \"people powered\" stuff is right in one respect. Bernie is a vehicle. His followers will only stay on board if they want to go where he is leading.",

That seems to be Joe Biden---he wants to pick physical fights with people at his own rallies.",

They continue to spew vitriol at Hilary as if she were running again.  I think it's time for Sanders to take away the Kool-Aid many of his loyalists are drinking by stressing to them how important it is for them to vote for whichever Democrat wins the nomination.  He has publicly said that, but he needs to continue to say that.  It would help his credibility with the rest of us in case he does win the nomination.",

Hillary saw the 2016 election as a fundraising challenge, in the misbelief that having the biggest war chest is the safest route to victory. Bernie (who happens to be a terrific fundraiser) views politics as a battle of ideas and ideals.   While he was promoting his platform to crowds of up to 20,000 or more, Hilary was having quiet fundraising teas and cocktail parties with selected elite 'limousine' democrats. Her lackluster campaign resulted in Trump's victory. To beat Trump in 2020, we need a fired-up street fighter, someone who recognizes the issues of the day, can clearly articulate solutions, and has a proven track record of appealing to a wide and diverse electorate. Bernie fits that bill. And, yes, \"Bernie Bros\" (whatever that means) may seem angry at times; but if you don't understand why you're living on some other planet, Bret.

This, despite the fact that Bernie\u2019s donor and volunteer bases are the largest, youngest, and most diverse of any of the candidates, and that he polls better among women under 40 than any of the others candidates \n\nMoreover, the notion that repeating the same mistakes they've been making since 1984, that going with the \"safe\" establishment candidate (e.g., Biden) will magically become the winning strategy for the Dems -- how's John Kerry working out for you? or Michael Dukakis? or Hillary Clinton? -- is belied by the facts, by history, and by common sense.\n\nSadly, as became painfully clear in 2016, the neoliberal Democratic establishment and its corporate overlords would seem to prefer losing to Trump over giving a self-described democratic-socialist the keys the to the White House.\n\nSo we need to be clear: what's really motivating the Stop Bernie movement is not fear that he _can't_ win, it's fear that he _will_ win.",

I understand Bernie's style in the context of the local politics in the coastal university town where I completed a graduate degree. His message is loud and simple. He has crafted an identity for himself and his followers around Democratic Socialism. He speaks to the politics of envy couched in the idealism of youth borrowing techniques from the 1930's and the 1960's. One of social media's failings that benefits Bernie greatly is that access to nearly unlimited interconnectivity has allowed 1960's style ideologies and enthusiasms to be revisited with all the side-effects that ultimately doomed the New Left: quasi-religious purity tests, identity politics, and neglect for true outreach to the underserved, poor communities that in theory Bernie champions. Social media have thus transformed Bernie from a louder version of a university town politician into a national figure. His followers also mimic the evolution of 1960's politics into 1970's cult behavior and in a sense his most aggressive followers are the counterpoint to the cult of Trump. Those of us in neither cult run the risk of being collateral damage in the 2020 election when these two cults overindulge their drinking of their respective Kool-aids. Ancient Greek philosophers warned of the dangers to democracy from such low-information voters and this country may relearn their lessons the hard way.",

Described myself as 75, life long leftist Dem who ran in a Congressional Primary in 1974 proposing national health insurance, and now am in the midst of on-going treatment for aggressive prostate cancer.  Offered that I and others in serious medical situations might have pause at seeing our existing supports swept away at a stroke. Suggested more graduated approaches might be more practical and actually politically  possible.  What I got was ad hominem responses.  One guy offered I had no right to call myself a Democrat, another calculated that I had lived long enough anyway.  None responded to my point that wiping out every medical plan in the country might be unsettling to more than a few voters. I understand Senator Boxer\u2019s observation that some people cannot stand one word of deviation from what they want to hear.  The closed mind is always terrifying.  And oh by the way, I will vote for Bernie.  I think he can generate turnout in under 35 group, and is best positioned to defuse the threat of the Green Party in battleground states.  I think he has a path to victory.",

These \"bros\" (because they are often young and male) shut people out of reasonable conversation and debate, and aggressively attack those who even moderately disagree with them. I am liberal and agree with Sanders on many things, but we have to call this out for what it is. Their tactics leave women, minorities, and religious people out of the conversation and debase their opinions, and even ridicule more moderate liberals for not fully embracing Sanders. They claim that they know best, but refuse to compromise or even consider other points of view other than becoming a democratic socialist government (in a country that has never been particularly apt to it). It's not so much an issue with Bernie, but many of his supporters are taking on dangerous mindsets and degrading the humanity of those who disagree with him. It's sad to see that so many people who claim to be \"progressive\", are still sexist and brash. Empathy is needed on both sides if we are ever to become a stronger nation, and it scares me to see the left even begin to take on the extremist mindsets. I know my generation will play a large part in shaping the political future, but we have to move forward with respect for one another and at the very least, listen, and see the humanity in those who disagree with us.",

This is worrisome, and Bernie\u2019s seeming non-chalant way of handling them doesn\u2019t inspire confidence, neither as a presidential candidate, nor especially as president.

We can't afford our medicine and health care, so we suffer and die. We are working 2 to 3 minimum wage jobs, no benefits, we can't afford food and rent. We are homeless, we die. We are depressed from a system that is crushing us, we can't get counseling and anti depressants because of lack of affordable healthcare, so we turn to opiods and heroine, we overdose, we die. The system is producing terrible jobs, there is a lack of opportunity due to corruption and nepotism. America is literally killing the working poor, it's not an exaggeration, excuse us for feeling angry, we are suffering tremendously. Bernie is our only beacon of hope, no other politician cares about us. people are being murdered by a corrupt rigged system. Life expectancy has been plummeting until recently. We are dying, establishment politicians will not save us, it is a matter of life and death. Bernie is life, the rest is a vote for more death",

There was, to say the least, much generational vituperation between the kids and their parents, who, in total fairness, had shouldered far greater loss and suffering in WWII, not to mention the Korean war.\n\nMcGovern ultimately got the Democratic party's nomination.\nDespite his floridly obvious character flaws, Nixon won 49 of 50 states in the 1972 election, and got 18 million more votes than McGovern, mainly because McGovern was widely seen as too far \"left.\"\n\nSorry, but Bernie's trolls are not the problem.",

All of the plans are so vague there has been no estimate of their costs by experts, just wild guess by the candidates. \n\n3.

But they are right that ordinary civility has become a fool\u2019s errand or a con game, with a fool on one side of the civil exchange and a con man on the other. What could be more civil than the statements issued by Lamar Alexander and Lisa Murkowski explaining their refusal to vote for witnesses to be called in the impeachment trial?  But what could have been more destructive to the future of democracy in America? Murkowski was deeply disturbed by Adam Schiff\u2019s quoting of a CBS report of a threat issued by the Trump administration. She apparently found that uncivil. But with utmost dignity today, she helped set fire to the constitution. It\u2019s that sort of thing that has the Bernie Bros in a rage. I certainly do not endorse their nastiness, and I certainly don\u2019t support Bernie. But civility right now is a mask the Republicans wear as they back the nastiest man ever elected to the presidency. The message of that sort of civility is: This is a Republic. Why should we be so impolite as to try to keep it?",

Are you willing to hold your nose and vote for a candidate you may even actively dislike because it is STILL a better option than the tacky gilded brute we currently have? Are you willing to face up to the untold horrors that will come, that millions of people will continue to face, that our burning planet faces, and go explain to folks why you just couldn't bring yourself to vote for the eventual Democratic candidate because, darn it, it just wasn't who you wanted? How about you go explain to the little kids in cages why you just couldn't bring yourself to vote for the Democratic candidate because they didn't pass your purity test? \n\nThis is on us, folks. We can whine and whinge about the grand evildoers all we want (and they are really, unbelievably, truly awful) but until we take real action, it doesn't mean anything. We could and should have won the last election. WE lost it. \n\nNow: go register to vote. And then get out there no matter what, hold your nose, and vote blue, no matter what.",

The next time one of the R/C/E Axis mentions the \"Liberal\" media, we should ask them to identify that media, because there isn't much of one. How much media is actually owned or managed by Liberals? Any? That lie is what the R/C/E Axis has been working on for years. So also are all their other lies about Liberals and now Constitutionalists and Patriots. The next time the R/C/E Axis claims someone is not a Patriot, stand up and salute. The next time they claim they are Patriots, ask them to point to the Patriots because having a gun does not make you a Patriot, or a flag whether on your shoulder or around your shoulders.

Remind me, was it Obama who addressed prison reform or was that Trump. Millions more Americans are on company provided healthcare, millions more that are not dependent on government assistance, many are opening their own business, many more working, more job openings than people looking for jobs. There's no absolute, but many more people are benefiting from this President than they were under Obama, it's a blatant lie to say only the rich are benefiting. you will lose in November and will lose big!",

'I will transmit this information to Vladimir.'\u201d \n\nObama offered Putin a quid pro quo. He said he would be more flexible on missile defense if Putin did not make missile defense an issue before the election.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Rep. Adam Schiff call for Obama\u2019s impeachment?",

Lessons that for 50 plus years had been buried under the rubble of the United States which has reached it apex and is on the way down. Most of the leadership in both parties gave their tacit agreement, shaking their affirmative heads with a sigh. President came in and said, \"Hold it!\" We can get out jobs back! We can protect our borders while, at the same time, bringing in immigrants who can help grow that weakened American Dream. We can put all our people back to work--Hispanics, African-Americans, women, men, and we can do it by cutting taxes, cutting regulations---freeing the citizenry to find their own path. In other words--FREEDOM!  We can cancel bad agreements like NAFTA and redo it with USMCA! The same with China trade! We can fight climate change with smart, common sense approaches that do not kill us all with draconian measures. We can NOT get in every war in the world. We can get other countries to pay their \"fair share\" freeing up the Countries' resources to help our people. Maureen Dowd is still old school Leftist! Trump is kicking that Spector in the pants and creating a better life for more than the U.S. ---- for the world!!",

Clinton's platform was virtually identical to Bush Sr.'s; he won because he was more charismatic and because Bush DID raise taxes.  Obama supported the bank bailout and expansion and escalation of wars in Muslim countries. And now we have Trump and his pro-monarchy defenders.  We have his angry groper and rapist judges.   We have his neo-Nazi followers and his praise for them.  We have a huge spike in hate crimes and xenophobia.  Isn't it time to support a true Democrat?  A supporter of New Deal programs for working class and middle class and poor Americans.  A RETURN ---  that's right, it's not NEW -- to free college? To a supporter of parity with the rest of the world in terms of affordable health care?  To leadership on environmental issues?

Trumpism is a middle finger to all that liberalism stands for, including democracy.  I fear that this is only the beginning.  For example, according to Pew polls 40% of Americans are anti-abortion.  They have the judges and now that there essentially is no legislative branch, its likely that abortion will become illegal.  The only modicum of hope is that Trumpism is relatively anti-war compared to historically similar fascist regimes like the NSDAP, so I don't see us invading a country anytime soon.  But, who knows?  History and our Nation are now at the malignant caprice of America's first dictator.",

Other world leaders have stopped laughing, they know Mr. Trump is the genuine article, he's actually their leader, too.  F.)

Yes, we'd need wise heads to do so again, and heads that would have the country and people at heart rather than political party, so the task is not an easy one.\n\nBut when I see Trump just dumping any and every regulation, restriction, cap, etc., that he can for the rather obvious reason of \"promoting\" more business and profit (and destruction, and pollution, etc.), all in order to have the \"economy\" read as if it is as good as ever, well, that's too high a price to pay for a \"nice\" economy.\n\nIn fact, that is exactly how we have come to have global warming, massive amounts of chemicals in the soil, water, and air, \"fat burgs\" floating about in the ocean, and on and on.\n\nAnd there's Trump, stripping it all away, making his rich friends and donors happy, working towards a FAKED \"good economy.\"\n\nWe need to tweak that Constitution badly, to where party politics cannot derail sanity and the sanctity of proper governance.\n\nBoth parties have failed the people here, horribly.\n\nIt is time for a new party, a new view, and some new voices...and a revamped Constitution.",

Simply disposing of Trump through impeachment is a weak solution to the deeper problem that voters are more than willing to vote for a candidate with authoritarian tendencies. Suppose that Trump was impeached. It isn't clear (at least to me, but I could be wrong) there isn't anything stopping him for running for President in 2020 and possibly winning.

However, four more years of him (not that I wish it on any living being) would more than likely see his \"presidency\" (and our country) crushed by the massive debt, gross inequality, short-sighted economic policies and incompetent foreign policies he is accumulating.",

Trump is actually building a wall and Mexico, by detaining asylum seekers in camps on their side of the border, is actually helping to pay for border security that has dramatically reduced the number of illegal border crossings! Trump has pleased the evangelicals by adding two very conservative Supreme Court justices and almost two hundred other federal judges. Trump has renegotiated NAFTA, reinstalled trade sanctions on Iran, nearly eradicated ISSIS from Iraq and then there\u2019s the economy\u2014 lowest unemployment in 50 years, booming stock market (and IRAs), and blue collar wage growth of over 7%.  \n\nDemocrats, in an alternative reality, have focus unrelentingly on investigating Trump seeking to find a high crime or misdemeanor for which to impeach him.  Despite the constant claims by Democrats that Trump is a criminal they have as yet not been able to prove a single crime. Furthermore, Democrats and progression in particular have pushed a social agenda that has given hooded thugs (Antifa) impunity to suppressing free speech and enforce political  correctness, condemned Trump supporters of being deplorable fascists and racist, and they now want to elect a socialist and become the America\u2019s newest socialist party! Rob from the rich and give to the middle class! Free everything! \n\nWake up Democrats and look at what you\u2019re becoming!",

Its inner lack of logic?\n\nSo it was okay when the Democrats pushed an impeachment inquiry to bring down an elected Oresident solely on a partisan basis, but when the Republicans responded in kind, with a partisan vote, the world's greatest bpdy had been hollowed and diminished?  Then, it  can be said the same of the House of Representatives if you want to have a shred of credibility. \n\nThe double standards you cloak yourself with are unworthy of the objective, critical mind of a real journalist. \n\nThis kind of overreach got Trump elected and will get him elected again in 2020.\n\nAnd your question about the pivot was indeed naive. You fail to read the country's need for change, on multiple levels, and to take it seriously. You cling to the past because this is where your status quo comfortably lies.",

They have been lied to and insulted for 50+ years into giving away the ideals of the greatest county on earth.  No more.  Why does the rest of the world strive to be America?  It makes no sense to destroy what we have that everyone else wants.  President Trump recognized this, he was fed up also....and he talked to America, and he told the truth of what was really happening.  And those that heard became the movement of the true American soul will not be sidetracked by the lies of the Democrats and media.  I still have seen no apologies for the two year Russian hoax, the Kavanaugh hearings, or now, this impotent impeachment gambit.

A pathological liar, Trump immediately began a campaign of lies about what the Ukraine business was all about, detailed here <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/24/donald-trump-ukraine-military-aid-1509070\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/24/donald-trump-ukraine-military-aid-1509070</a> among other places.

This is one thing a trial does. \n\nFor decades during the cold war and the wars against fascism, we wanted to believe that lies and propaganda were what the other side did.  \n\nWith the Senate vote, lies officially define our government.",

Democrats must stay true, humble, committed, caring, patriotic, focused. It's okay; this fraud of a man will crumble. Even so, there is so much to do in inequality, poverty, climate, housing, health care, etc. So much to do. Keep focused. This disease will eat itself.",

This impeachment charade has been cooked up in the same vein: a desperate attempt to smear a candidate for reelection, based on the mischaracterization of Trump's motives in asking that a foreign government investigate a sitting government official's blatant corruption. Evidently, Hunter Biden didn't get paid millions on the board of Burisma for his expertise in gas or in Ukraine, of which he had none, but because he was the son of the then-vice-president of the U.S. , and the top prosecutor investigating Burisma (and H.B.'s no-show job there) at the time wasn't fired for incompetence or overreach, but because he risked disturbing the quid-pro-quo at play between the Bidens and the corrupt Ukrainian regime.\n\nThere's nothing earnest in the Mueller report, failing to investigate Clinton's email \"slip-ups\", the ridiculous accusations against Kavanaugh, or this impeachment circus.",

He can't help himself the man is absolutely pathological and he will only feel more emboldened like he did after Mueller testified and Congress failed to file obstruction of justice charges which was a mistake in my opinion. None-the-less, Barr has been implicated, Pence has been implicated, Cipollone lied while defending Trump (he was a material witness to Trump's extortion of Ukraine according to Bolton). The press won't drop the real narrative, not as more evidence emerges. And I don't think Pelosi and the House are going to ignore more evidence of misconduct.

That too was an utter failure after it was revealed that Trump withheld funds for Ukraine.  \nPelosi and Schumer both understood that if impeachment was pursued and lost it would only serve to further empower Trump and embolden him.

It is not only a loss of face but it is loss of power and confidence in a party that has also been taken over by radical left wing dreamers and extremists.  This loss has so greatly damaged Democratic contenders that it is highly probable, that Donald Trump, no matter what his transgressions and corruptness, will win in November.  \nThe loss has undermined the Senate and the House and further divided our nation.

Mitch knows all of Don\u2019s dirty little secrets, he knows where the bodies are buried and, as a result, Don is subservient to Mitch. How often do they appear together? How often do they quote each other? Never! This is a distinct power structure that places McConnell above Trump, the politician in charge and the pigeon in its place. Trump is not, never will be, a politician and that\u2019s useful to the party. He is the ringmaster of his own spectacle, entertaining the masses while politics are done elsewhere.  \n\nThe impeachment trial may have failed to remove Trump, that was a pipe dream anyway, but it has revealed that Trump\u2019s shelf life is waning. McConnell has been forced into coercing senators to comply with only two defectors who find themselves on the right side of history if on the wrong side of Mitch. He faces an uncertain reelection struggle in Kentucky himself. The horizon is gloomier than Reps admit.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are in ghastly disarray: no one owns their party nor the party owning any candidate.

Rather than display moral courage, the Republican Senators resorted to the McConnell playbook of casting blame upon the House Democrats for rushing the impeachment proceedings, arguing deprivation of procedural due process and denial of right of counsel to justify acquittal. Add to these lame excuses the shrill expressions of Rubio, Alexander, and Portman, that removal would materially exacerbate an increasingly polarized America, potentially generating civil unrest. Rather than adhere to their constitutional duty, the Republican Senate simply concluded that the House proved its case but at the end of the day, removal would not occur, because the voters should decide this November. Beyond the artful charade is the hard cold reality of imagery.

So what?\n\nIt would have kept Trump's misdeeds on the front page above the fold as more and more information would have come out about how corrupt he truly is.  \n\nInstead, the headlines are \"Trump Acquitted as No Witnesses Are Called.\"  He is now emboldened with nothing to stop him.\n\nAnd the irony is that more and more info will STILL be dribbling out before the election.

She is one of those who saw almost all her personal net worth wiped out during the financial crash in 2008.  She voted for Obama.  President Obama promptly went on to bail out the big banks, and let almost all the culprits (and almost certainly all the biggest culprits) go free.  He, under pressure from others in his party, and the Republicans, never did anything to support the people impoverished by the shenanigans of Wall Street.  During Mr. Obama's second term it was more austerity.  She eventually recovered.  In 2016, she voted for Donald Trump.  Mrs. Clinton didn't make clear how a Clinton administration would differ from a continuation of the Obama administration.  I think she voted for \"anything else\". \n\nThe world got Trump.",

So much fear, it\u2019s erupted as a weapon to brandish, to manipulate and empower, to bully.  How did we get here?  A bunch of old white men running the government, and an old white man running a shadow government in the Senate by pandering to Trump\u2019s ego.  Trump is not smart enough to figure this stuff out and plot a strategy; he is the bully puppet behind the Citizens vs. United money that flows through the Republican party and accomplishes its goals, complicit with Fox News, the third rail of this presidency.

Yet, more confounding is only two of the Senate Republicans had the integrity to vote to hear Bolton.

My take is history will judge the left harshly, with their hysterical hyperbole over any Trump action or statement.  I have never seen a president treated so unfairly and you continue that treatment with this very weak essay. The impeachment was unjustified, and you know it.  Trump was well within his power to question whether a new Ukrainian president had a plan to fight corruption, it just so happens that Hunter Biden and Burisma are at the center of that corruption.  As Dershowitz stated, the motive made be mixed but it was justified and fell well short of an impeachable offense. Think about Benghazi for a millisecond, a lie was told that a attack on the embassy was the result of a video.  That lie, told by Clinton, Rice and Obama was done to cover up the failure of the Obama foreign policy just prior to the election.  4 people died.  No outrage on the left, but delay military aid to Ukraine for a few weeks, and out you go.  The House conducted a shoddy impeachment investigation, and could have called Bolton, but the drew it out to play a fake drama in the senate on weak impeachment charges.  If the press was not so in the tank for the Dems, acquittal would have come the first day.  The Republican Party has saved us from impeachment becoming an everyday occurrence when one party controls that house and does not like the president.  That is what history will show, and the witch hunts will be exposed.",

N.B.C. kicked off his governor of California race on the Tonight show with Jay Leno. I saw it. At another point after, there was public discussion of Arnold running for President, but then there was the realization that he was foreign born.\nLater, N.B.C.'s Don Trump started the \"Birther\" movement claiming Obama was foreign born. I see an agenda, especially that at one point General Electric owned N.B.C. and G.E. also makes power plant equipment, you know; for coal fired power plants. Then of course there was the General Election in 2016 that Trump won with the help of a Billion dollars worth of free airtime during his campaign.\nLet's also remember the Trump campaign link to the Senate in the person of Senator Sessions who was later appointed Attorney General. As a Southerner, he likely had little knowledge of how the NY region works. But Giuliani, Christie, and Comey do. Their actions helped Trump win. They are all former federal prosecutors. So was Sessions.\nSo what about the other part of the \"Duo\"; McConnell? I wonder if he and Senator Sessions shared Trump campaign knowledge? So there it is to think about. I'm confused by their secrecy, because I'm not the secretive type except that I keep my life close, and protect my family. We were threatened by the Mob in 1983.

The House impeachment was from the outset nothing more than the most extreme form of Democrat partisanship imaginable. That has apparently failed, so Ms. Dowd and the rest of the Times now set out to smear anyone who may have stood in the way of a Democratic partisan victory. The smear in this column goes not only to the president but the Republican senators who were not about to acquiesce in the Democrats' latest partisan ploy. \n\nI applaud the Republican senators who stood up to an impeachment narrative which re-iterated the totally debunked accusation that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to steal the 2016 election (does the name Robert Mueller ring a bell); and went on with the slander that Trump had to be impeached and removed from office now because he was going to similarly steal the 2020 election.\n\nThere is the concept of \"the loyal opposition.\" Oppose policy but keep that opposition within legitimate bounds. From Day One the Democrats, steadfastly backed by the mainstream media, have pursued one goal, to \"get rid of Donald Trump,\" as they put it, and in service of that have unleashed one spurious partisan attempt after another, with this impeachment only the latest.  \n\nMs. Dowd has her Donald Trump chamber of horrors. That, as the rest of the column, is nothing more than resentment that the impeachment \"get rid of Trump\" gambit did not succeed.",

He may very well do so with foreign interference which has now been sanctioned by the GOP cowards in the Senate. And if you think the past three years have been bad, just wait. Trump will take his revenge, and courts packed with Federalist Society know nothings will gladly uphold his every whim and act of cruelty.\n\nThere is only one way forward and that is to begin the process of dissolving the United States and letting those regions that wish to go their separate ways do so peacefully. What that would look like, I do not know. But the union is such in name only. A divorce is necessary and inevitable. It can be negotiated here and now, or it can come less peacefully in the near future. But come it will.",

I\u2019m not confident there will even be an election in November. Because if Trump decides otherwise, who would stop him? How would he be stopped?",

Rather, we're now engaged in a classic, even biblical war of good versus evil. Donald Trump is nothing less than the personification of the latter, and his attempts to conceal the most wretched of his activities from even those who continue to support him is concrete proof that he's aware of how morally bankrupt those activities happen to be. Then, too, the members of congress who sanction his schemes (once they finally learn about them from whistleblowers and the like) deserve no less scorn than he does.  And the folks at his Nuremberg-style rallies who go on singing his praises even while confronted with misdeeds that they'd accept from no living Democrat (nor even from any dead Republican) are the enablers of this evil.  In the end, Trump hates all the people they do (citizens of color, immigrants, Muslims, non-Zionist Jews, gays, working women, etc.) and, for them, hatred is enough.  And it's clearly not over yet: Trump will do more and worse and, regardless of the excuses and cover-ups, it's all going to come out in the end. Let good men and women pray that November IS the end.

The basic premise of the prosecution is Trump delayed and or leveraged foreign aid to push for investigation of corruption that may/probably (?) involved a potential political opponent. The apparent crime/wrong doing of this is the government aid. It seems to me the isolated case rests on weak ground. The reality is the case is never isolated with Trump its usually wrapped in \"Godzilla\" etc. And the problem with electorate beyond the Godzilla viewers is they've seen collaboration with foreign entities, falsified warrants, and other dirty tricks. It probably would have been helpful to clarify law and governance on this event, however I suspect the overreach in wanting to get Godzilla made that impossible.",

Maybe Maureen is right after all.  Because if Trump cheats and breaks the law constantly to get his ends, getting rid of pollution controls, setting up concentration camps to punish refugees fleeing deadly conditions in Mexico, Brazil and the Northern Triangle, building \"the Wall\" with funds illegally misappropriated, and working to rig the 2020 election, and the Senate simply will NOT stop him, and legislation means NOTHING, then he is the most powerful.

Half the country wanted him removed, and half the country did not. It is why the framers put a 67 vote threshold  (2/3) for removal. As Miss Pelosi said and Schumer Nadler and many other Democrats, impeachment needed to be bi partisan and overwhelming. Speaking of overwhelming, the Democrat manager said their case was overwhelming and Mr. Nadler said it was beyond a shadow of a doubt. None of that was true. So with this overwhelming slam dunk case cited by Mr. Schiff over and over again, the Democrats then wanted more witnesses.   I do not believe any of this has helped a democrat chances to defeat the president in November.",

This second time, the House should stand firm and demand witnesses, no matter how long it takes--preferably into the fall elections.",

            "comment_body": "The huge factor that all the talking heads ignored when they optimistically wrote about trump's inevitable \"pivot\" after he took office -- he would have to act more presidential soon, right? -- is that that the rules that govern political behavior in this country are largely unwritten. Presidents are governed by norms, not black and white rules engraved in stone (or at least written on parchment). And whether we like it or not, these norms are effective only if there is consensus among the players as to how the norms will be observed.\n\nWhen trump was elected, instead of an individual with a sense of history, of tradition, of pride and respect for these norms, we got an ignoramus. It was foolish to expect that he would \"pivot\" since he was totally unaware of any need to do so. His boorishness and bullying had gotten him elected president, so he saw absolutely no need to change his methods. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\nMs. Dowd concludes that trump has forced the world to pivot to him. I don't quite see it that way. What has allowed trump to leave such chaos and destruction in his wake is the sheer inability of the rest of the world to believe that a U.S. president could behave like trump. Surely, somebody would somehow stop him, right?\n\nThis incredulity gave trump a head start that he has used to his advantage. But reality has caught up with trump, and his words and actions are increasingly being called out for what they are: the actions of an out of control brat.",

There were 214 cases of gun injuries alone in 2019, almost half in LAPD's South Bureau.   Anyone want to bet that stop and frisk would save a lot of these injuries and deaths?   Better to let the murder and mayhem continue than to upset the vested interest of a few corrupt Democratic \"civic leaders\", I guess.\n\nMy party, the Democratic Party, talks utter gibberish on all of these issues and, I and a whole lot of voters know it.  Trump gives voice to real grievances, yes these are real honest to God grievances, that Democrats simply ignore or pretend don't exist.  My party, the Democratic Party, never seems to miss an opportunity to lose because they live in chic Beverly Hills parties and ignore the harsh reality of the real world below.",

But we have always been a hopeful nation, looking for the best in others, and thinking that when it comes to being a president goodness will be revealed.  But that was not to be.\n\nI have been depressed these last few weeks, and particularly these past few days.  What we have witnessed is the metastasis of this cancer in the Oval Office.  Trump is the magnet that pulls all those in his orbit to become like him with their dark sides being victorious.  Little by little we have seen his Cabinet, e.g., Pompeo and Barr, and his Republican Senate sell their souls because of the fear of losing their own power over us.  The MAGA family is as heartless and rabid as ever.  I can go on.  But I leave you all with this plea: We are better than all of the above.

This rational was made to look ridiculous by her later waiting almost a month before handing over the impeachment to the Senate.

Prof Hill during his testimony to the House called the current impeachment of Trump, \"the shortest, thinnest and narrowest impeachment in US history.\"  \n\nFrom a strategic view, the House Democrats knew that in the Clinton impeachment the Democrats had voted in block for no new witnesses and acquittal.  They should have known the GOP would likely follow the same path for  Trump.  In the House, they had the numbers and the courts on their side, but not the patience required to get the testimony.

The entire Republican Party has been shown to be entirely devoid of any principles except those of self-preservation and self-enrichment. If Americans don't see what has been laid bare before them and reject it at the polls in November, well then, they really are not competent to have a government of the people and for the people.",

N.B.C. kicked off his governor of California race on the Tonight show with Jay Leno. I saw it. At another point after, there was public discussion of Arnold running for President, but then there was the realization that he was foreign born.\nLater, N.B.C.'s Don Trump started the \"Birther\" movement claiming Obama was foreign born. I see an agenda, especially that at one point General Electric owned N.B.C. and G.E. also makes power plant equipment, you know; for coal fired power plants. Then of course there was the General Election in 2016 that Trump won with the help of a Billion dollars worth of free airtime during his campaign.\nLet's also remember the Trump campaign link to the Senate in the person of Senator Sessions who was later appointed Attorney General. As a Southerner, he likely had little knowledge of how the NY region works. But Giuliani, Christie, and Comey do. Their actions helped Trump win. They are all former federal prosecutors. So was Sessions.\nSo what about the other part of the \"Duo\"; McConnell? I wonder if he and Senator Sessions shared Trump campaign knowledge? So there it is to think about. I'm confused by their secrecy, because I'm not the secretive type except that I keep my life close, and protect my family. We were threatened by the Mob in 1983. So, what are we going to do to serve justice if that is the underlying goal? I'm no spy.",

I was surprised that only Mitt Romney and Senator Collins seemed to recognize the significance of the long-term stain on the party by voting for a fair trial.\n\nI have respect for Senator Alexander but fail to see that voting for more witnesses and documents so as to use the high public attention, this impeachment trial has attracted, to educate the voters on Trumpism. For example, the public and most Senators have not seen the grand jury data from the Manafort or Stone trials. In fact the public has not seen the verbatim transcript of the Ukraine calls. \n\nThere is no downside to a fair trial.\n\nI also believe the \"cultural fires burning out there\" will only be more widespread by election time so I suspect a potentially uncontrollable inferno in November.",

Allowing a president to ignore all subpoenas under a made-up concept of \"absolute immunity\", coupled with the courts taking forever to decide on presidential appeals to Congressional subpoenas, may not result in a future Democratic president taking advantage of this supposed new power, but it will help future Republican presidents do it as part of a strategy to undo things that prior Democratic presidents and Congresses have accomplished.\n\nAs demographics change and the GOP's resources gradually dwindle, they see an imperial presidency as one of their main strategies for retaining enough power to impose much of their will on the country against that of the majority of voters, even if only every other presidential administration.",

McConnell on the other hand has been toiling for the GOP for years and is an invaluable part of an initiative started before Reagan was cast as President, a confederation of right-wing conservatives whose strategic plan to dismantle democratic institutions that impede \"free market\" pursuits through deregulation, transfer of wealth, etc. Obstructing Obama, theft of a Supreme Court and now acquittal of Trump without hearing evidence are jewels in his chamber pot. Like Trump, McConnell is probably fueled by some complex personal rage but he sublimates it for the Cause greater than himself and is rewarded with power and prestige.

We can\u2019t afford to lose a single vote this time as we did last time with Bernie vs. Hilary vs. third parties.\n\nIt anyone doubts the necessity of this unity, just consider that in November we will be at the tipping point between democracy and dictatorship, incredible as that might seem. Even Democratic control of the House and Senate in 2021 won\u2019t be enough to stop Trump from trashing what\u2019s left of the U.S. Constitution. Stalin asked \u201cHow many divisions has the Pope?\u201d The answer is, about the same number as the U.S. Congress and the courts have.\n\nFaster than most of us can imagine.  things will become sufficiently ugly that the average citizen won\u2019t have the luxury of pretending that \u201cIt can\u2019t happen here.\u201d They\u2019ll know from personal experience that the opposite is true. If you doubt this, I give you Exhibit A, the character, personality and history of one Donald Trump and his minions.\n\nSo let\u2019s be clear about what\u2019s ahead: a vote for or against democracy. And nobody gets to sit this one out. If democracy loses, every one of us will pay.",

Law enforcement began a search and put notices identifying these dangerous men. The man of the house remains oblivious to what is happening in his home, his wife and maid notice, but he insists hospitality is more important than the few missing items. The two guests steal and pawn household items to buy supplies for a big fire. The play asks the question, can we recognize evil when it is right in front of us!",

That is not Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. Most voters - in the swing States particularly -find them to be  too far left and scary. You can argue this point, but polls and common Sense support my point. Joe Biden or Mike Bloomberg have the best chance of winning the election,but of course neither of them are ideal. The second most important strategic point is to concede that most Americans, like most Europeans, want border enforcement and tightly controlled migration. The rise of far-right parties in Europe and Donald Trump in America are directly related to the fear of unrestricted migration and disruption of cultural and Civic norms. It is not  immoral to respect those fears, and it is foolish to ignore them.

In 1924 at the Soviet Union Party Congress the Last Will and Testament of Lenin was read. It accused Stalin of betraying the Revolution and of losing the war with Poland by disobeying orders (instead launching a failed attempt to himself conquer Austria and Hungary), both charges manifestly true, and of being a pervert, which I am ignorant of the accuracy of. A vote was taken to expel him from the party and from all offices. A solid majority voted to do so, showing far more backbone than 51 Republican Senators. But as Stalin would explain years later, \"Who votes? Not important. Who COUNTS votes? VERY important.\" Stalin had called for a secret ballot, allegedly so that each person could vote his conscience without fear of reprisal. His henchmen counted the supposedly secret ballots, and since they had also carefully collected the ballots they knew who would soon become \"unpersons\". \nAs the title says, from now on Trump is \"unrepentant and untrammeled\".  He will get worse. Republican Senators should note that even those who had supported Stalin were liable to be liquidated in later purges.",

This occurred gradually as power shifted away from a representative democracy to a centralized imperial authority with the emperor holding all the power.  Similar to President Trump, Julius Caesar began gaining significant power due to internal divisions within the republic including competing factions either loyal to the plebeian or patrician classes or allegiance to specific military commanders. \n\nSimilar to Professor Dershowitz's \"l'\u00e9tat, c'est moi\" argument during the Senate trial to defend Trump's actions in Ukraine, Julius Caesar also used the internal strife within Rome to consolidate his power. As emperor, Caesar  commanded the loyalty of the soldiers in his army and enriched himself greatly after the military conquered Gaul. The parallels are striking between Caesar's mindset & that of President Trump.\n\nUnder Augustus\u2019s reign, emperors gained the ability to introduce & veto laws as well as controlling who could hold office which allowed the emperor to further consolidate power.  As a result, the assembly lost its power to represent the people & became virtually ceremonial. The Senate survived merely for the appearance of legitimizing the rule of the emperor. Just like Trump's GOP senate, its function is purely ceremonial & comprised of the wealthy & elite who claim to represent the people. Trump may follow in Caesar's footsteps & assume power for life.",

For example, by forming a coalition -  selecting a critical role for each candidate based on experience and talent. If the majority of the candidates participated and fully campaigned in support of the chosen Presidential/Vice-Presidential candidates as proposed members of a new executive branch, it would demonstrate to this country - and the world - what they are willing to do for the future of democracy; something this extreme is likely the level of change/disruption required to win this election. \n\nWhy not? Obviously, the candidates believe that they individually can win - but the risk is too high. Each candidate has political obligations - but each must make it clear to supporters that while there are many issues that she/he supports on their behalf, preventing the collapse of our democracy is of first importance. Yes, it's a career sacrifice for all but one of them, but others have sacrificed far more for our country - four years service in an un-sought role is little in comparison. There must be logistic impediments - but how can there be any rule that can't be challenged, given this state of affairs?\n\nAmidst all of the anti-democratic processes and influences from both internal and external players, the risk grows that no single Democratic candidate is going to be able to win this election.

When Hawaii was invaded in 1941, we could have continued to bury our heads until England was a pile of dust and the globe was bisected by Japan and Germany.\n\nWe had leaders who had a clear vision and the opportunity to turn us towards higher purpose, selflessly, and to the prosperity of the world. \n\nWe survived McCarthyism, the Viet Nam era, Women's Suffrage, the Civil War and any number of other \"national crises\". If the people in the places who can elect a president choose DT, then that is who we will have. There is no crisis, because a sufficient part of the country is completely and democratically satisfied, regardless of the other's think. Are we in danger of recreating the turmoil of the Civil War and the Viet Nam/ Civil Rights era? Of course.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the Democratic Party is completely paralyzed by dithering. Liberal ideals are complicated and the American People have lost patience. I recommend those who can, save their money, those who have little learn to live on less. We are well into a period where the truth is what we are told it is, allies are who we are told they are. Just relax and enjoy the ride.",

Racism is the source of every problem.  2.  Just wait and the economy will grow itself out of every problem.\n\nNeedless to say, Joe Sixpack doesn't know which of these lies to believe.\n\nUnfortunately I'm convinced that global warming is real and will bring economic growth to an end in the not too distant future.  I'm an outcast from both the in-groups, and have no place to call home.\n\nFrom my vantage point, Trump is terrible but it would be marginally better to remove him via election instead of impeachment.  Impeachment would have set a dangerous precedent.  Trump's Democratic successor would have faced impeachment starting on day one.  We would have kissed bipartisanship a permanent goodbye.\n\nThe only problem is that the Democrats are doing a terrible job of selecting Trump's replacement.\n\nAll the Democratic candidates promised to extend health care to illegal immigrants in the first debate.\n\nUniversal health care will be hard enough without Democrats working to open the borders.\n\nNeither party notices that we need to control population growth.",

The Republicans started down this slide to autocratic rule when they adopted the southern strategy. That proved to be not to enough so the brought in the religious right. That gave them a large base of voters who didn't care too much for where liberal democracy has taken this country. This illiberal base was then joined in a coalition with the economic libertarian Koch brothers and single issues voters on abortion and gun control and also anti-government militia types. Thanks to Newt Gingrich the Republicans put party over country. All these voters formed a firm base of the Republican Party but were angry at the Republican establishment which never delivered. Enter Donald Trump as a racist without dog whistles with a black president in office and the enthusiasm for changing the whole system broke out. Finally the white supremacists had a candidate they could trust and they will support him no matter what he does. It is now out in the open that in the US there is no common ground between left and right. The belief in common ground has been lost and there is nothing left but an all out battle with one side putting party over country and the other side putting country over party.",

We who detest Trump have only two options at this point. Live under this dictator and hope he is overthrown, or leave (if we have the means). There are a number of thriving democracies that provide many educational and professional opportunities for their citizens. Time for those of us who can, to begin looking at these. \n\nI say all this not as some hysterical teenager. I'm in my mid-60's. I lived through the Civil Rights era, Women's rights, and the Viet Nam war. I've been an attorney for some 40 years now. I was born in this country, and I am a person of color. \n\nAnd I have no doubt in my mind that Trump will not be removed by any peaceful means. At some point he will have his children take is place. And he will leave only at a time of his choosing.",

He operates under the idea that the way to win is to appeal to this mythical, corporate-media-created centrist voter that supposedly will decide every presidential race. I resent that Bruni's article implies that because Pete is the first truly viable gay presidential candidate, we should all run to embrace his candidacy--even when it goes against our best interests.  I'm sorry, but identity politics doesn't cut it.  Polls tell us health care is Americans' number one concern.  Pete's Medicare \"For those who want it\", is a pandering, wishy-washy way of trying to have it both ways: appease progressives that want to hear about nationalized health care, while not scaring off moderates who don't want to lose their pristine, employer-provided health care plans.  The problem is everyone is one pink slip away from losing their cherished health care, and it shouldn't be that way. So on the issue that matters most, this Harvard-educated Rhodes Scholar doesn't earn a passing grade.",

I also believe that his astounding ride into to the top tier of candidates is attributed partially to his strengths. I also believe it's also partially the result of privilege he inherits, and the \"safe for straight people\" persona he exhibits.  \n\nI'm more persuaded by the experience, savvy and bravery demonstrated by candidates who have been working on these problems for decades.  They've gotten their hands dirty, made compromises, taken hits, and weathered through the storm.  \n\nIf Pete gets the nomination, will I vote for him? Absolutely.  But I've been supporting candidates who have been in the trenches fighting for people (Harris, Warren, Kobluchar) for a while. This longevity and consistency matters to me.",

Not because she's a star that he should have \"twinkled\" to as a gay man, but because he strikes me as clueless to the way she uses her stardom for her body politics as a voluptuous, oversized black woman who exudes sensuality and beauty. Makes me wonder if Buttigieg has ever witnessed a gay parade, so often led by \"Dykes on Bikes\" and where different gay groups and demographics assert their identity by emphasizing their physical differences, putting them on display as an affirmation of being and the right to be. That's the part that saddens me about Buttigieg, not his privileged upbringing (which I have no issues with), but the fact that his privileged upbringing seems to have denied him an authentic connection with our diversity as a nation.",

The right has tried to present the left as godless and believing in nothing, and they\u2019ve stolen the concept of true piety (while often possessing nothing of the kind) from believers on the left. As if their way of applying faith and believing in God was the only way to do it. \n\nIf we had another \u201ctemple\u201d and Jesus existed, these people would be thrown out of it. They worship Mammon more than God. \n\nHe\u2019s profoundly changed the discourse in this way, and I hope he\u2019s not the last progressive candidate to do this.

We exalt presidential spouses as if they were kings or queens, but this is a holdover from the British monarchy. Spouses of monarchs are important because they sire or give birth to future monarchs, but George H. Bush is the only president who has ever sired a future president. (President John Adams sired the father of a future president.) So why do we need the Office of the First Lady, which should be renamed \u201cOffice of the First Spouse.\u201d \n\nIf we continue to treat presidential spouses as part of government, Americans should vote only for presidential candidates whose spouses hold views that contradict their own. For example, James Carville, who managed Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign, was married to Mary Matilin, who worked for George H. Bush. If either had become president, the constitutional system of checks and balances would have been extended to the presidential; bedroom.

He\u2019s smart, empathic, ambitious, likable, and focused.  Gay is pretty much a non-issue.  Whether he wins the nomination this time around or not, we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of him in future.  \n\nSomebody had to be the first gay Presidential candidate.  I\u2019m so glad it was Pete.",

Less than 50 percent of African American and Hispanics support gay marriage. Democrats are more reliant than are Republicans on African American and Hispanic voters.  So Buttigieg's sexual orientation may reduce turnout among African American or Hispanic voters.\n\nIf Buttigieg wins the nomination, he might win the popular vote, but there is no contest for the popular vote. The contest is for the electoral vote.The Republican candidate would take the homophobic vote even if he or she espouses support for gay rights and gay marriage \n\n<a href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage</a>/",

That in itself would be a huge change compared to a man who won't even read a bullet-point daily briefing.  I'd like to see Buttigieg stand up at the next debate--and on every rally stage--and say in so many words, \"one of my first priorities will be to appoint and listen to advisors with expertise in all areas.  I will never pretend that I know 'more than all the generals.'\"\n\nTo me, that's one the things most in his favor: he knows what he doesn't know, and that's what we need.",

The country needs to heal.\n\nIf attracting moderate Republicans is key to winning this election, then Pete is a solid choice. He doesn\u2019t have the Biden baggage. Moderate Republicans in wealthier suburbs are less likely to be concerned about his sexuality. But if support in rural areas is key to winning this race then Pete won\u2019t do well - and that is assuming that the base of the party backs whoever the nominee is because they aren\u2019t Trump.\n\nUltimately, I think most voters respond to the candidate they like the best because of their personality and not their politics. Democratic primary voters are different in this fundamental way from the general electorate. \n\nIf we really want to beat Trump we need to stop looking as much at policy as we do personality. It is here, more than lack of support in the black community or being gay, that works against Pete. He is smart and he is eager to put his brain to work solving big problems, but he is more bland than I like to admit. I think most people will look at him and think he is boring.",

He also understood that the subterranean racism always simmering beneath the surface during his administration  would once again rear its ugly head through the rise of Trumpism. \n\nPresident Obama is also quoted as saying: \u201cSometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early.\u201d It would be wise for Pete Buttigieg to acknowledge the same in an America that is not ready to accept a homosexual man even one with his stellar qualifications. It might just take a more liberal and socially conscious future generation to do so.",

And the mortality seems to be higher for older folks.  We may need to keep that in mind.\n\nYou asked, rhetorically speaking I think, what does Buttigieg\u2019s gayness tell you?  I\u2019d pose it differently:  What does his marriage tell me?  I say that because he\u2019s chosen to make his gayness public - by the very fact of his marriage to a man.  (I actually wrote a blog a few years back about marriage, which included what I think is the key to marriage.  And that is \u201cconversation\u201d - \u201ca lifetime of conversation\u201d I called it.  And that lifelong conversation can be had no matter the sex of the person you\u2019ve chosen to spend your life with.  (I say this as a 75 year old white person:  blue eyes; white hair; old.)\n\nAnd when I think of Buttigieg, I\u2019m happy he\u2019s found his life partner, his lifetime of conversation partner.  That makes his life richer.  It would make him a better president, having that support and that someone who knows you through and through.  And can tell you \u201cthe truth\u201d - sometimes, \u201cthe painful truth.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m not gonna post a link to that blog.  I hardly post there any more.

But when pressed, many Black spokespersons admit that the good Mayor's homosexuality is in the African American community a \"factor.\"\n\nRemember Tom Bradley. The \"Bradley Effect\" though regrettable needs to be recalled. In 1982, Bradley, then Mayor of Los Angeles, led in all the polls in the race for California Governor, only to succumb to defeat on election day. His race was identified as being the determining factor. Being an African American was at that time too large an obstacle to overcome. People simply lied when asked if they were going to vote for him. \n\nSo Frank Bruni, your optimism may be premature. Is America ready for a gay President?",

What is a truer test is how he is regarded by black LGBTQ voters, clearly not homophobic, but who see him as mypopic, distant, and at times -- inept and insulting.  For example, in response to a black South Bend woman who told him he'd not have her vote, he said, \"I'm not asking for your vote.\"  Stupid -- especially for someone running for office.  And we know full-well that he ain't stupid. Then what is it, I ask, gay black man that I am.",

He was first elected \nwhile in the closet, then served in Iraq and revealed he was gay shortly before his second election.

Somebody's sexual preference tells us little about whether than person is a good or bad person, a good or bad doctor or engineer or artist, or a good or bad president. \n\nIt is not as important that there will or will not be a gay president as it is that the stereotypes that have defined and limited gay people in straight peoples' minds are clearly fading. The first gay president will probably wear pressed white shirts, because that's the sort of clothes that most presidential candidates wear.  He'll be different from most gay men, because people capable of being president stand out from their peers, and the fact that he's a gay man will be the least interesting thing about him.\n\n\"I am large.

I think this country has had enough elected officials from elitist institutions, none of whom have truly helped improve the lives of everyday Americans. An education from the Ivy League shouldn\u2019t be deemed as a virtue, but rather a warning to the electorate.\n\nMayor Pete\u2019s insistence that he is a man of faith is personally disagreeable to me. I grew up with a strict Christian upbringing and I find the teachings and traditions of most organized religions tend to center on cruelty and violence. I understand the role religion plays in our politics, but it is 2019, and the last three years have exposed the hypocrisy of the religious right, which continues to support the current occupant of the White House. \n\nMayor Pete\u2019s attempts to connect with voters lack authenticity. The fact that he calls himself Mayor Pete is a bit too cutesy for my taste and leaves me feeling that Mayor Pete is a product of focus group market research.\n\nLastly, as a gay man of color, I have met gay white men like Mayor Pete. Gay white men enjoy a certain privilege in the gay community, which frankly needs to stop.

And since few fundamentalists run in Democratic Party circles, the folks Pete's trying to impress in the primaries have long ago accepted gays. It is instructive that his support lags among younger voters -- the least homophobic cohort. It tells you how ho-hum gayness has become.\n\nAnother factor is that, though gays may be reluctant to admit it, their embrace of marriage is at bottom a conservative accommodation. It is a tacit rejection of bath house promiscuity and wild claims for radical sexual freedom. Watching TV late at night with your spouse and your dog -- it doesn't get more boringly conventional than that. Except in the fundamentalist camp, gay marriage has been a bridge to acceptance.\n\nFinally, gayness is economically neutral. A gay person is no less likely to be free market capitalist or venture entrepreneur than anyone else. Corporate America has evolved to the point that it mainly cares about your economic ideas and the political values emanating from them. If you support the corporate vision on offer and are willing to work to manifest it, corporations will increasingly accommodate the identity issues -- race, sex, gender.",

Buttigieg is not only brilliant, thoughtful, decent, visionary, and patriotic but a candidate of genuine integrity and honor? His views are subtle, thoughtful, and respectful of the intelligence of the American public. He is rational and clear-headed and refuses to make fantastical promises, pledging instant nostrums; he is a consensus- builder rather than a divisive pandering ideologue . Mayor Pete is the perfect antidote to the current bigotry, intolerance, divisiveness and hatred undermining our nation. Finally, unlike the draft-dodger in the White House, he is a person of courage and principle who risked his life and limb serving the nation in an active battle zone.\n\n\nHis extraordinary command of the issues is second to none and his use of the English language is masterful. What other candidate can answer any impromptu question so astutely and in perfectly quotable sentences without raising your blood pressure? \n\n\u201cThe purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification of the American people.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd when I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word. And our allies knew it and our enemies knew it.\u201c\n\n- Pete Buttigieg",

I don't believe I am an anomaly or that the results were flawed by database programming errors. Mayor Pete is the one candidate I have seen who is pragmatic, thoughtful, respectful, gracious, articulate, and willing to compromise -- many of the factors that I believe are necessary for great leadership. I think my result on the quiz reflects not just the synergy between Mayor Pete and I, but also the changing nature of US society. The younger generations are growing up in a world where sexual orientation is not something to be questioned, but accepted. They live in a world where religion is fading in importance. They don't judge companies based on the quality of their products or price, but on their corporate citizenship/values.

Michaud the governorship in my state. I voted for Mike. He served in the Maine House and Senate from 1980 to 2003, then was a 4-term Representative for the 2nd District in Maine.

The way that drugs and drunk-driving are thought of now just didn\u2019t exist during Bible time. People then engaged in homosexuality but was different than today. So if you are looking for a text that speaks to homosexuality and so-called homosexual marriage, you won\u2019t find it.\n\nYou will find a high view of marriage throughout the Bible. All of that teaching describes marriage between one man and woman for their entire lives. If homosexuality was something that God allowed as a means of glorifying himself he would have spoke up about it. But he didn\u2019t. Virtually all mentions of homosexuality in the Bible are in the context of sin. For Pete Buttigieg to suggest that someone who doesn\u2019t accept his gay lifestyle has a problem with his creator, in light of the Biblical text, is tantamount to saying that the creator has a problem with the creator as well. \n\nPeople don\u2019t like to believe this because they want to be able to embrace prevailing culture. History shows that the Bible always challenges some aspect of culture. You sometimes has to choose if you are going with the Bible, or are you going to bow your knee to prevailing culture.",

If your behaviour pattern includes being a good listener, seeking knowledge, knowing how and when to commit to a decision after taking in what information you can get, then you are likely a good candidate.  If you are willing to stand by well-informed principle rather than dogma, then you are likely a good candidate.  If, despite being the smartest person in the room, you recognise you may not necessarily be the brightest light in the room at the time, you are likely a good candidate.  \nA good candidate needs to know how to surround self with good people, and know how to trust them and allow them to do their work.

I note, too, that Biden does not appear to have done this work as well; however, Biden's age and lived experiences have given him some wisdom and 'street cred' with racially oppressed communities (I note that I am NOT a Biden supporter). \n\nFrankly, the Democrats are in a world of hurt when it comes to the vote of racially oppressed communities (including voter repression).

He's certainly smart and articulate on many issues. But his one and only experience is as mayor of a small mid-west city, and he hasn't even handled that well. Imagine putting him in charge of national affairs.\n\nAnd, yes, he did serve in the military, and I respect that enormously. But he was a ground grunt and didn't deal with global geopolitics at senior levels. His service, while noteworthy, isn't a sufficient qualification to make him Commander in Chief.\n\nAside from speaking well, what has Pete done to make him qualified to be President? Nothing. His campaign is well ahead of his time. He should run for Congress and get some credibility there before launching himself at the White House. He isn't ready for that, by a long shot.",

Initially, blacks also expressed disappointment that the President wasn't doing more, at least overtly, for the black community.  With time, both groups, still marginalized, of course, came to see that it was through President Obama's actions--and certainly with the help of his wife--that his character was molding a more accepting and inclusive country. The Obamas' record speaks for itself.  Mayor Pete may be too young for some voters, but his intellect and his personal history as an outsider--indeed, an outcast, for some--has developed an empathy in him that cannot be be purchased with inherited or real estate money.",

Frank Bruni has an epiphany in Iowa regarding a political Wunderkind who happens to be gay. Terrific. All his supporters write in to cheer. \n\nHowever, Whether Mayor Pete will be the Dem torch bearer or Warren or Sanders, etc, let\u2019s acknowledge the corrupt machinery from 2016 is still in place. And even stronger!\n\nBeware infighting, Dems! Danger ahead. Get involved! Vote your preference in primaries and caucuses, but Vote for the Nominee matter who.",

Not many individuals graduating from Harvard and then attending Oxford on a Rhodes scholar enlist in the military yet alone after being elected mayor of a large city. Mayor Pete is a man of high character and religious faith who happens to be openly gay and proud. Many Americans imagine him through a closed window as president of the country with his sexuality being a compliment to his success as an honorable man rather than a deterrent. This is a watershed moment for humanity's progress as a whole especially given the ugliness of homophobia rearing its ugly head in the age of Trump. As in the case of Jimmy Carter's win post Nixon's evil, a Buttigieg presidency would be a vote for a return to civility & respect for our individual differences which, when woven together, makes us the most exceptional country in the world.",

Many older voters like Mayor Pete because they see him as an old-fashioned moderate despite his being a married, gay man and focused on the gig economy and the environment.\n\nIt's homophobia in the Black community.  It's a religious, conservative community.  It's ironic that those who have been the object of extreme discrimination for generations would themselves discriminate.  Black voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 8 (which prohibited same-sex marriage) in California.  (BTW, Prop. 8 was later found to be unconstitutional by California's Supreme Court.)  Black people, at least those who vote, tend to be religious conservatives and they are homophobic.   \n\nThe minority communities very much need to stick together to defeat the racism and bigotry of the GOP led by Trump. It's very sad when this doesn't happen\n\nFortunately Joe Biden has appeal to both the Black and the LGBTQ Communities.

Obviously that initial support was pretty important and gave him some breathing room before he was able to connect with a broad spectrum of voters who have now become very excited about him and what he would do as president.

With health care he talks about a public option competing against the private sector, it is in a sense the old market theory; it is the same drivel that if there was competition health care would be a cheap consumer product, it doesn't work that way. Unlike consumer goods, medical care is too individualized and right now has too many stakeholders, and it leads to all kinds of problems. Health insurers make money denying care, whereas doctors make more money the more services they do (so for example own an MRI clinic). Pharm companies have incentive to push their products, so they in a sense bribe doctors to use their stuff; and worse, they have every incentive to price gouge.

There are many different kinds of people who are gay and it seems strange that he is being attacked for not toeing the party line.  I don't mean the Democratic Party line (whatever that is!) but the LBGT activists' party line.  It's hard to believe he got attacked by them.  It's a strange thing these days, being told how to think and act because of a single characteristic (sexual orientation).  It's sad to see this where there should be unity.\n\nThe fact that his main disqualification is that he's too young/inexperienced tells you how far this country has come.  Or at least the liberal part of the country.  Perhaps it's time for those activists to catch up with the mainstream. \n\nI was impressed particularly by his talking about his faith.  That was important to me.  There is a lot more to the Christian faith than the politicized Christian churches of the Right.  Pete was talking about his individual convictions, and it seemed to me the kind of faith and kindness Jimmy Carter professed as president, and still does.  It's the faith of the civil rights movement that included people of faith from many religions.  It's a step toward reclaiming the moral part of one's faith, declaring a moral compass.  And who doesn't want a politician with a moral compass these days?",

Presidents are politicians, they are not just executives, and politicians know to meet their audience where they are. You can't take some one on a ride and lift them to higher ground, if you can't first get them on the train. I have heard some folks in the gay community criticize the black electorate for not enthusiastically supporting Mayor Pete. This is unfair criticism.

And a more recent NYT article suggests he should be playing closer attention to POC issues within his own campaign.\n\nWhile his being gay is a non-issue as far as many urban and Democratic voters are concerned, it may be a significant negative among non-urban and non-Democratic voters.\n\nAn earlier NYT opinion piece on whether Pete is \"gay enough\" was too subtle for many; that he is gay at all, complete with husband, may be too much for many voters in fly-over land.\n\nIf Pete could successfully run for House/Senate/governor that would bolster his political credentials and might make him a plausible candidate in a later run for President.\n\nI am a life-long Democrat and I sincerely hope the grown-ups in the party can take charge and find an electable candidate who will appeal to the large majority of American voters, especially those who felt their needs and concerns were ignored in 2016.\n\nFailure to do so will inevitably lead to another term for Trump.",

We also face a judiciary without a conscience as well as noted in the story in today's NYT about the woman sentenced to prison for 90 day because of a $110 bill. She has cancer and must start treatment immediately at Hershey Medical Center. The judge was unmoved but now the Lt. Governor of PA is involved and we may see some action.  It's disgusting.\nRecently I made a payment to Yamaha Motor Finance and they started charging me $38 per transaction because they said it was a day late.  We subsequently found out they received it on time but held the check for up to 10 days because of an incorrect number on the account. All they had to do was call!  I'm going to pay them off and have nothing to do with them again. Oh, by the way, they told another lie. There is no such thing as Yamaha Motor Finance. There is Web Bank. They make the rules.  They had my name address and phone and my good check.  No excuse.\nAnd on top of that Synchrony Bank, who manages credit accounts for Loews refused my check for over $2400 because they claimed the account (which had the right numbers on it) didn't exist.  So they returned my payment to Wells Fargo.  No one knows what was happening but they told me, quite literally, that I am a very senile senior. Wells Fargo was nice and helped us get the money to them.  I'm real senile. I have at least five 7 digit savings and retirement accounts. People just have a bad case of no brains.",

The endowment recognizes academic excellence and leadership among the cadets, but the new award is specifically for examples of resilience, reliability, resourcefulness and most importantly, kindness. I instructed the cadre to select one cadet that has all four with an emphasis on kindness. This is not an easy task. Anybody can be nice, but kindness is a different quality that is not given the credit it deserves in society today, if ever. Certainly we hear feel good stories about kind people and gestures but it isn't a quality that is shouted from the ramparts so to speak in formal settings. The relatively easy to gauge metrics of grades and examples of leadership in group settings are well established. I wanted to acknowledge and recognize a cadet that has qualities not heretofore associated with leaders. Perhaps in my small way I can shine a light on kindness which is another way of doing the right thing at the right time.",

Ms James was wonderfully compassionate in this case. However, I am kinda siding with the bank on this one. I went through training years ago to be a crisis hotline volunteer. I never actually served as a volunteer, but I remember them drumming into us that we were never, ever to agree to meet a caller. No matter how serious the situation, no matter how trustworthy and sincere and distressed the caller sounds, you just don't know what their real motives are. It could be a setup, and the call center worker could be putting herself in danger by going to meet the caller. Perhaps her employer overreacted, but I understand why they considered it a violation of company policy. Maybe my distrust reflects badly on American culture, but I think that kind of caution is appropriate almost anywhere in the world, many places even more than here.",

My big bank in the US has a \"Bill Pay\" system that snail mails checks from my bank account to the payee's physical mailbox. It doesn't use bank to bank electronic transfer.  I can't just type in the payee's bank account details and pay them from my account. It's so last 20 years ago by Australian standards.

Ironically, the US reminded this British visitor, of another place I visited briefly in my youth - the Soviet Union. Similarly alien, and similarly tense. The irony, of course, is that the US appears to be our model as we Brits seek a de facto 51st state status post-Brexit.

U.S. Bank is a national association (N.A) which means it's a federally chartered bank rather than one that's state chartered. As a national association, the Office of Comptroller of Currency (OCC) which is part of the Treasury Dept. is its regulator, and there are regulations governing demand deposit accounts like checking accounts. Eugenio should file a complaint with the OCC if US Bank failed to perform properly in terms of deposit availability. Emily James should file a lawsuit against the bank for improper termination and if she does, I hope she wins a bundle. It's difficult to switch banks. I know, due to electronic funds transfer (EFT) transactions, branch proximity, etc.,  but its customers should give it some thought. When Wells Fargo opened unrequested customer accounts and engaged in various other shenanigans, the OCC came down on them like a ton of bricks. Lastly, if you have a savings account, note that online banks are paying in the range of 1.8% as opposed to brick and mortar banks which pay virtually 0% interest.  Online banks are FDIC insured just like conventional brick and mortar banks and it's easy to transfer money via EFT between bank accounts.",

The horrific practice of paying CEOs millions of dollars a year, while the workers are treated like dirt and paid a fraction of the CEO for what is \"real\" work sickens and disgusts me. The banks, the pharmaceutical/\"health care\" companies, credit card companies are ruled by the bottom line. Period. There is no room for humanity, compassion, reason. My particular bank runs a commercial in which it opens the door after hours to admit a man standing in the rain. Only on TV would this happen. I have been in the bank when the manager is standing by the door with the keys to lock it at 5:59 pm. Where this cycle of overcompensation of CEOs, corporate greed, and the anguish of the people who go up against them will end, I don't know. But it makes me physically ill. Will this CEO do the right thing? Maybe while the spotlight and scrutiny are on him, but once they are not on him, I suspect it will be business as usual. A sad, sad commentary on our world.",

Not Ms. James, who has nothing worth suing for, but her employer, the Bank, as, seemingly authorized by her manager, she was on Company business when she drove to meet Mr. James.\n\n4. Unless this was a one-time-only paycheck, Mr. Eugenio surely knew the bank's policy regarding when the funds in his account would become available. \n\n5. Does anyone expect the Bank's C.E.O. to be involved in every transaction of the bank? Now he is involved, but...\n\n6. If it was against Bank rules, Ms. James was wrong to have taken her action, no matter how kind it was. They make the rules; she does not.\n\n7.

Therefore, yes to rules....but more importantly, yes to empathy and problem solving! I say promote her!",

Every Thursday I would deposit my paycheck like clockwork, and they knew that. On the several occasions when it looked like a check I wrote was going to overdraw on my account, I received a call from the bank manager asking if I was planning on making my regular deposit and if I wanted them to hold the check until I had sufficient funds in my account. I always said yes and they always happily held onto it to help me avoid overdraft fees. That is customer service that is way above and beyond. Since that time I have only used mutual banks, small local banks, or credit unions for my banking (and we ended up using this bank to mortgage our house years later for this reason). They seem to have realized something the large corporations haven't: good customer service and hiring good people with a decent moral compass is just as important to the bottom line as interest rates and banking fees. I avoid all large corporate banks as much as I can for this very reason.",

I've gotten nowhere trying to get them to look into their records about my dispute. So numerous times their people suggested I go into arbitration.

It's always only worked for the elites and been an exploitative failure for the other 95% of us. And rising from poor to rich isn't just exclusive to America or Capitalism. So you can stop pretending that's the only way that ever happens. \n\nCapitalism by it's very nature is anti-egalitarian and anti-environment.

That was the only reason I moved my accounts to them.\nAt the time they charged a 4.95 a month fee which was less than most. About eight years later I became eligible for a credit union and opened an account there.\nWhen I went to close the USBank account I was cornered by a branch manager trying to get me to keep the account. As an inducement he told me about thier free on line bill pay service. I looked at him and asked how long had that service been free as I was still being charged the fee. The answer was five or six years.\nThen he asked what could he do to keep my business? It did not seem to occur to him that it might be appropriate to offer a refund for five or six years of fees for a free service.\nThat was 25 years ago. It appears USBancorp has about the same customer nonservice attitude it always did and I do not believe for one minute thier apology and \"that is not us\" claim was not just what the lawyers told them to say.",

But, since banks make money (HUGE money, btw) on overdrafts and floats they have zero incentive to treat their customers appropriately.  2) Despite this, how many people are going to cancel their business relationship with US Bank to send a message? I suspect very, very few.  Really, that's the only message such an org really hears.  When customers run out the door, behavior changes.  Not until.",

I live on a fixed income.  While I can only offer small amounts of money, I will readily help someone else by providing a service that I know would be beneficial to the recipient.  It could be babysitting services, working on the funeral committee lunches at my church, giving a ride to someone unable to drive, provide a meal, watch their animal, water their plants, etc.  Many people have helped me when needed.  We should not expect something in return for the kindness we offer, or even a pat on the back.  We are not in this world alone.

My husband and I decided 10 or 15 years ago to move from BofA to a smaller bank, for ethical reasons. We went to U.S.Bank first (our options are limited in our smallish town).

I asked how can any company justify using our money for a week, and not let us access it, while they use it to invest, or show a net reserve amount nation wide?  She shrugged.\n\nNow the end of this story is that we had the resources to leave money in our BofA account, so we had money to live off and access (which many people would not have that luxury), so we were able to regroup without hardship - except for the loss of time.\n\nWe found another bank that was far more fund friendly, closed our account with U.S. Bank and moved on.\n\nMy best wishes to Emily James and Abigail Gilbert.

You should be able to know the first and last name of anyone who is representing the company you are dealing with where they are and whether or not they are a direct employee of that company or some randomly assigned person from an answering service. \nCorporate America rakes in hundreds of millions illicitly from us because of the shams they get away with using \"call centers\".  It's like deliberately not crediting your account when they open your payment and waiting 5 days or more so they can tack on a late fee. That is just one way they use intentional mismanagement to rip us off and hide behind upthrown hands and \"what can id do that's how call centers work?\" as if they weren't designed to cause exactly that and other problems to the corporations benefit. \n\nYou used to be able to deal with a person directly and get that same person when you called back even in our government!\n\nThe real objection was not only to the compassion but to the idea that the problem could be solved at all in any way other than the destroy your feeling of certainty and reliability in your banking relationship way it was designed to.",

The media did its job, and the mistake was corrected.\nI do have one more question though: Why could'nt Ms. James just deposit the money in the account as cash, rather than driving out to give personally ?",

I called Blue Cross/Blue Shield one minute after it opened the next morning and a human answered the phone.  She immediately recognised my mistake, and after a few 'Oh dears\", asked me to fax her a letter, dictated what the letter should say and said she would take care of it.  She did all of that.  I no longer remember her name, I did send her flowers and she did tell me that I didn't have to do that. I was unable to walk at the time, but that woman saved me and in turn changed my life.

It is the Jungle all over again. \n\nIt's not a surprise that \"Business Ethics\" as taught at business schools, is not  a core course at best and an oxymoron at worst. A bit like \"compassionate conservatism\".\n\nWhy is anyone still surprised by these stories?",

This officer claimed that no payments had been made when in fact the trustee had faithfully made the payments on time\ufffc.  Even when the local bank called and assured this officer that the payments had been made he still insisted that nothing had been paid\ufffc.  The trustee then chose to take out the money from savings and pay the loan in full.  In a tiny town with only one bank, the church really didn\u2019t have much choice but at least one elder no longer has his family\u2019s account there.  And since I\u2019m planning on moving back to the area within the next year, this new story helps make up my mind that I won\u2019t be opening an account at US Bank even if I have to drive a bit more.#",

Lots of cats were turned out onto the streets, where they had a better chance at surviving: I know, because I have rescued some of these cats. \n\nThe people who run this country now are basically evil, and I hope to see the death of capitalism here in my lifetime, even if it takes a civil war to do it.

After she left for the car he went back into the movie to watch the second showing.  Two security guards saw him and went after him and told him he had to leave because he didn\u2019t have a ticket.  He didn\u2019t understand and resisted, the two guards tried to drag him out and put a choke hold on him and they killed the young man.   All for the price of a $10.00 movie ticket.   If they were problem solvers they could have just bought the young man a ticket.  He had Down\u2019s Syndrome and didn\u2019t understand.  The two security guards were off duty police officers moonlighting.  It makes me sad to think of this, it was so unnecessary.

Exceptions to the rules have to be considered carefully. Even a patently generous act can bring problems. \n\nLong ago, I worked as a counselor at a shelter for runaway teens. We routinely and officially gave out clean socks to the kids, but one morning we were one pair short. I took off my shoes and gave my own socks to the remaining teen (figuring that I was leaving soon anyway and would have fresh socks on my feet within the next hour). He said something like, \"Wow--that shows that you really care about us. Not many counselors would do that.\" I immediately realized the problem. If the \"caring\" counselors are the ones who give up their own socks, where does the job end, and who can sustain it? No one criticized me for what I did, but it stayed as a question in my mind.",

All income must be taxed the same, whether from actual labor or financial manipulation.  There must be regulation that protects people and the environment.  If Trump and the Republicans are not soundly defeated it will only be further decline into decay and decadence.  Sadly, it is likely to be that downhill slide.

Mr. Eugenio\u2019s difficulty accessing his money, if media reports are correct, is the result of errors made by local branch employees in Oregon (and the fact that no Branch Manager was available to approve any kind of exception).  Recently US Bancorp cut the number of branch employees enterprise wide; in my opinion, had Mr. Eugenio\u2019s local branch been fully staffed and a Branch Manager present, this whole sorry situation could have been avoided.\n\nTapping my own experience managing call center employees, I can think of at least a dozen other, better courses of actions available to executives once they learned of Ms. James\u2019 good deed.  None of those options would have necessitated her dismissal.  US Bancorp\u2019s policies are less at fault here than is the organization\u2019s culture, a culture born of the beliefs of bank executives that neither value nor trust the front line employees that interact daily and directly with US Bancorp customers.  The shortcomings of US Bancorp\u2019s corporate culture have now been laid bare for the public to see.

The customer had been offered a \"partial credit\" by other representatives, but it clearly stated in the notes that the (Verizon) representative he spoke to had said his data was unlimited. I was livid we hadn't fully credited him. Despite this, the director - when I put the customer on hold and explained the situation and the notes on the account - told me to \"negotiate.\" I was furious. NEGOTIATE, when WE were the ones who told him he had unlimited data? NO WAY. Knowing that we had given misinformation, I got back on the line and told the customer he would be receiving a FULL refund. The customer doubted me, so I sent him an email (company policy was: if we send an email to the customer, whatever is in the email, the company MUST honor).  I submitted a full credit request for the customer's data charge. I could not believe the lack of integrity. They never approached me about it (a wise move on their part: I was not know to back down on such issues). Verizon also touts itself as having \"integrity.\" This is the same company that once let the customer pay the bill up to midnight at the end of the bill cycle. They now charge a late fee if you pay your  bill later than 24 days after billing  cycle date.",

However, it didn't go that way and I was shocked when the employee and her supervisor were fired.

If the Bank doesn't truly learn from this experience, then many citizens will continue to turn away from it.\n\nI still have funds at USBank, but will be watching very carefully to see how the CEO and lower managers handle this situation going forward.",

When I arrived in New York for classes I only had an apartment, but only $70 in my pocket. I had bought a bag of rice and a bunch of beans to get through the first few weeks. I had no money for textbooks.\n\nThat week, an administrative assistant in my Physics department named Jackie asked me how I was settling in and whether I needed anything. I casually wondered if it was possible to get my stipend early, but inside I was panicking. A day or so later, Jackie handed me an envelope with $300 telling me it was from a fund for needy students having special financial issues. That got me through the first month and enabled me to buy some textbooks.\n\nI found out later that there was actually no special fund and that Jackie had helped me out of own pocket. \n\nI've told that story many times and never once has anyone expressed dismay about an employee crossing an invisible line of professionalism. \n\nHelping those in need is a natural thing we do because, at some point, we have all been or will have been in need. Most of us, at one time or another, have helped a stranger in some significant way. \n\nHelping others is just a way of showing gratitude and affirming that helping those in need is a virtue to be extolled, not to be punished. \n\nIndividuals who have never experienced privation are less likely to develop empathy for those in need, and more likely to resent those who express it.",

The bank has welcomed the millions of personal and business dollars I've passed through my accounts over the years but doesn't register who I am nor even bother to greet me as a person when I have any issue outside their electronic protocols.\n\nMy reservoir of loyalty is gone and I wouldn't mind if they dried up and blew away.

I opened a deposit account in the local Lloyd\u2019s of London to keep my personal money safe. My parents had their bank wire transfer a small allowance for me regularly. It was a 3-day \u201cbank holiday.\u201d I went to Lloyd\u2019s to withdraw funds for the weekend; my rent and two meals per day were provided, but I would need some extras spending money. I knew there wasn\u2019t much in my account, and I needed to keep that deposit to hold my account open. My parents\u2019 wire transfer, of $50 (it was 1969!), would have come through. But it didn\u2019t. There was some problem with the wire. So...no funds available. Like the naive 20-year-old that I was, I plead my case to the teller. So sorry, was the reply, you will have to wait. I returned to my student digs and figured I could stretch my remaining few pounds. A short time later, my landlady called me downstairs. At the door was another teller from Lloyd\u2019s. Handing me a ten pound note, he said he overheard my attempted transaction, and, having recently been a student himself, on a strict budget, he wanted to help. He said he had checked my account and saw the regular wire transfers, and that I could just repay him the following week, which I did. It was an act of kindness I remember to this day. As far as I know, no one got in trouble. U. S. Bank should be ashamed.",

Despite the branch manager's desire to be helpful, he was aghast that a month after accepting a check Citibank had not released funds for the new account. Frustrated, I went to a local US Bank, and the experience was so much better. That branch manager took care of everything that very afternoon, including making sure funds were available from a deposited check the very next day. ... Fast forward to today. Last week we deposited a check, and the bank insisted on a huge delay before the funds would be cleared. The current branch manager was very unhelpful. He \"explained\" that I had \"agreed\" to the delay -- as if the depositor has any choice in the matter. I asked if he could accelerate things, and told him how helpful the previous branch manager had been. He explained: \"things have changed ... If I do something for you, I'll get fired. Will you find find me another job?!\"",

But there is another issue that is glossed over in the story, the issue of Mr. Eugenio's limited skill handling his own money.  The story reports--accurately, I assume--that he deposited a $1,080 paycheck and the bank put a hold on \"most\" of the money.  Consider why the bank would do that.  Clearly, the \"paycheck\" was not a regular payment made by an established employer, or else the entire amount would have been available immediately.  Clearly, too, the hold was for a set period known to Mr. Eugenio when he deposited the check.  Clearly, too, Mr. Eugenio did in fact get some money which he immediately spent without putting any aside to buy gas for his car or presents for his children.  Also clearly, Mr. Eugenio did not have a credit card.  Mr. Eugenio had never learned to budget his money in order at the very least to have an amount in savings readily available on his next payday so he could \"cash\" his own check and deposit the new check for as long a \"hold\" as the bank wished.  And by the way, if Mr. Eugenio had such an account the bank would not have placed a hold in the first place.  I care a lot about the unthinking spendthrifts among us, partly because some training can fix the problem and partly because I myself was once one of those unthinking spendthrifts.",

I generally enjoy your reporting, but this is plain silliness.  I am willing to bet that she wasn't fired for this act of kindness.  Consider another narrative.  Do you think US Bank fired a great employee in a tight job market because she treated a  customer with tremendous service?  Of course not.  You give warnings to good employees because they are teachable and too difficult to replace.  Maybe, just maybe, US Bank seized the opportunity to terminate a problem employee that broke protocol as silly as the protocol seems with this set of facts.  As bad as you would like to make US Bank out to be, I suspect they terminated a problem employee without any consideration that she would go to the press with a one-sided story.  If she was a good employee, she would go get another job as bank jobs are plentiful.  If she was a bad employee, it's tougher for her to find a job, so she goes to the press.  Hmmm . . .",

But he said that he accepted ownership of the problems, noted that companies make mistakes and added, \"I will fix this.\" He has already telephoned Emily James and is also reaching out to Abigail Gilbert, the other employee who was fired. I'm feeling optimistic that they will be offered reinstatement, and this particular story may end well. But at the end of the day, everything was going horribly until the column went online. And writing NY Times columns is not a scalable solution to the much broader problem of companies mistreating employees.

What if a passenger lets the pilot know that a close relative needs her immediate assistance and he/she decides to divert the plane as a gesture of kindness? Chances are that pilot would get fired. I can already feel the mob coming after me just for questioning and seeking debate.",

No, but we moved our finances to a non-profit mutual bank.

Suppose Ms. James had a supervisor and HR director who were as kind hearted as she is and gave her the promotion and raise you suggest. How would bank profits have possibly suffered? Indeed, they may have improved, as Mr. Eugenio, Ms. James and others shared the great Christmas story that happened and more customers decided they wanted to do business with a caring bank like that. \n\nThe bank hold itself is unconscionable; the only purpose is to increase the bank's bottom line by adding several days of interest. Same with those outrageous overdraft fees - a split-second blip on a computer somehow became a way to rob the poorest customers of enormous sums of cash, creating a giant new profit center. Latest figures show banks collected $11.45 billion in overdraft fees in one year. While CEOs like Mr. Cecere are busy decrying higher taxes for the wealthy, his bank is happily collecting huge sums from the poor. \n\nCallous, inhuman behavior like this is what the CFPB was designed to address, and was doing a good job of accomplishing before the current administration tied its hands. This is just one more reason to vote blue this fall - we have to make some serious adjustments to our priorities in this nation.",

I am sorry she lost her job and has yet to find another one.  Statistics of low unemployment don't tell the whole story.\n\nUsbank does maintain several \"branches\" in small towns across their region.  Single employees can be alone at these branches especially during holidays.  They might well have given Mr. Eugenio money from their own pockets under the circumstances of Holiday Goodwill.  However, branch employees have more authority than call center employees.\n\nMs. James might have been more successful in helping Mr. James if she had been able to contact a local charity, church or even the law enforcement in the town where Mr. Eugenio was stranded. As do many of the readers of this column, I wish her success in obtaining another job.\n\nThis incident points out why bank employees need a union to represent them against the power of large banks in charge of their employment.",

This is for the protection of all of the employees of the call center.  As an employee, I appreciated these policies.  The vast majority of callers are good people and I worked hard to provide them with accurate information and the best help possible.  There were also callers who were downright scary in their hatefulness.\n\nI certainly understand Ms. James' desire to help Mr. Eugenio.  I have given cash to a stranger at a gas station who needed help to get back home.\n\nMs. James was probably fired for violating a policy that is there for the protection of the employees.  The call center I worked for had 1,000s of employees in multiple states, and policies were strictly enforced across all sites for all employees.  While this led to good people I knew losing their jobs (very sad and unfortunate) it also guaranteed fairness for all employees.  We knew the rules and the consequences for breaking those rules.\n\nI wish Ms. James all the best and hope this leads to a better future for her.  In my 50 plus years of working various jobs, the call center job was overall the most difficult and stressful.\n\nI am commenting to hopefully provide a little bit of perspective in the reason she lost her job.",

My mortgage payments were up to date when I made this principal payment, so they then created an escrow account to deposit my payment in. I pointed this out to them and to my other bank, who saw the error and immediately cancelled the check payment. Meanwhile US Bank did not respond or admit the error but instead charged me a penalty (added to my mortgage amount) for a stop payment on the check. Being charged a penalty for their error did not sit well with me, so I fought them tooth and nail for weeks. They finally, without apologizing, sent me a letter saying the penalty had been retracted.\nI don\u2019t want to go to the expense of refinancing my mortgage just to get rid of this heinous company, and even then I could not control to whom the mortgage is sold, but I have considered it.",

I have been with mine for over 30 years, five years working abroad, and seven years traveling by RV throughout Canada and the USA.  Rarely ever a problem. Outstanding service with people who care.  It's the only financial institution I use with the exception of credit cards. (Yep! I realize that's another group to be cautious about.)\n\nBanks in our country like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, US Bank or countless others, do not cater to the working  class. As a result their accounts have high maximum fees whenever possible, including late fees, check fees, loan fees, poor saving interest, etc. \n\nThey are there primarily for business, making big profits, and are partially responsible for the 2008 financial crisis.

In a year when we are being pummeled with appalling news each and every day, this story takes the cake for showing how  gratuitously cruel and heartless corporate America can be to both its clients and its employees.   Banking services are often generic.  Clients of this bank should pull their accounts and look for a bank that treats employees and clients fairly.",

I hope she soon gets a good job offer from one of the companies mentioned at the end of the article. \n\nIt doesn't matter whether it was James's $20 or someone else's. Either way, she conveyed it to Mr. Eugenio with permission.  They can't have it both ways. Either she misled the manager or the manager gave her the money, indicating that the manager understood the request.  \n\nJames is the kind of caring employee I would hire and she's also the kind of customer call center employee I want to deal with when I have a problem.",

I live in the NYC suburbs and there are help wanted signs everywhere.  Unskilled work generally goes for around $15 per hour around here if it doesn't involve heavy labor- not that that sum gets one out of poverty.  \n\nI absolutely agree with every conclusion Kristof draws from the story,  however.  The main problems about the politics of the moment is that they are being manipulated by big money to make bigger money as less goes to labor and ever higher proportions go to investors.  \n\nKristof's reporting is important, but I doubt a change will occur by pulling people's heartstrings alone.  A fundamental change will be required of our entire political system.\n\nMany people believe serious campaign finance reform will have to come first.  We should be campaigning for a constitutional amendment as a kind of focal point and encourage candidates to talk more about the issue.\n\nThe thing is, how to prioritize when our planet is on fire and our president is a criminal- convicted or not.",
