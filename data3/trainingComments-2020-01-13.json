Vladimir Putin can end Trump's presidency with one phone call to the NYTimes or Washington Post, so he's forced to do Putin's bidding.  \n\nHe needs to keep his base riled up so that if he loses the election, he can claim voter fraud and threaten insurrection or even outright civil war.  He is grooming the public for a news blackout--it's been over 300 days since a press conference.  If he decides to shut down CNN and MSNBC on the grounds that they're \"Enemies of the People,\" AG Barr will back him up and Fox News will herald his leadership.\n\nIt's really not any more complicated than that.",

Until we arrive at the present day, where we find a supremely unworthy man suddenly given these cumulative powers, and the only thing keeping check on his nonexistent discretion is a cabal of self-interested men who believe they can exploit the chaos he creates for personal or political gain.\n\nTrump's impeachment and removal from office would end the imminent threat he poses to our democracy, but it would not repair our democracy. To ensure another Trump does not happen the presidency's power must be truncated back to a reasonable level.\n\nI work in tech, and in tech when a bad actor finds a weakness in a system that allows them to wreak havoc, the incident is not considered closed until that weakness is identified and fixed.

So what's happens next? The crisis does not end, it simply enters a new phase.\n\nIf an impeached Trump is then re-elected, the nation will have to consider impeachment all over again. This is not a process that can be derailed by the idea \"the people have spoken\" because Trump will still be a threat to the stability and survival of America. If Trump were to be put back in office with a majority in both houses of Congress, the crisis would enter its most dangerous and destructive phase.

The authors correctly note that Trumps\u2019s \u201cscandal [is] less because of the specific acts Mr. Trump took than because of why he took them.\u201d\nIt is surprisingly easy to prove motive because it is just a mental impression of common feelings well described by Harvard Psychologist, B.F. Skinner. Left leaning jurists have long allowed circumstantial evidence of character and unrelated bad acts to taint factfinders. The alternative to judging motives is to judge behavior. It is surprisingly difficult to prove what is harmful because it requires a consensus about evil and an acceptance of a limited government role in the process.\nJudging all things by keeping the good and avoiding every kind of evil is a fine way to judge just about everything. Knowing what is evil requires only a standard of love but the application demands great deference to private freedoms. The government, including congress, has no business judging Mr. Trumps motives or vision of Executive power. We have elections for that judgment.",

Thus the oath of office taken by new presidents links the chief executive's powers to the authority of the Constitution.   In this way we seek to distinguish between the office and the personal interests of the officeholder.\n\nIn practice, of course, few officials at any level entirely fulfill the demands of this rigorous ideal.  In ways small or great, most will sometimes confuse their own interests with those of the people they serve.  As the authors stress, however, Trump has elevated such corruption to a philosophy of government.  Even Nixon sought to conceal his misdeeds, but Trump sneers at his critics and celebrates his immunity from the rules and norms that restrain other officials, boasting that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing the support of his followers.\n\nThe danger posed by such open contempt for the core values of our constitutional system centers on the precedent Trump's behavior  sets.  If he avoids conviction and wins reelection, then future candidates for a wide variety of offices will compete in an environment corrupted by a sense that the old rules no longer apply.  That legacy, more than Trump's behavior in office, will stamp his administration as transformative.  The fame and immortality he seeks will be assured.",

What makes it all the more chilling is that these overt steps are not some secret, overt thing that no one is prepared for or can't see, quite the contrary. The path this President is walking is a path identified in nearly every dystopian film and novel ever created.\n\nFrom Fahrenheit 451, the Handmaid's Tale, and 1984 to Star Wars, the Hunger Games and on and on, the dystopian future state -- where a dictator's main goal is self interest, control and holding on to power -- always begins and carries on through fear, lies and and misinformation.\n\nAnd perhaps even worse, those lies and that fear are promulgated by others who recognize that the leader is lying, but who -- for whatever reason -- like the lies because the lies benefit them.

This process created a presidential office ripe for a corrupt holder to seize its powers for personal gain. In other words, the problem is not just Trump's \"vision\" of his office as a means for personal aggrandizement; getting rid of him will not solve the underlying problem that provided him the means to act as he has. If we truly want to prevent future Trumps, we must squarely face the imperial presidency built in the last century and expanded in this (George W. Bush). It must be demolished and restored to an office whose powers are restricted by the re-establishment of a balance with the rest of the government.",

We do have an estimate, though. Back in February 2017, Gail Collins quoted Trump as complaining in the past that the Obama's spent too much time on vacation, with their Christmas stays in Hawaii costing the taxpayers $4 million each time. Ms. Collins estimated that a weekend at Mar-a-lago cost the government $3 million. The Obama's took 2 vacations a year: Hawaii at Christmas and Martha's Vineyard in August. That's 16 vacations over 8 years times $4 million=$64 million, which equals 21 weekends at Trump resorts at $3 million each. So in less than a year, Trump spent as much on his mini vacations as the Obama's did over an entire two terms. Truly a man of the people, Trump is.

A product of assigning market value to a necessity the same way it does to a commodity.\n\nThe singular goal of a health insurance company is to make profit. Every health service available through the company is centered around it's profitability. So when someone looks at that system, looks at the health insurance industry raking in billions of dollars only to turn around and deny coverage, deny life saving medicine, and throw cancer patients into bankruptcy, and then says \"yeah lets keep that part!\" is absolutely operating as a corporate tool. \n\nThey're defending a system designed to keep money in the pockets of huge companies and out of the pockets of sick Americans. How one can, from a moral standpoint, defend the commodification of life saving medicine as an optional good to a sick or dying child, adult, elderly person or anyone between, to me, explicitly makes them a corporate tool. \n\nTo be told that the \"extreme\" view is to say someone should not die because they can't afford insulin, shows how mindlessly brainwashed society has become into serving their corporate overlords who feed them misinformation so as to protect themselves from the power of your vote.",

Medicare for All would eliminate from the damages recoverable in such suits the cost of medical care for injuries received in an accident due to the negligence.  All charges for medical treatment and care are recoverable as damages in lawsuits, since under current law the injured plaintiff is legally obligated to ensure payment to medical providers for past and future expenses of care.  Such medical expenses but would not be recoverable if the costs of that care are no longer the obligation of the injured party to pay, but are rather paid by the federal government as a matter of right.\n\nAlso under current law, the past and future medical expense damages paid by defendants are shared with the attorneys for the injured, with the injured receiving only 60% of those costs for care.  With Medicare for All, the injured will be assured of full medical treatment without concern for having to share the recovery, or for running out of money for future care.\n\nPersonal injury lawsuits would still go forward for recovery of damages for pain and suffering, loss of quality of life, and similar claims.  But without need to litigate past and future medical expenses, the cost of bringing and defending such suits would be substantially reduced.  Liability insurance premiums should drop commensurately.",

Seems wonderful compared with previous double digit %'s, but with inflation running in the 2-3% range even 7% yearly  is not sustainable long term . Ultimately health care needs to return to the marketplace, patients paying for their own care in a competitive market. Those who can't afford need government sponsored financial coverage and even those who can on a day to day level need some sort of government sponsored catastrophic financial insurance to guard not against the inevitability of medical issues but against their power to destroy people financially. We have the finances to do this. One thing the Europeans prove is that better health care can be delivered at about half the price. As Americans I think we can do even better.

It will come to pass.\n\nOf course if it's to happen in the near term, it means ACA's obstructionists are voted out of office and replaced with leadership that puts us on a path to immediately improving health care for all Americans, and extending it to those millions who were blocked from its benefits.\n\nOf course it presumes a change in Leadership in the Oval Office and Senate. But it's not far fetched really. In could happen right?",

First, for Mr. Trump, its nickname is \"Obamacare.\"  Anything positive associated with the former president means it has a target on it for  destruction by Mr. Trump.  \n\nSecond, the super-wealthy, and even just the plain wealthy  who support the GOP are incensed that they should in any way pay for the health of the poor, let alone the rank and file working class.  If Mr. Trump prevails, and the GOP gains control of the House and Senate (not totally far-fetched), you'll see a tightening of the already meager SNAP (food stamp) program, the elimination of Obamacare, and drastic changes to  Medicaid (which has already taken its lumps), Medicare, and Social Security.\n\nAnd while we're at it, if the unions who support Mr. Trump and the GOP think they're going to benefit from their re-election, they're dreaming.  If the Republicans had their way, unions as we know them would not exist.  And, traditionally, it was unions that fought for health benefits from employers, as well as federal programs like Medicare and Social Security.\n\nAnd if you think states will fill in the blanks when Obamacare is scuttled, think again.  GOP legislators here in Florida promised \"something better\" when they refused Federal Medicaid funding.  We're still waiting for that one.  Only Massachusetts will have a viable healthcare system, because they had one prior to the ACA.",

Further, it\u2019s operationally manufactured health care into a product offered in a consumer marketplace.  Health care now less about patient and doctor than it is about the rules, regulations, restrictions imposed by insurers. It was legislation crafted under the advisement of health insurance executives and lobbyists. The program\u2019s name, the Affordable Care Act, is itself an ironical nomenclature as it\u2019s a national health program where those that have the financial means can buy into plans with the fewest restrictions and widest access to medical providers, health services and goods.

Polls aren't always to be trusted, of course (even Nate Silver got it wrong in 2016).\n\nBut more people want Trump ousted before November than mainstream news networks let on...\n\nLast night, for example, we learned that the Russians are now brazenly trying to help him get re-elected in 2020 (by hacking into Burisma's data base, ostensibly to find \"dirt\" on the Bidens). The Russians don't even bother trying to hide their U.S.-election meddling anymore.\n\nAnd just this morning, we learned that Trump is diverting $7.2 billion in Congressionally-approved Pentagon funds for his border wall - a project I could actually support if it's tied to large infrastructure spending - but this again is even more blatant evidence of a rogue President flouting Congress.\n\nIn the end, impeaching Trump and making an effort to remove him from office is at least equally as important as healthcare and national security precisely because he is a threat to both. His impeachable activity will not likely cease unless and until he is removed by the Senate or the voters, or failing either of those eventualities, if both Chambers are controlled by Democrats again.",

With Trump you know you are getting a master b/s artist  which is a contrast to the usual prevaricating politician. Trump may liberally spurn the truth, but his right wing  adherents believe he is true to their core values.\nBernie in some way is the Trump of the left.. a demagogue appealing to the dreams and anxieties of his liberal constituency. Unlike Trump, who promises \u201cthe best healthcare ever\u201d with no existing details or costs that could be revealed, Bernie has \u201cwritten the damn law\u201d but has  not been forthright on the cost of all his proposals. That cost places Bernie\u2019s left field ideas in the field of dreams.\nBernie should be questioned as to how \u201ceverything for all\u201d will be paid for;  I wonder  if he answers  that \u201cMexico will pay for it.\u201d\n\n*now that he is available, Klobuchar should form a team wih Corey Booker now and start campaigning on a platform of unity,reality, practicality, effectiveness, experience, diversity, and empathy. This is an appealing contrast to our current maniacal Divider in Chief and the members of the Democratic \u201cdream\u201d team of candidates.",

The quarter that thinks it is a luxury are mostly republicans who are covered by good insurance plans and who do not know what it is to go into an emergency room having no or nearly worthless coverage. The republican myth that americans want the government to stay out of health care is one of the favorite lies.\n\nWhen republicans sell the right to not be insured they are addressing people that seem to feel that all government activities and regulations are bad. They are not mentioning that the \" right to be insured \" already is working for people over 65 on medicare and for the very poor for whom medicaid was created. It is largely the middle class that now finds itself frequently uninsured due to the high cost of insurance or underinsured due to buying cheaper policies that offer terrible coverage.\n\nThe middle class that frequently votes independent or republican has depended on work place insurance but those that could not afford it were helped by Obama care. Today Obama-care may slip into the past however what is still hard to understand is the reluctance of the middle class to see health care as a right. it is possible that they see health care as a right leading to higher taxes or a loss of insurance that they currently have. In either case we remain a country that has yet to offer all its citizens a fundamental right recognized everywhere in the civilized world !",

That system, however, if we look at the model provided by other countries can take many forms but all will require much more governmental input than we currently have.  I think our system has multiple problems - the issue of coverage as Mr Krugman points out but also issues of costs including drugs, coverage in poorly served areas, the cost of medical school which influences doctor career choices.  The government needs to be much more involved in funding for medical education and research to pay for much needed new antibiotics, immunizations and all those new and exciting treatments for \u201crare\u201d diseases and genetic conditions that hold so much promise to improve so many lives.  We also need high quality nutritional research, gun violence research and new paradigms in mental healthcare to address our public health issues of obesity, diabetes, suicide and substance abuse.  We also may well be on the cusp of emerging infectious disease issues due to climate change.  Mr Krugman is right that incremental reform is the best choice for immediate improvements but Mr Sanders and Ms Warren are also correct in that Medicare is already a pretty good system as is the rest of federal healthcare.",

I understand that medical practitioners, hospitals and clinics, etc., must make up some how for the health care they provide to sick folks unable to pay for their services but the monies spent on my health care listed on my monthly reports are beyond absurd. Medicare for all is essential in any modern state but the costs of medical care in these United States most definitely is in need of attention. I am grateful that as a former civil servant in the the state of New York I have excellent medical coverage in my retirement. I am not amused, however, to see medical personnel and agencies take advantage if my benefits to enrich themselves at the tax payers' expense. After all, I am still a tax payer in my retirement.",

Which gives the best trajectory: free, easy healthcare or expensive healthcare that forces people to fear loss of their job (and hence corporation provided healthcare)?\n\nThe central economic problem is to get a precise measure of a desired equilibrium whereby a nation can make an informed decision.  Free healthcare may lead to employees  quitting jobs too easily and flippantly.  Dearly won healthcare may lead to substandard performance and misery, keeping a job they don't like just out of fear of losing healthcare benefits.  In this country, they can also be hobbled by trying to figure out what the benefits are, when they are, for how long, etc. -- 800 number calls, endless.  This seems to be the weakness, for real with healthcare.  It is just too (no expletive used) confusing.\n\nWhat is never mentioned in these opinion pieces is the why business and the Trumps (the GOP) want dearly won, complex healthcare.  They want it because big business, their donors, want to control employees with fear -- not to mention the vested interests healthcare donors.\n\nIf only an economist could put the whole thing into a mathematical relief via a pertinent, well-designed parameter.

The trillion-plus dollar question is how to get there from here.\n\nWe are not going to suddenly convert everything into a single payer system. There are too many stakeholders (unions, people with generous private insurance, and countless people whose jobs in healthcare are threatened). There's also too much inertia and friction to quickly overcome in a very complicated system. Certainly not within one two-year congressional cycle.\n\nAnd the more that voters are disappointed with a system that comes up short, the more likely Republicans take over and sabotage any progress.\n\nSensible measures include expanding Medicaid to every state, providing larger insurance subsidies to more people, limiting deductibles and copays, adding a public option, gov't bargaining for drug prices, limiting payouts for ineffective or overpriced care, and mandating every provider receiving federal money take a certain percentage of insured, low income patients.\n\nBy allowing the public option to compete with private insurance over time, insurance would probably come to cover mostly vanity or boutique options. Of course, any new system will need continued adjustments to control costs and improve efficiency.\n\nI seriously doubt any candidate is going to get single payer healthcare quickly enacted and put in place.

Sibelius, would not get very far. Roberts saved the law, but on grounds both exceedingly narrow and novel. He agreed that it violated Congress's powers under the commerce clause, but justified it under the taxing power. In terms of existing precedent, that was absurd: health insurance is obviously a matter of interstate commerce and choosing to remain out of the market has an effect on interstate commerce. The case of Wickard v. Filburn already settled that private decisions could come under that rubric. Roberts won credit for saving the law when he actually did much to cripple it by removing the penalty on states for not expanding Medicaid. A long established method of federal regulation, making generous grants conditional on what the states do (cf drinking age at 21) suddenly became an affront to \"states rights\".  That arbitrary, poorly reasoned decision is the major reason the ACA did not help millions of people. Under the rules of severability, the current case, Texas v. US, should not be difficult: as you say, this issue is supposed to be determined by congressional intent. But the fuss that has already been made in the lower courts about what should be a non-issue does not bode well for the fate of the ACA in the Supreme Court.

If you had not previously been subscribing to Plan F, you cannot start buying it now.\n\nAnyway, the surge in cost for the additional 20% for current Medicare recipients themselves to have Sanders style \"Medicare for All\" would be enormous.  20% of a very very large number, is still a very large number.\n\nAnd because of their voting strength as seniors, they would be first in line to claim the incremental benefits which would flow, over time, from Sanders style \"Medicare for All.\"",

I.e., it is more expensive to be a doc in San Francisco than in Little Rock.  Congress has been starving the payment system for as long as I remember.

Based on the actuarial axiom that the larger the risk pool the less the risk to any of the individuals in the pool.  So it would seem that we should expand Medicare.

I pay 80 euros a month for a top of the line plan, to supplement my National Health Care. So, national healthcare doesn't eliminate private policies - it just changes the way it works. Like Medicare + Blue Cross. But we choose our private insurance from different insurers. They also insure people who don't have their carte de s\u00e9jour or citizenship.

They don't want to pay for others health care. I venture to write that the wealthy Republicans became wealthy by focusing on themselves to the exclusion of others. It just comes naturally to them to not care and to horde treasure like the pirates they emulate.\n\nPut the \"Care\" back into the discussion of \"Universal Care\". The Democrats always cared about all Americans, but they just don't know how to verbalize it. I don't watch CSpan. Do many? Last I saw it it sounded like a therapy release for the ill. That's how bad things are now. People's happiness and smiles have gone away since Trump ascended to his throne. \n\nI don't like that Billions of campaign dollars enrich the politically coercive Television industry no matter who wins an election.

But it's what we have. \n\nThe Affordable Care Act saved my life. In the runup to the law's passage, I was facing a personal crisis. I was 23, too sick to work, about to get kicked off my student health insurance, and recently diagnosed with a severe autoimmune disease. I called every insurer in California and no one would offer me insurance of any kind, at any price. I couldn't even get a policy that excluded coverage for my pre-existing condition. I felt like the walls were closing in on me, I was so frightened. When Nancy Pelosi came out of conference and announced that she had the votes and the law would pass, I cried. I collapsed on the floor and sobbed for hours, letting out all that terror and stress that had been building inside me for months.\n\nDo we really want to go back to the days when sick people were left to die, unable to get insurance? Trump wants to send us back there, and so does the GOP. Consider - even if you're healthy now, even if you have insurance through your employer, even if you like your insurance, all of that could change in an instant. You could be me, healthy one minute and in crisis the next.  Vote in 2020, because lives depend on it.  Mine does, and one day yours could too.",

We can not go from A to Z without working through the other 24 letters.  Paul mentions the need for the government to be more generous when considering subsidies.  It was indeed working before Trump got his claws into the law.  I would also suggest to resurrect the public option.  It did not make it through the Congress the first time around.  But listening to the voices of the electorate, Republicans and Democrats alike, I would bet that it would find success the second time it is presented.  \n\nNow Trump....I nearly fell out of my chair when he proclaimed that he was \"the person who saved preexisting conditions.\"  The question is does he believe that?  After all, he is so lost within his deviant and ego-consumed mind, that he could live within that fantasy.

As Matt Taibbi writes, quoting Robert Hunter of the Consumer Federation of America, \"If a bunch of construction contractors got together and decided to set the prices of bricks and mortar, they'd all go to prison. But in insurance, it's all legal.\" Taibbi highlights the role of the McCarran-Ferguson act, which set aside the insurance industry from federal regulation. States regulate all cases not applicable under the Sherman Antitrust Act. State regulatory officials have key relationships with hospitals and insurance companies in determining what will be covered and at what price. Yes, healthcare is a business. But this provides an incentive to drive up prices across the board. And Obamacare largely left it intact and thus was only able to slow healthcare costs instead of decrease them.",

Who but Trump can make claims as detached from reality as this without begging this question?  \n\nWill point out incidentally that the \"unpopular\" individual mandate was intended to make the requirement to cover pre-existing illness financially viable for insurance companies so they didn't go bankrupt from people buying insurance on their way to the hospital.  The civil libertarians who feel that this unfairly burdens them are welcome to decline medical care if anything happens to them while uninsured.  If they get sick, they destabilize the system for everyone else since the medical system has to absorb the cost of providing care to the uninsured in most cases -- i.e. it gets shifted on to people with insurance or it puts hospital at risk of not being able to pay their bills.  \n\nOrdinary people do have reason to be angry about health insurance, mandated or not, however since it forces them to pay into a system artificially inflates the cost of virtually every service -- medications, laboratory services, devices, software -- to astronomical levels.

And 71% of all Americans want it, so if it is cheaper and covers more, even the nefarious Koch brothers study showed it to be cheaper so with all that said the only reason it can not be done soon is because of the greedy insurance companies and their bribes. How do you plan we get around them?  I guess what you are saying in order to put patches on Obama care we must give some kind of welfare to the insurance companies to sooth them first , you know like we subsidize oil companies,  I say get money out of politics.

Saving the ACA and calming the markets would require restoring the individual mandate or passing a new law.

I don't want to throw any of it away.\n\nI think what annoyed me was not the movie itself, but the hype that it was the epitome of expression of female experience. Which of course it is not, and can never be.  \n\nWhile it is very important that marginalized people put forth their own stories, I think, as this writer suggests, that we allow ourselves to be moved by the stories that might seem distant from our experience. \n\nThat being said, I have no interest whatsoever in seeing The Irishman. There are some stories that I have seen many times already and need to see no more!  :)",

Second thing is that, for girls, they are highly educated.  Another not common thing at the time.  Next step:  consult wikipedia.\n\nSeems the Alcott girl\u2019s parents were an educator (Dad) and a social worker ( Mom). Alcott\u2019s father moved the family to Boston, from, Pennsylvania, in 1834, where he established an experimental school, and joined the Transcendental Club with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.  Hmmm.  Nice friends to have and they helped the family out with money in a pinch.  Alcott received instruction from writers and educators like Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Julia Ward Howe.\n\nYes, due to \u2018poverty\u2019 the girls had to go to work early as a teacher, seamstress, or domestic helper.

That black women weren't publishing this type of book 100 years ago is important as is the fact that few women were publishing anything.Alcott had to change her ending to be published so this wasn't without cost to her.  As others have noted we read to be informed and changed.  In The Bluest Eye I thrilled to Tony Morrison's words; as a young white middle American girl I devoured Little Women, as a mature woman I was fascinated by Isabel Allende's House of the Spirits but had no experience with South America or magical realism. Regarding the ability of art/plays/books to translate to other cultures we can see that this happens in the production of plays/movies/literature into other languages/in other countries and has happened for years. How wretched the world would be had we not been able to learn from others. It's art not perfection.",

Whites cannot write from a black perspective any more than a straight person can write from a gay perspective or a Muslim from a Christian perspective. I have loved Morrison since I was a child.  And, frankly, I consider her work to be incomparable.  But the truth is that art typically reflects the perspective of its artist.  And whereas it might have been possible for Morrison to have written about white people and their experiences, whites weren't her muse. Whites weren't her perspective, her interest or her expertise.  As a white man, I am grateful that authors and artists in general stick to what they know.  As a reader, I find truth in characters and authors with whom I have nothing in common.

The scene where both white and black people were socializing together at a dance in Concord was preposterous, even if the Marches were abolitionists. Also the shots of well dressed blacks walking casually on the streets of NYC (or was it Boston?) is really just looking back at the 1860s with rose colored glasses. Then the characters were supposed to be teenagers but were played by actresses in their late twenties. The elaborate outfits and drapery on the wall in their attic belie their claim of poverty. This heavy handed story is what Louisa May Alcott at the time felt that she needed write to bend to the demands of her publisher, thus she was coerced into writing what she herself described as, \"moral pap for the young.\" I can't agree more.  The moral of the story is that a woman should not be defined by or be dependent on a man. I get it, but unless we live in Yemen or South Sudan, I cannot find this a revolutionary concept nowadays. In contrast The Netflix series Anne with an E (Anne of Green Gables) written about thirty years later in Eastern Canada just north of New England. It shows a much more nuanced and realistic view of how strained and very odd were inter-racial social interactions at the time. Anne's home made clothing is plain and unadorned in contrast to that of some of her schoolmates. Anne is not described as poor at all. Anne with an E is a far more realistic story.",

One should also keep in mind that the March family was not typical but was instead raising girls in a much freer and more open-minded atmosphere than most. Another point worth noting is the very telling line that Marmee has about being angry every day of her life. This story is not just about a charming girlhood--it is also about how to find your own unique identity and dignity in an often hostile world--surely a topic with wide appeal.\n\nInterestingly, class differences are also on full display in this novel and in its various movie adaptations. The March girls complain constantly about being poor, but they are only poor when compared to friends who are really quite wealthy. They are obviously far better off than the cold, hungry family they help and for that matter, they are far wealthier than their own beloved housekeeper! (Reading this book as a child, I kept wondering how a family that owned a large house in a nice neighborhood, had a housekeeper/cook, and could afford to educate girls at a time when that was not considered a necessity could possibly be considered poor.)",

            "comment_body": "A great article.\n\nLet me say about Greta Gerwig, she is full of great qualities like charm, obvious kindness, decency, sweetness, and attractive. And of course, smart. \n\nBut her appeal is also racial, in her whiteness. But in the same way women of every race can show beauty in that race's particular way. A beautiful black woman or beautiful Asian woman are beautiful in ways particular to those races.\n\nThe \"problem\" with Gerwig and whiteness is something going back to her career launch with Whit Stillman, whose films are all about \"upper class Wasp\" as an ethnic group (his films are like \"ethnographies\" of this group, even with the dialogue having characters self-analyze themselves, often very poignantly, sweetly, honestly, as if it were an anthro class in college); Stillman celebrates this group while showing their limitations, weaknesses etc. fairly honestly. \n\nI see Gerwig as continuing his genre and cultural role in certain ways.\n\nSo it's hard not to be ambivalent about movies being so aggressively white and clearly \"about\" being white, but Stillman and Gerwig pull something like this off because they have hearts and minds that seem to point to something like a post-Post-Racial, founded on a \"loving self\" and \"loving other\" synergy that is racial but not racist. \n\nFor the dynamic I have in mind, ***please*** watch this brief Gerwig-Stillman video. It says it all, good and bad.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alR5PopJW2o&vl=en\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alR5PopJW2o&vl=en</a>",

Ms. Greenridge expresses a firm sense of being a Black woman in America -- a reality I can only glimpse through voices such as hers -- but insists on receiving a work of art on it's own terms and finding her own connections to it where they exist.  The works of James Baldwin and Toni Morrison contain such connections for me.  We are in an era when many are understandably tired of waiting for their particular experience to be depicted and embraced more widely. I  do not counsel patience but expressions of petulant disregard for work like Ms. Gerwig's film do little to further that worthy cause.  It is not enough for a woman's work to to achieve such impact if she's the wrong color?  That sounds as bad now as it did 50 years ago.  Parsing our identities so thinly will not hasten wider appreciation of the diverse glory of our increasingly shared experience.",

This is perhaps the purpose of literature... to remind us of our inescapable humanity, our connectedness and our profound sense of empathy. The structural and purposeful removal of black, brown, ESL, gender queer and female writers from literary criticism causes this lack of empathy that is exemplified in the critical rejection of Little Women in theaters.

American literature has not only prevented women from filling heroic roles, but essentially erased all black people, male and female, from the role of protagonist.  \n\nI'd say the time has come for black women to be recognized as the heroes and leaders they are (and have always been).",

We have come to a pretty sad state when we aren't allowed to like characters who are different from ourselves, not permitted to identify with them, or care about them.  Any movie set, say, more than century ago, is a movie set on a different planet, in the different world.   \n\nI visited the Alcott House, I read the book, I've seen all the movie versions.  That the March sisters are supposed to sum up all American girlhood is a notion I never heard of before reading this column, and certainly never imagined.   To me they represented a very tiny sliver of that pie, though an interesting one.\n\nThat all being said, I didn't care much for this movie version.  The confused chronology spoiled the narrative, and instead of seeing characters who grew and changed, I was left with no clear of who anybody was, even what was real and what was Jo's imagination.   Amy wasn't likable in any version, but in this version I found myself actively disliking her.   Laurie was a mess.  Nobody was much fun.   I came away not caring about any of the characters very much.  \n\nAll which only goes to show that people see things through different lenses.   Every story is universal, and no story is.

It's also a curious fact, documented in their diaries, that Little Women was a favorite book of the Russian Imperial family of Tsar Nicolas. Their copy of the book is in the Library of Congress. It's a historical fact that Russia did not participate in the international, transatlantic slave trade.  The government even made official protests in the day to object to its practice. Russia's most revered poet, Pushkin, was a black man by today's definition. Black people served in the Russian Imperial government and were able to advance in their profession on their merits. Another curiosity is that the women of the Imperial family trained and served as nurses during WW1, as did Louisa Alcott during the Civil war, a profession that was essentially defined and established by Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War, a war that was a humiliating defeat for the Russians, Tsar Nicolas' father.  Florence Nightingale was also a Unitarian, but she was British, an enemy of the Russians during the Crimean war.",

Today, representations of people like me are still 90% sentimental, youth-oriented, formulaic caricatures (e.g. Queer Eye), and the remaining 10% are super-niche (e.g. Tom of Finland!?). When I was growing up in the '70's and '80's, in my New Jersey suburb, all I had was a clinical description of \"homosexuals\" in my parents' sex ed book, which told me that they liked to wear tight pants. Rare news stories were full of mockery at best, murder at worst. \n\nI live in San Francisco, which is about the best place for me to be, but while the community here is full of affinity, it's not so full of actual guidance. We are always having to create the basic structures of life from scratch, inheriting almost no precedents from the society around us. It's exhausting to be a structural pioneer, and a massive disadvantage in any market. \n\nIt's often hard for me to believe that this world is a place I'm  meant to inhabit. In many ways, I don't feel like I've ever really been a person at all.",

They got pidgeonholed on R&B stations and made a fraction of what he makes.  This, I believe, is what leads to objections about cultural appropriation.  Why is JT's version of R&B more worthy of exposure than that of an artist of color?  \n \nSimilarly, there are plenty of skilled authors of color writing important stories that will never be considered classics worthy of attention similar to Little Women because of their perceived limited appeal. I don't recall even one book by an author of any color being taught in my English classes in high school or college. The lack of exposure implies that these stories - these people -  are not as good or valued.\n \nI don't need Little Women to include token POCs; I need people to recognize that other viewpoints are worthy and to give them equal consideration so they, too, get the attention they deserve.

When this book was written, Irish immigrants were just starting to climb the ladder to the American dream.  Signs in store windows, as they later would with no blacks allowed read no Irish need apply.  A very informative book has been written on this historical period called \"How the Irish Became White\" and there is much commentary on how south Boston particularly became a later central locale for anti-black prejudice.

What I longed for was the gender that was ok, just as blue eyes would make a black girl ok in a world that denied her personhood.

I never felt that my culture was inferior, and I easily put myself in the characters' shoes.\nThere is far too much emphasis these days on associating with a particular identity - black, white, female, male, LGBT, trans ... and on insisting that that literature, film and other cultural artefacts reflect EXACTLY our own narrow experience.

Are you offended that Alcott didn't write from the viewpoint of Black girls, include racially diverse characters, that Greta Gerwig made such a film, or that people today see parts of themselves or who they can be in the characters? Perhaps criticism is due to our society for not elevating the lives of Black girls in our literary canon. I hope that Black girls can recognize in the March girls a desire to transcend social limitations to become a writer, painter, self-sufficient, or a proponent of social justice. and that there are often unwanted compromises to attain these goals.",

When truthfully told, the personal resonates with universal truths that transcend things like race.  But to crucify the author and those who faithfully portray her work in plays and movies  is unfair. We cannot undo the truth of an author's story and experience  just to satisfy a politically correct agenda. That would be a distortion, a lie.  What we can do is work hard to bring more stories about the minority experience to life. We have not \"erased\" black culture so much as ignored it for a long time due to a complicated host of factors, many of them not a deliberate act of prejudice.  Mercifully, there are now many books, tv shows and films about the minority experience and culture.  The evolution of enlightenment takes time, and I believe progress is being made in leaps and bounds. But we must stop what has now become a narcissistic preoccupation with race and sex at the expense of truth. Especially if the stories told are universal. I am white and have been moved by many  fine films and books with all black casts and characters. The human truths of these works were not diminished one bit for me just because there were no white characters just for the sake of \"racial balance.\"  And I appreciated that they were historically accurate. We cannot artificially create racial harmony.",

And then to add insult to injury they were denied the opportunity to then assimilate into this new culture into which they were thrown.\nThis is something that is with us today and complicates so much of our identity as Americans, as white, or as black. And it is part of the struggle for equality just as much as voting or economic justice.\nBut the solutions to this should not be the rejection of great literature because it did not include ones ethnic group. I am a lover of nineteenth century Russian literature and yet if jews are mentioned at all it is usually not in a flattering light. Let Little Women stand on it's own and appreciate it for the marvelous work of fiction that it is. We are not so different in our humanness. \nWhat is needed is more literature that enlightens all of us about the African American experience. We don't need to tear down great works of art just because they were written at a time when African Americans were virtually invisible to most white Americans. Rather one should strive to add to the canon. This will not be easy nor will it happen overnight but writers such as Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, James Baldwin and Lorraine Hansberry, among others, are quite a good start.",

It's too easy to create a past where people we admire (Louisa May Alcott and her Jo) appreciate rather than ignore people discriminated against.  It distorts the past.\n\nI've met people who attended integrated schools in the 30s or 40s. The races kept to themselves, such that the memories of these white attendees exclude the black students --- they inhabited completely different worlds despite sharing the same physical space.",

To me, that isn't communication or open thinking. It's dogma. Great costumes. Great acting. However, the show was stilted by the absolutist point of view that \"this is how it is\". No, it isn't.",

Of course, the abolitionist movement is not the theme or subject of that novel.\n\nEvery artist has to choose what to focus on in their work, and Alcott was writing about her girlhood and young adulthood, not her family\u2019s political passions,\n \nGreta Gerwig\u2019s  version of Alcott\u2019s story includes a few (mostly \u201cbackground\u201d) African Americans, however, and a clear statement from Marmee about slavery (I\u2018my ashamed of my country) and a suggestion of the anti-slavery basis of the Civil War.  This is very small in the context of the whole movie, but it is THERE.  \n\nIn a recent NYT article a Latina author described  her own fascination with the March girls.  I loved \u201cHeidi\u201d as a child and was delighted to meet an African American neighbor who had also loved it.  Books transport us into other people\u2019s realities.  \n\nIt is wonderful to see more and more worlds represented, but it is easy to forget that some books like Little Women were radical in their \u201ctreatment\u201d of under-represented \u201crealities\u201d (women\u2019s lives and ambitions) for their time.",

This is not to say there is a problem with white and upper class people making films, but we should allow for a larger variety of voices and socioeconomic perspectives, generally, in mass-market films. \n\nOn the side of satire, however - The ideal women to be portrayed on screen, if left exclusively in the hands of those that preach political correctness to the utmost degree, would recast in place of the current leads, transgendered pan-sexual Ugandan refugees.  Which, of course, would not make much sense in the context of 'little women', unless you spent a little too much time inhaling the self-important fumes in the meat-packing district.\n\nInclusiveness for the sake of inclusiveness often equates in fetishism of the other, which is fundamentally reductive.",

I think Alcott used the term \"Little Women\" not to say that these girls represent \"all\" women, but that girls should be taken seriously in the first place -- that the seeds of the adults they will be are already present in them. \n\nSo yes, let's see more stories about young black women. Yes, let's see more stories about gay teens, trans adults, people on the margins, immigrants. \n\nBut let's also not forget that, according to Vanity Fair, the 2019 Little Women struggled just to get men in the Hollywood Academy to even attend their screenings. \n\nCelebrating that movies about women get made and are successful is not the same as saying that they are enough, or that they are the final word on any topic. It's that getting any word in edgewise in a cinematic universe that's been dominated by white male stories for decades feels like a win.",

I wish there had been greater diversity in the books that were available to me as a child, and I am grateful that my grandchildren have this advantage.

It expresses them well and is thought provoking. Good writing is good writing. To assume that one can only write stories about our individual race, sexual orientation, country of origin or whatever is to severely curtail creative thought. Are white people only permitted to read stories about white people written only by white people? Should black people only read books about black people written by black people? Asians only by and about Asians? Men only by and about men etc? I can read James Baldwin or Walter Mosley or Octavia Butler and appreciate them even as a white suburban woman. Men write about women, women about men and it can be a window on how one is perceived by the other, or it could just be a really good story.",

Anything by dead white people, especially dead white men, is verboten.  \nThis is a disaster for human intelligence and wisdom.  First is the obvious point that one doesn\u2019t have to be a feudal Danish Prince, Scottish colonel or Venetian moor to enjoy Shakespeare, or (for that matter) male to feel Ophelia\u2019s anguish; the whole idea of a canon is a common human mythology that simultaneously facilitates understanding, communication and art.  Fiercely-competing separate tribal mythologies are a disaster.  I deeply regret my own and my children\u2019s blue eyes, with the accompanying heightened risks to vision, but I can enjoy Morrison\u2019s work notwithstanding, as I can delight in the Arabian Nights and the Tale of Genji.  \nSecond is a shocking failure to grasp the obvious point that dead white males over-populate the literary and scientific canons because they were the only ones in the room, so to speak, during the centuries when it was created; random chance that will sort itself out over time, not genetic virtue.  We don\u2019t scrutinize Salk\u2019s ethnicity and genetics before taking antibiotics to fight a life-threatening infection, nor should we reject the best of half a millennium's literature out of a bizarre preoccupation with tribal competition.",

Most pieces of fiction will by necessity be about a specific world view; in fact it is pretty much impossible for an individual piece of fiction to perform an in-depth survey of a wide range of world views simply because fiction usually needs to focus on a particular set of characters/place/theme/etc, which inherently constrains the range of experience that is explored.\n\nAt the end of those who complain about a piece of media focusing on white characters (or those from another privileged demographic) aren't really addressing the real problem. The real problem isn't that media focusing on white characters gets made, it's that media focused on characters who aren't white gets produced/published/hyped at a lower rate because of bias against these stories. Pointing out that one individual piece of media focuses on white characters is usually completely orthogonal to the real problem. I guess people find it easier to deal with a single anecdote rather than to try to look at the data, which is where the story really is.",

Since I couldn't befriend a black child, I tried to find books about black children at the library, but there were none to be checked out. So, during the summers, I wrote my own \"novels\" in pencil on lined paper about the adventures of black children. They had the same 'clubs,' loving parents, and skinned knees that I had. I still have those little novels, though the words are fading and the paper is yellowed, and when I re-read them recently, I realized I'd created an unreal world: the characters I'd created had libraries, good schools, restaurants. It was a world that mirrored my own. Jim Crow created such a horrible separation of races that it kept white children shamefully ignorant of the violent realities of racism. Not until a few years later did we realize that our black counterparts did not even have libraries. . .",

Haislip tells of Lottie's escape from enslavement as part of the self-emancipation movement that historians increasingly recognize--but that the public mostly doesn't yet recognize--as having forced transformation of the Civil War into a struggle for freedom. \n\nNo one should fault the 1619 Project for demanding truth-telling about a quarter-millennium and more of crimes against humanity, though some critics have been doing something along those lines. But at the same time, more people should respect the brave initiative and black agency through which people like Lottie forced the transformation.\n\nLottie's courage sustains her in a long, perilous escape to freedom at Fort Monroe, which in real life was the Union's mighty, and mighty symbolic, bastion in Confederate Virginia. \n\nThe 1619 Project knows Fort Monroe as Point Comfort, but the project unfortunately sees it mostly as the place where slavery began--even though it's also the place where self-emancipators forced slavery to begin to crumble. \n\nYes indeed, let's see \"an invitation to creation, not an end to conversation.\"",

Some commentators here suggest that because they themselves can make the leap to any sort of protagonist in a novel, it must be that anyone can do so. Not so; it's a skill that comes with extensive reading, and the data show that our young people (of any race) very often fall short of proficiency and don't read much. Having protagonists transparently similar to the reader and having empathy flow both ways (to quote Ms. Greenidge) are necessary to developing readers who can reap the benefits of a broad range of fiction.",

I knew only a little bit about the American Civil War when I first read it, so I didn't fully appreciate the context, but regardless for me the central draw was Jo, and it never even occurred to me to think that she was white - she was a tomboy, and a bookworm, and loved words, and felt keenly the injustices of being a woman in a man's world - and I saw myself in her, and LOVED the book (and wanted to smack Amy and thought Laurie was a silly clueless boy and found Beth too annoyingly good to be true, etc.). In other words, the book was a central part of my early years as a reader, as were the Little House books (and Black Beauty, and the Black Stallion books, and Enid Blyton) - with main protagonists all whiter than white for the most part - but so were the great Indian stories, Norse mythology, Russian fairy tales, the Grimms, Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. My point is that great literature, whether children's or otherwise, transcends race and country and speaks directly to our imaginations - and if we couldn't see ourselves in those characters, then it would be a sad thing indeed. \n\nHaving said that, we do need more black voices on the page and on the screen (I've lived here more than half my life now, and I see that most white Americans are blind to the true history and continuing reality of racial injustice in America) so this is a good conversation to have.",

Interestingly, maybe because the school system where I attended High School was hugely, predominately, black and latino (as in: you could count the white kids, of which I was one, in one hand)  we also read Richard Wright, Frederick Douglass, Sandra Cisneros, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Sherman Alexi, Lorraine Hansberry, August Wilson, James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison. I believe my conception of literature and life has been enriched by these readings. I am shocked that American children do not read these books, and authors, as I consider them to be part of the western cannon. When we read these books, we were meant to not just improve our reading comprehension, but to also learn about cultures and experiences outside our own. That, however, does not mean that a book (and, I suppose, though wholly unnecessary, a film) like Little Women is not valid and should not be written/produced/seen/considered. It should.

It has more to do with the whole mythology which has grown up around this story since it was first published in 1868-69 and subsequently embraced by so many generations of (mostly white) girls.  Especially the whole thing about \"which March sister are you?\" because \"Every girl, it is decided, must be in some part a Jo, a Meg, a Beth or an Amy.\"  It seems to me that Ms. Greenidge is gently reminding us that there are a whole lot of other possibilities beyond those four, supposedly universal, types of girls.\n\nBeyond that, I wholeheartedly agree with all the comments here saying that literature is an engine for empathy.  Thank God for the Toni Morrisons and James Baldwins and Zora Neale Hurstons and Richard Wrights who have done so much to expand the American literary canon.

I almost didn't take my daughters to see this, despite my younger one wanting to, because of the backlash.  However, what prompted me to do it was remembering how big a part the book plays in the book \"My Brilliant Friend.\"  In that book, two small girls in a pretty bleak city in Italy where most girls aren't schooled beyond age 10 because it's viewed as a waste, are so thrilled to find a book written by a woman about women that it drives them forward to seek out an education.  While \"My Brilliant Friend\" was a work of fiction, I do imagine \"Little Women\" encouraged many girls to keep reading, to keep learning, to keep striving.",

I read everything she wrote including her \"thrillers\", Transcendental Wild Oats, etc. and including her father's Journal and her mothers entries in that journal. Why? Because I saw similarities between her experiences as part of a small radical culture and my own. Her perspective gave me a way to see the humor in the extremist and idealist vision of my parents and their circle of friends during the \"red scare\". For me it was scary growing up with so much hostility from the mainstream culture but Louisa May Alcott showed me how to validate my experience and see into how that culture shaped the people who were part of it including myself.

Authors usually write books because they want to earn a living and they therefore write what sells.  Hollywood makes movies that they think will bring in more revenues than they cost to make.  Until recently, white people were the majority in this country, and certainly that was the case when Little Women was written, so no surprise it focuses on the white point of view.  To expect otherwise is illogical.  But times are changing, and as long as non whites keep buying movie tickets and streaming non-white themed content, studios will start to cater to those tastes.  Tyler Perry is an admirable example of someone who has found a very profitable niche doing just that.  But to look at Hollywood or literature as anything other than a money making enterprise is probably giving it too much credit.  when blacks drive book sales, you will see a lot of books about black people.  To look for or hope for otherwise is just inventing something that isn't there.  And I'm saddened that a black intellectual feels she has to write an essay on how she actually felt OK going to a movie about white people.  Great stories are great stories regardless of who portrays the characters.  A black guy played Hamilton to rave reviews, right?",

ALL women for centuries, or millennia, have had to find ways to identify with, or find relationship to, a fictional universe created mostly by men, especially in elite written literature to which they were denied access. That includes nonwhite cultures. The women's response, which I encourage the article writer and all the other disgruntled, to imitate is that they created their own fiction, often being the ones who constructed and modified the oral folktales which are the world's richest source of literature. And when they achieved power to do so, like Alcott, they created their own rather than complaining about what existed. While we're at it, that goes for people who bash the likes of Kipling, who, with all his faults, created worlds that were NOT simply imperialist (the character Kim is not English but Irish-Indian; Mowgli is not a white boy; Kipling himself was extremely critical of British institutions, which victimized him plenty when he was a child). Where are the novels by those in former colonies attempting sensitively to explore the good as well as the bad in both their own and others' culture, as writers like Conrad and Kipling did, with irony directed at both?

Is empathy really empathy if it\u2019s generally asked to flow in only one direction?\" That's exactly why I find most movies, or novels, impossible to watch, since they tend to reflect the \"one direction\" of male characters and reduce girls and women to \"props\" or erotic objects. A rare few women authors (Alcott, Austen, the Brontes, et al) have given women readers & filmgoers the narrative sustenance they have craved over the years. As Austen wrote, \"Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. .. the pen has been in their hands.\" Yet not long ago a highschool teacher I know apologized to parents of boys in her class for assigning \"Pride & Prejudice\"--to the entire class of girls and boys. No such apology on behalf of the girls for the rest of the reading list, all male authors. Again, beautifully written, Kaitlyn Greenidge. Thank you.",

That semester, I found myself becoming jealous -- really jealous -- of Black women's sense of community, their shared history and consequent knowledge, the strength and belonging of the professor, the characters, the authors who created those characters.  They shared something that I didn't; in some ways, my family, my community, my identity were so broken down in comparison.  I wanted something of that -- Black womanhood -- for myself, so much.  I couldn't have it; I could only watch and observe and try to understand.\n\nIt was a strange experience, that wanting, the likes of which I haven't felt again, even though I now live in a country with which I share no history or heritage, and barely speak the language, and am clearly a foreigner.

I think the first version of the film with Kathryn Hepburn the best and wished they had stopped there. The obsession of repeatedly producing the same story stopped being  fun a long time ago. Enough already! Can screen writers, producers, etc. who conceive of ideas for movies not come up with something different instead of rehashing the same story and beating it to death? There are so many novels, stories and concepts  about the same issues dealt with by Louisa May Alcott in her books that are never brought to the fore. Those books might just be as compelling as another redo of \"Little Women\". Alcott did not deal with race. She did deal with the price of war, it's impact on a family and growing up amidst the confusion and turmoil of war in a town distant from the actual fighting. There are other books that could be the basis for exploration. I cannot watch another rendition of \"Little Women\" no matter who stars in it. It would feel like a rag sent through the wash until it just falls apart. That alone does injustice to Ms. Alcott's book. With all the great books out there can some one not write a screen play for something different?",

The abolition of slavery and the women's right to vote sometimes have been arrayed against one another in a zero sum game played by white men.  I think Little Women is more concerned with the realization of women's rights.  There is some homage paid to the importance of the abolition movement, well, Mr. March even served in the Union Army, putting his life on the line to defeat slavery, leaving his wife and daughters home alone to fend for themselves.   That was a significant act of sacrifice on the part of the entire March family.",

Usually derived from personal experience or indirectly from another's experience.   These are intensely personal viewpoints and to the extent they can be shared successfully with diverse audiences, the more universal.  To the extent that only tribal audiences resonate with the novel, the less so.  Tim O'Brien resonates with me for reasons that a young woman will never understand fully.\n\nMovies are commercial projects underwritten for one purpose only: to make money for those who fund the projects.  That's it.  Whether its \"Do the Right Thing\" or \"Little Women,\" the financial backers primary purpose was to make money.  That way they can make more movies.  Such is entertainment.\n\nThe most important issue in my mind is the reference to Ellen Garrison and her omission from any histories I have read of the period.  It rankles that courageous people who worked to right wrongs in the face of evil ignorance are ignored in the history lessons in our schools.  Texas schoolbooks describing slaves as field workers writ large.\n\nFix education.  Let the movies take care of themselves.",

But, if I may, I have to point out that not every little white girl talked about which one of those characters they were like. For many of us, this book was no fuel for inspiration.

The best-told stories will give children those points of deep connection no matter where the character was born or how they look: in a way it is all about the choices they make to overcome the challenges they are presented with and the humanity they grow into. \nAnd yes it also matters so much that there are characters who represent and validate the experiences of all different kinds of children: children of all colors, shapes, sizes, abilities, economic status, oppressed or privileged, beautiful by the standards of the day, or not. Or refreshingly portrayed as real, rough, dirty, wild, scrappy, full of dreams and anger, love and longing.

On her merits I believe she deserves the consideration. On the facts of all other considerations I don't think she, or anyone else, deserves  consideration for our recognition. J-Lo is one of the least appreciated hard working actors, dancers, singers, talents in the country. Well deserving of any and all awards the country has chosen to give. But the failure of the award giving 'big-wigs' to acknowledge her talent shouldn't get mixed up in racism, politics, prejudices of any kind, especially when they are probably present. The failure is the Judges, not the wonderful actress, dancer, singer, talent that she is. So don't say she \"deserves\" something and isn't getting it because of her race, gender, or irrelevant factors. Especially because you have a favorite cause you think  can be advanced because the Judges judged incorrectly and foolishly. Prejudice exists and needs  exposed. But stupidity , smallness of character, judgmental failings, also exist. The Oscar judges were far more stupid than prejudiced. And the author here may be looking to protect his personal causes far more than he is willing to say J-Lo, on the merits, was very worthy of consideration and the Judges were simply stupid, small, unworthy judges.",

Whether we like the movie or not lets talk her outstanding acting job. Her role playing a woman who is willing to take back power. Willing to put herself on the line, take risks, do what it takes to do the unthinkable.  A strong woman in a strong role. Carlos Aguilar is spot on in pointing out that American Latin is clustered w being Latin.  There is a distinction between being American and being born here in the USA, yes, having a Latin heritage but none the less American with same views and philosophies.  She has acted across some of the most accomplished actors in this country and been able to hold her own.  She was snubbed and she deserved better Latin or not.  She is a perfectionist who deserved to be recognized.  Golden Globes, yes the winner Laura Dern took home her \"FIFTH\" 5th Golden Globe, I would say she has been previously recognized lets give someone new a chance whose work was equally good if not better.  Jennifer has upward 40 movies and no awards - I would say that\u2019s a big SNUB. Why? Because it is not for lack of good acting. Jlo keep doing what you do b/c we love you!

J.Lo as a victim of industry prejudice is just laughable, all the way to the bank! Worse still is the trendy politically correct diction, which makes even a thoughtful commentary sound silly. Latinx? Romance languages assert gender much more than does English, in almost all nouns and adjectives, for example. Neutering \u201cLatin\u201d by adding an x to the word, which is by itself gender-neutral, inadvertently satirizes the use language rather than making it more socially accommodating. As a substitute in Spanish for Latino or Latina, the permutation is yet more preposterous, since every other noun and adjective would have to be truncated, too. Absurd!",

Yes, great performances by hustlers, by strippers should be recognized (they have!) but the immense brave performance by Aisling Franciosi in Nightingale to have not been recognized is truly shameful. The Kent or Franciosi exclusions seems to bother none of the critics in our Northern hemisphere.",

Much like movie critics who render neutral judgements, the academy members rendered their critical opinion and decided J-Lo wasn't nomination worthy. \n\nWhat's needed are more opportunities for actors/actress of color in a wider variety of roles. For instance, color-blind casting in roles that aren't race specific. While it'd be silly for a white actor to play a historical figure like MLK, it would've been cutting edge to cast a Latino or African-American as Bilbo (no one said Hobbits need to be white. Think Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury). \n\nThere also need to be greater opportunities for people of color as directors, producers, writers, etc. This would expand the pool of potential nominees. It also applies to white women, who're nearly as underrepresented in Hollywood in non-acting jobs. Such opportunities as directors, for ex., would yield a larger pool of potential nominees.   \n\nSadly, it's going to be difficult to overcome barriers of institutionalized racism/gender discrimination.

Similar response from young Black actors, who've recently graduated from Juilliard and Yale.  The impression I've received is Hispanics want what they want, but they're unwilling to sit down and do the work to get their stories on the screen, the way Blacks do. It's much easier to whine and complain.  When it comes to the Oscars, actors nominate actors and I think a lot of actors view Ms. Lopez as a celebrity who views acting as a hobby.

Sheesh!\n\nWhen Jimmy Stewart won for his totally ordinary performance in \"The Philadelphia Story\", Henry Fonda lost for his greatest performance, ever as Tom Joad in \"Grapes of Wrath\".\n\nCitizen Kane, A Clockwork Orange,  and Raging Bull, all movies for the ages, all, ALL lost to forgotten and now dated flicks, How Green was My Valley, French Connection, and Ordinary People.\n\nIn the Heat of the Night was a good film, but Bonnie & Clyde and the Graduate are still watched today, and timeless.\n\nIn fact, if you look down the best picture list for the last 50 years, at least half the time forgettable pictures won over classics.  Forgettable, pedestrian performances won over virtuoso tour de forces.\n\nNot all the time, but too much of the time.  That's why I NEVER watch or pay attention to the Oscars, because they don't tell me if I will enjoy or hate a movie. \n\nThey are not a measure of quality, but simply an advertising gimmick, where money and influence are spent to get  votes, rather than a demonstration of quality.",

I would say to the author: what in the world led you to believe that there's an ethnic quota for Academy Awards?\nDuring my 30-year career as a journalist, I was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize twice only to be denied.

We beautifully relected America.\nAs for Lopez, I am fairly certain the judges did not conclude that they ought to deny a deserving Latina an Oscar based on her race.\nOne last comment:  Enough with the Latinx nonsense already.  I don't know a single Latino who uses the term.  In fact most of us Latinos prefer to identify with a specific nationality.  \nThe word Latinx sounds like a disease or some new pharmaceutical product.",

There was a time, not long ago when the Black actors only were auditioned for the maid, cook or janitor. Sidney Portier's doctor in Guess Whose Coming to Dinner was the other extreme.\n\nPeople of color were either at the very bottom of society, or the very top, nothing in between. Meanwhile, white actors are perceived as representing the full spectrum of our human experience, even the experience of non-whites.\n\nI once thought this was an issue of exclusion. But I've now come to the conclusion that this is simply a lack of creativity and imagination, which is supposed to be the very core of the film industry. \n\nHollywood doesn't know how to imagine us. But Black and Latino directors, writers and actors do. America doesn't know the people around them because they have spent so much energy not knowing them.\n\nHollywood needs to open the up at the script writing, directing and producing level. When it does, the Oscars for people of color will come. \n\nBut to do so Hollywood has to recognize its own very peculiar brand of racism. It's done so with homophobia. Now it's time to do so with Latinos and African Americans. \n\nWe also have a universal message to share. And yes, there is enough money to go around for everyone",

The point is not to check off a diversity box but instead to recognize truly great performances. So, when a person who is not Caucasian gives a great performance, is in a profitable film, and does their due diligence in terms of campaigning (which should be a less important requirement), they deserve a nomination. However, each year at these major awards, we are represented with a slate of films that elevate specific and predominantly Caucasian stories, even if they are lackluster in terms of their quality. It is an incessant pattern. Bombshell's nominations and its actual storytelling quality, Scarlett Johanssen's two nominations in two different categories, Joker having the most amount of nominations despite the reception are examples from this year but there could be a host of other examples that could be presented from the decades. Finally, a new story is told about a misrepresented group of American women lead by a Latina and yet the Academy continues to point their interest towards films about old Hollywood, morally questionable Fox newswomen painted as blatant heroes, and a semi-sympathetic portrait to a brutal murderer.",

This issue of representation in the industry became clear to me when watching a majority African-American cast on the HBO series Oz.   There was so much good acting, but there were many in the cast that I'd not had the opportunity to earlier experience their acting.   The solution path requires thought, but where a role doesn't *require* a specific ethnicity (or gender), casting should be color-blind, so-to-speak; that is, where the role is not about or centered on an ethnicity it should be open to cast anyone with the right skills.   By both laziness and necessity to tell an important story, however, many roles and movies do center around ethnicity.   There's accumulating evidence that audiences of all backgrounds can relate to and appreciate performances by minority actors.",

I know the reality usually falls short, but you didn't even claim in your article that she gave a great performance -- just that it was better than anything else she's done and that it's been a long time since her first movie.\n\nI support your goal of more and better representation -- for all marginalized groups.

This will involve a great deal of introspection and even then, it\u2019s an extremely difficult. One doesn\u2019t usually have proper insight into ones own emotional makeup. Most of us spend our time trying to rationalize our behavior as a result of our lack of self awareness. Maybe it\u2019s wrong of me to share my rebellious views since I live in a state of dissatisfaction with language. At times I feel alienated, cut off from others and myself within language. While the contented are untroubled, at times distracted by words like Latinx and most people are inclined to think that way. Using language is an integral part of the human condition. We live within language, yet our way of life is something we find hard to see.",

Who has the wherewithall, ambition, and smarts to produce their very first music concert and have it filmed for television?  Jennifer Lopez.  In one bold move she established herself as one to be reckoned with.\n\nOrson Welles, Cary Grant, Lauren Bacall, and Judy Garland never won Oscars (though ironically Renee Zellweger is nominated for portraying Judy).  Time will tell if Jennifer Lopez joins the ranks of those accomplished non-winners, but she is definitely way beyond fulfilling expectations of those who knew early on she'd accomplish big things.  Music is just one facet of her multi-talented career. \n\nShe's an inspiration for us all -- of every color -- and she's not even close to being done yet.",

There is a lot of smoke and mirrors to J.Lo's performance that \"civilians\" might not see, tricks of editing, camera angles, etc.. It is a very posed performance: she makes a lot of fierce entrances and exits, wind machines gusting her very coiffed hair, which might be impressive, but they don't constitute good acting. That early scene on the rooftop with her fur coat might as well be a fashion shoot.\n\nWhat about the fact J.Lo never utters a word of Spanish the whole film, not even to the nanny? How is she representing Latinx with that? And she definitely had the power to make that happen, especially as the film's main producer.\n\nAbove all, these cries of racism and discrimination whenever a PoC doesn't get what her socio-cultural group thinks she deserves need to stop.

I think a case can be made that Jennifer Lopez movie (Hustler) was better than Katy Bates movie (Richard Jewell) in both Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, and certainly Jennifer Lopez performance was better than Katy's (personal opinion that matches most critics).  I think the nominees should have been Scarlett, Laura, Margot, Florence and Lopez. I think she was robbed, and being Latina contributed a little to that fact (I also think that she does not deserve to win, as at least 2 or 3 performances there were better). Also, some of those criticizing JLo might argue that a woman should have been nominated as a Director for the Oscars. Can you be bold enough to tell me who of the directors should be replaced by what woman in the nomination process?

Simply pass out the awards based upon national racial, gender, and religious demographics and call it a day.  The only problem I suspect will be that no one will watch.  People want to see excellence regardless of who performs it.  Does that mean we always reward the best performances, or performers regardless of identity?  Of course not, that will never be possible. One thing is for sure, there will always be differences of opinion, and when it comes to art, that's good, as not all of us, value all performances/art the same, nor should we. When it comes to identity politics, and fiction we have to remember that we are watching something that is usually totally made up.  If you want actual role models, look around you, or create documentaries, there are some excellent audio ones, about real people, overcoming real obstacles.  They stumble and fall, but get back up.  Those people are inspirational, regardless of their background, and some even more impressive because of it.  Let's have an award show for them. Let's keep our symbols real.  Overpaid pop/movie stars, regardless of heritage, are not true heros, but people who are given enormous economic privilege and undue influence because they do a few things very well, or just happen to look good.",

However, it sounds terrible in the language of Cervantes and I do not wish to be called like that.\n\nThe article is careful in some places to call latinx only people from the US, but then groups them with Latin Americans like Cuaron and I\u00f1arritu. \n\nOn any case, think that this horrible label - cacophonous- is imposed to the rest of us, Spanish speakers, not from the US.

The idea that an American institution, based in Los Angeles, can somehow be the arbiters of cinema was and is simply hubris and, any attack for lack of inclusion in their annual party simply reinforces the groundless idea that the list of nominations reflects borderless excellence. More fundamentally, the power of art lies in the specifics of history, culture, community, and identity--it's probably unrealistic and ham-handed to expect the voters who live in the white suburbs of Los Angeles, New York, and London to fully appreciate the works set in Seoul, or Istanbul, or even ethnic communities of Queens, NY or East LA. Once we fully acknowledge that the most important job of filmmakers at Burbank and  Dagenham is to appeal to residents of Orange County (CA), Connecticut, and Nottinghill, we might lose some of the passion to see yellow, brown, and black faces on the screen so much. If it happens at all, it's a pleasant surprise.",

Ms. Lopez's performance in HUSTLERS may have been the sixth or seventh best in 2019 as judged by the voters, but in another year it might have been considered the third, second or top performance of the year. \n\nIs anyone aware that in a career of nearly a half-century on the screen, and having given some of the most amazing, iconic, and just plain memorable performances ever seen on the screen, the great Edward G. Robinson was never even nominated for an Academy Award? Did he complain about it? Not that I know of. Nobody ascribed this to any kind of prejudice against immigrants or Jews (he was both), and other Jews and/or Jewish immigrants were not only nominated but winning AAs (just up to 1950, think Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Paul Lukas and Judy Holliday for starters). It was simply the luck of the annual draw, and everybody understood it before diversity became more of a product than an aim.\n\nThis is the kind of article that reflects no credit on the writer, the paper that prints it, the actors it mentions, or the movie industry in general, as it seems to come down on the side of giving nominations (and, consequently, the actual awards?) based on something other than just being deserved - on the actors' race, ethnicity, etc.",

Of course maybe Oscar voters are hyper aware of her Latinx background and have decided that disqualifies her, but I'll bet I am more rather than less typical of how people see JLo. \n\nGiven her immense powerhouse popularity and wealth Carlos Aguilar rather sounds like Trump complaining he is not getting all the attention. I don't know if Hollywood is vitally aware of Lopez being Latina and how much that factors in, but Hollywood has often glossed over the \"pop stars\" in favor of a \"serious\" actors. It's a small number that have been even nominated. \n\nIt is interesting that Aguilar complains about the lack of mainstream roles for Latinx actors but then dismissively calls out the ones that Lopez got (and yes, I loved them all) as \"coded as white\".",

Nor has JLo been robbed simply because she hasn't been given a nomination, much less an Oscar to place on the fireplace mantel of  her well-appointed Bel-Air mansion. It concerns me that so many don't seem to understand that concerns about who gets the nomination and who gets the award are the least important and most superficial questions to be asked, much less the concerns about the award fulfillment of a single film star.",

As much as we need Medicare for those who are not covered by any health care, we also need to fund it properly, which we are not doing.  Medicare Part A will be underwater in 2026.  That's right all the banked savings will be gone.  So, this requires a tax increase even if we do not add another 30M onto Medicare rolls.  You also need to take into account that Medicare underpays for services, sometimes by as much as 70%.  This is why many smalltown hospitals and medical centers are going broke, and shutting down.  The problem is not just to add Medicare or not, the problem is the cost.  We have too few doctors at too high a cost, who carry too much debt.  We also have too many Americans who don't listen to their doctors, even when they can afford them.  Obesity is one such epidemic which is not caused by lack of doctor care or high prescription drug costs.  It's caused by inattention and often poor food choices. Food is also medicine. Medical care is as complex as the variations in human bodies.  To try and simplify it all down to a point for political expediency entirely misses the most basic point about human health.  It requires constant care. Cuba provides great care for very little money.  They take time with elders.  If you want a model of how to not only make many more eligible for Medicare, but also make it sustainable, there's a great place to start.  The US can learn much from other countries.",

Being healthy is not something the free market has much, if any influence on.  In fact the free market makes people sick by selling harmful food and other products and by poisoning the environment.\n\nMr. Bouie is absolutely correct in that conservatives always oppose programs that help lower income people with the reasoning that we can't afford more welfare. Conservatives tend to buy that argument because they do not want the assistance to go to certain kinds of people.  Corporate bailouts, farm bailouts, private prisons, defense contractors, all no problem.  There is always money for them.  But daycare for a woman in Detroit so she can hold down a job, no way.  Public transit so an inner city dweller can get to a job, no way.  Expand medicare, well we just don't have the money for that. \n\nSocial infrastructure, like Medicaid, builds communities.  Conservatives are more interested in building millionaires.  They still push trickle down economics which is really just a ruse to establish a wealth aristocracy.  They have succeeded.",

His message is clear but not the one I was hoping for. \n\nMany progressive policies are pragmatic because, in the long term, they are good for the economy.  The average American should be easy to convince that spending twice as much as our competing nations for health care is a huge disadvantage towards keeping our exports, particularly the exports that create jobs, competitive. \n\nPost WWII the U.S. provided free college education too any veteran that wanted it, which turned out to be a huge boon to our economy.  Loan based financing is a burden to graduates whose creative entrepreneurial dreams have to be postponed to pursue sure salaries with companies already running.\n\nIn the '40's a high school diploma was the equivalent of a college degree today and none but radical libertarians argue that high school shouldn't be free.\n\nAllowing the accumulation of money in fewer and fewer hands is another obvious abuse of human capital.  That wealth better distributed could lead to a much more creative  version of capitalism, increasing our true economic strength.   \n\nAnd then there is the issue about sustaining a planet inhabitable for our species.  The GOP position on this and especially Trump's is so utterly reckless it is the opposite of pragmatism.\n\nThe only true fiscal conservative and pragmatic policies are being pursued by liberals.  The GOP is into strip mining for short-term profits to the few.",

Protecting the people, other than with a defense establishment, isn\u2019t one of them.  Sure, there\u2019s always that desire to escape from all that anxiety-provoking freedom.  But the longing for the state to relieve that anxiety has given us Trump.  That sure ain\u2019t woke and big state solutions ain\u2019t usually pragmatism.",

Their focus on how Bernie would negotiate with Mitch McConnell also misses the point -- his whole campaign is predicated on the notion that our way of doing politics and governance is irretrievably broken, and that meeting our challenges will require forming a real movement through mobilization of people on the streets, at their workplaces and in communities.\u00a0 \n\nThat the Times is rolling out its endorsement with the fanfare of the Oscar nominations, when newspaper endorsements have never meant less, suggests just how antiquated its worldview has become.",

Medicaid expansion was brilliant because it maximized winners while addressing concerns of stakeholders who might have been losers.  \n\nGetting on a glide path to universal coverage (be it M4A or other form of universal coverage) requires addressing the concerns of enough stakeholders that resistance to change can be overcome in the legislative process.  If the Democrats had a super majority in both houses, it might be possible to pass single payer and tough out effects of the change on disadvantaged stakeholders.

People like to get things they didn't have before, but they don't like change from things they have to things which are only promised to be better.  Opposition to replacing the current employer-mediated plans with single-payer is rational, because people are well aware that politicians usually do not fully deliver what they promise in campaigns.  They want to be able to chose in real time between types of insurance.  Thus Democrats who want to improve health care must promise three things; a) a choice between the new insurance and employer-mediated insurance; and b) lower expenditure for the new insurance; c) no new limitation on care.  These things are in detail much more complicated than just saying we will have single-payer, but a successful candidate should have plausible plans.

The rationale was a makeweight--a means for Roberts to throw a bone to conservatives otherwise outraged that he did not provide the fifth vote required to hold the entire ACA unconstitutional. Consider the implications of the Medicaid holding's logic: The federal government could almost never choose to discontinue a major program. To my knowledge, this rationale has never been employed in other context. The ruling is yet another example of the results-driven jurisprudence of the right wing of the Roberts Court.",

So it's not only proponents of Medicare for All who may be deploying this progressive pragmatism but also the more centrist liberal-left of the party that wants to build on and expand Obamacare. \n\nPerhaps the lesson of Medicaid expansion is not only that new programs create new constituencies but also that incremental change can have snowball effects. (And I very much agree with another commenter that the grass roots activism/ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid in Idaho and other states deserved mention.) \n\nA public option would build a constituency too.

Many lower income people do not consult lawyers, and spouses can end up having to pay \"estate recovery\" (payback) to the government for any nursing home cost that was used when the property is sold at a later date.

Ultimately the states make the recovery laws, but it would help if the federal government can instill some across the board laws because many lower income people have lower income heirs.

Mr. Bouie skirts around that obstacle by focusing on the policy effects and electoral impact, but still is thinking like a pundit. \n\nIf you can feel the burden of starting a working life with decades of crushing student debt, then you can see why fully funding higher education benefits all. If you can put yourself in the role of a single parent, struggling on one, inadequate income without any help for daycare, transportation, or medical bills, then you may see how life is stacked in favor of those who can afford those necessities. If you can put yourself in the mind of a family that is one emergency room trip away from bankruptcy, then you may see the wisdom of universal health care. \n\nPundits need to emphasize that not only are programs like Medicaid helpful directly, they help avoid the consequences that befall those on the edge of personal crisis. For the too many people already fallen through the shreds of the social safety net, we must add the exponential costs of helping them repair their lives. \n\nNo single election will redress the wrongs in our society, but Mr. Bouie is correct that the success of the repairs to the safety net will begin to rebuild its strength. Yet we must do better than repairs.",

In Utah, the Republican state legislator called an emergency session to amend the law placing limits on the expansion. This effort largely failed. The Center Medicare and Medicaid services is poised to reject the amendment and force the adoption of full Medicaid expansion. The possible exception is a work requirement.\n\nEven in a state that is two-thirds Republican and 80 percent Republican controlled due to gerrymandering, a majority of citizens can agree more people, particularly families, deserve health care. Kansas and Kentucky have no such option because citizens are not allowed to introduce ballot initiatives. Kentucky can do us all a favor though by sending Mitch McConnell into retirement.\n\nPoint being: Socialized medicine is a bipartisan winner. Try using private insurance in times of stress and anxiety. It's like playing minesweeper with a broom stick. The Republican political apparatus is preventing citizens from obtaining something they want. Ballot initiatives make this point abundantly clear. Time to make that point before the public. Bernie Sanders definitely gave the conversation a push.\n\nAnd while Medicaid expansion is great, we need to recognize the effort is a drop in the bucket. $35,000 income for a family of FOUR receives health care after expansion. That's an improvement. We can do better.",

If Facebook\u2019s 2 billion users are dumb enough to believe everything they read on the internet in general, and Facebook in particular, you can\u2019t fix that.  If they\u2019re dumb enough to surround themselves with like-minded people, and listen to whatever they post as if it were gospel, you can\u2019t fix that.  If they then pass on whatever drivel they read, thus giving it the whiff of fact, you can\u2019t fix that.  In short, Facebook gives everybody a megaphone, and that includes some people who shouldn\u2019t be entrusted with one.  And if you disagree, imagine the howl if Facebook started censoring or otherwise curtailing false speech, be it a paid political ad or an uninformed opinion from Uncle Bob.",

Businesses sell products. It is why they can exist. Facebook sells ads and gleans information to sell further ads based on their users' choices. If we want to control the outcomes of using Facebook, we could stop trying to make Facebook Big Brother, and take control of our own minds. Individuals are responsible for that control, and only individuals can implement that control. We encounter lies and truth every day in all settings, not just media companies (and Facebook has become, due to the law of unintended consequences, a media company). What are we going to do as individuals to understand our own minds well enough to discern truth from fiction, especially since all of us are governed by implicit and explicit biases of various kinds? IMHO this is our entrance exam to the next phase of human evolution. If we pass, we will have greater freedom and opportunity because we are no longer controlled by artifacts of mind we should control ourselves. If we fail, we will likely experience a significant implosion of world civilization.

Even courts accepting this defense as an adequate safeguard have recognized the difficulties of adducing legal proofs that the alleged libel was true in all its factual particulars. Under such a rule, would-be critics of official conduct may be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be true and even though it is, in fact, true, because of doubt whether it can be proved in court or fear of the expense of having to do so. They tend to make only statements which \"steer far wider of the unlawful zone.\" The rule thus dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate.",

TV networks and operators are not allowed -- prohibited, by the government and law - from even trying to determine whether or not political advertising is \"truthful\" or not. \n\nRight? There are laws about deceptive marketing and truth in advertising. But political ads are exempt -- by law -- because they are, well, political. And filtering or banning or editorializing about political speech is in direct conflict with the 1st amendment and our basic ideas about liberty (the King of England loved to have the ability to suppress political speech.)\n\nMs. swisher and so many in Silicon valley have a noticable hatred for Facebook. Why? Maybe because the whole ecosystem is so immoral, or at least amoral, that they are ashamed, but can't bring themselves to go after their beloved heroes (Apple, Google, Twitter, whatever) so Facebook is the acceptable scapegoat. All media companies that sell ads, sell micro targeted ads. All.",

The volume of ads alone would require hiring thousands of fact checkers. Then there would be the headline grabbing rancor over what\u2019s fact and what isn\u2019t. It would launch a thousand conspiracy theories. People like to point out that mainstream media police ads. True, but the scale is so much smaller and manageable. FB has an estimated 2 billion users.

But I haven't yet seen an answer to the problem of political propaganda. At least one that could pass constitutional muster. \n\nFox News runs purposefully false political advertisements every evening. They just call it their nightly program lineup. And if you miss the propaganda, they helpfully hit the highlights every morning on Fox and Friends. Their top on air propagandists even advise the President from time to time, presumably to help him fine tune his lies. \n\nFox of course is not the only one. There is talk radio and too numerous to count websites spewing lies.\n\nSo what do we do? Bring back the Fairness Doctrine? I believe the Supreme Court ruled it constitutional only because of the limited spectrum available to TV at the time. With a zillion channels and websites (many not based in the U.S.) how is that supposed to work?  Can you imagine Trump Jr. as the FCC Fairness Czar reviewing MSNBC and NYT streaming media?\n\nI applaud keeping pressure on Facebook to do MUCH better and we shouldn't let perfect be the enemy of the good. \n\nBut I see little hope in the big picture.

In order to facilitate this, highly personalised and targeted variants of messages should be banned. Otherwise tracking becomes unmanageable.\n\nThe corrupting epidemic of falsehood amplified by new medias needs to be treated very seriously, it has become one of the biggest threats to democracy in recent history. We see instances of that with a US president who gets away with hundreds if not thousands of untruthful statements. He lies in the face of the nation every single day, in total impunity. The same problem is visible in some mainstream news outlet (e.g. Fox News, Murdoch's systematic denial of climate change in Australia, ...) where deliberate bias and lies influence public opinions and policies.\n\nControlling the accuracy of public messages is obviously a very demanding, delicate and tricky task.

I saw them in 1983 for the first and only time, but remained a fan. One of my high school yearbook quotes was from 2112. After watching the R40 tour DVD, I became hopeful that they would tour again someday so I could see The Professor one more time. I\u2019m now full of regret because that will never happen. I went numb when I heard of Neil\u2019s passing. So many thoughts raced through my head about my life and how Rush has been there through the good and bad times. I\u2019ve been watching tributes, interviews, videos, and listening to the band almost non-stop since Friday. I\u2019m still trying to process Neil\u2019s death and the shock that I feel knowing that a major part of my life has been taken away forever. It\u2019s made me realize not only my own mortality, but that we can\u2019t take the people and things we love in life for granted. R.I.P. Neil. Thank you for your contributions to my life and the world.",

            "comment_body": "Rush was unique, not only in each member's virtuoso musical skills, but also in the lyrics of their songs that went beyond rock's standard fare of sex, drugs and rock n' roll.  Most of Rush's songs were cerebral touching on, science, lit., history, ect. Neil Peart was the primary lyricist for the band and drew upon a deep well of knowledge gained by many years of wide and varied reading.  There is a reason why Getty and Alex dubbed him the Professor.  Peart often celebrated the individual, those who were willing to think for themselves even at the expense of being an outcast.  One of my favorite lines in this vein is from Tom Sawyer where Getty's high voice loudly proclaims, \"His mind is not for rent to any God or government.\"\nSeeing Rush in concert, one had to marvel at their sheer talent.  One of the highlights was always Peart's drum solo.  At some point in the concert, Neil would launch into his virtuoso act, which usually lasted nearly 10 minutes.  In the middle of the solo, he would stand up, his massive drum kit would rotate 180 degrees and be replaced by a completely different drum kit.  Once the new kit was in place, Peart would sit down and, without missing a beat, continue his solo.  It was truly amazing.  Mr. Peart, rest in peace.  The world was a better place with you in it, and I only hope that you had some realization of how many lives Rush's music has truly touched.",

One of those friends told me if I wanted to really feel the bass, I should listen to this band he loved called \u201cRush.\u201d  Those friends and I went to at least one or two shows together in every tour from Presto through the final tour in 2015 despite our increasingly longer distances apart.  I have been listening to Rush\u2019s albums over and over the past three days - and I feel as if a part of me died with Neil.  But more than that, I also feel the life that infuses the lyrics and the music - and that is something that will remain once my grief has run its course.  I still can\u2019t quite accept I will never see Rush in concert again with those friends - I had held out hope despite news of Neil\u2019s \u201cretirement.\u201d  But those concerts, and my learning to play music through learning to love Rush, will be among the best memories I carry throughout the rest of my life.

Finding a fellow Rush fan was difficult, finding a fellow female Rush fan was damn near impossible.  I love many types of music but Rush has always been my favorite bc I love them on so many levels. I literally and figuratively grew up with and because of them. When I went through my hard rock stage there was Working Man, when sci-fi wass the only thing I was interested in there was 2112, Anthem was there for my dystopian phase. Freewill gave me confidence during high school. Just being a Rush fan taught me that different is good. I geeked out over the fact that 2112 is my favorite album and it came out the year I was born and the fact that I have the same birthday as Alex. I've probably seen them close to 10 times and every time Neil played his solo, I would close my eyes so that I could concentrate on the sheer genius and mastery. I loved that his solo evolved over time and that it reflected so many sides of him. The last few shows, I held onto to those moments even harder because I knew eventually there would be no more. Reading about other people's experiences with Rush has been gratifying, knowing others drew validation and joy from Rush's artistry. Each member member is phenomenal in their craft but the sum of the parts is most definitely greater. Thank you everyone for sharing your thoughts.",

Neil's  literacy, as much as his ferocious skills behind the kit, were the pulse of the band.  \n\nOn stage, they were much like Pink Floyd in that they clearly plowed earnings into making their shows as sonically perfect for the listener as they did in album engineering and production values.  If you saw them live you also heard them clearly. \n\nNeil, if Heaven exists, I hope I can sit in with you someday.  I can keep up with Geddy through \"Hemispheres\".  Maybe by then I'll have \"YYZ\" down. :)",

I learned their entire catalog through Grace Under Pressure on guitar, and every song on air drums.  The air drums were more difficult to play! I wrote my college application essay on Neil Peart, about how I admired his integrity and intellect under the glare of the spotlight.\n\nAs I aged through college, early adulthood, and middle age, my lust for hard rock and instrumental virtuosity waned, as jazz became the bulk of my listening, and Neil's rigid perfection was replaced in my musical brain by a preference for improvisation.\n\nBut as I got older, something else happened. The desire for meaning, for art that was reflective, for something that could capture my increasingly jaded imagination - became more important than ever before.  Neil Peart's lyrics have always given me that, and still do.\n\nWhile he inspired a generation of drummers, it Neil's body of lyrical poetry that will be his true legacy.  His ideas on so many topics - both real and fantasy - will continue to capture the soul of listeners for generations to come.  I need not look any further than my 15 year old daughter, whose own existential turmoil has been relieved by the lyrics to Analog Kid and Subdivisions.  She may not memorize the drum fills, but she's already singing along.\n\nGoodbye Professor.  Your place in the history of music, and in our hearts, is assured.",

I loved how they looked, what they sang about, and the idea that one could be both cool and intelligent in rock music. No matter how \u201cmathy\u201d Rush got, I never thought of them as nerdy. In fact, they helped me own my own geekiness and become a rocker. I saw them 75 times over the decades, including the final tour, which I spent a small fortune to attend up close. Never heard them sound so good at The Garden. I cheered and air-drummed the entire time and shed some tears at end. \n\nThe running joke was that there were no female Rush fans, and I used to take pictures of the empty women\u2019s bathroom at shows. But we are out there, and some of us are drummers, too. Neil\u2019s playing was an endless inspiration. \n\nNeil, Geddy and Alex showed tremendous love and integrity toward each other, and the fact that they were able to keep Neil\u2019s illness quiet til the very end shows the deep respect and brotherhood that exists between them. I love them as much for that as for the music. I\u2019m deeply sad for their loss. \n\nFarewell to the King. Thank you for a lifetime of joy and musical discovery. I\u2019ll stop crying eventually.",

But alienation also figures prominently with Rand, for she wrote about the creative individuals who were not understood because they stood apart from the rest. I watched an interview of Geddy Lee last week. His parents were Holocaust survivors, but most of his family was lost to the Holocaust. After the war his parents relocated to Canada, where Lee grew up. He is exceptionally intelligent and sensitive. That Peart and Lee would combine their talents was a gift to us.",

He spoke to my struggle to understand myself and the world as a young man, and helped me make sense of it.  And the virtuosity of his playing set a musical standard which I have tried to emulate.

Neal's performance and lyric writing skills were dynamic, and as a hockey fan I loved his take on \"the hockey theme\" (on YouTube for those not familiar with the old CBC Saturday night theme)  where he was able to add his great take on a Canadian classic. \n\nI am sad that he passed away, but am hopeful the music and thoughtful lyrics will live on for generations.",

If you (only) liked simplicity or extra grease in your grooves, he was not for you. If you thought that the best musicians were (only) focused on nightly improvisation, they were not for you. If you didnt enjoy philosophical musings in your song lyrics, often lifted straight off the page of the author's heroes (sometimes akin to sampling), you probably didn't like Rush. If Neil playing (more or less) the same drum solo for thirty plus years bothered you, he was not for you.\n\nBut...if you appreciate unique artists with virtuoso chops on their instrument, instantly recognizable sound and style, utterly original works on the kit with SINGABLE drum fills, plus a renaissance intellect and creative force on the page, you probably loved the band and the man.\n\n\"Man, sometimes it takes you a long time to sound like yourself\" - Miles Davis. Great quote. Neil didn't really seem to have that problem.\n\nI can't say that I listen to them much any more but am forever grateful. Rush was my gateway from heavy metal I was deep into as a teen to a more intellectual music and songcraft. Amazing (often epic) songs with stories that posed ethical questions - and not a bodacious ta ta to be found. I found what I'd been missing. They still delivered the rock but with brains, originality and rare integrity.\n\nAnd now there are two. Sad but feeling grateful for all the singular art and spirit he shared.",

After a round of partying that night, I was driving home around midnight as snow began falling and put it in my tape deck. As snow flakes bombarded into my headlights on a lonely , tree-lined country road, the combination of Rush's electric, eclectic and explosive sound -- Peart's brilliant percussion, Lifeson's flashing guitar and Lee's piercing vocals -- sent a rush through the entirety of my body, so much so that I had to pull over and just experience the wondrous sensation.\n\nFrom that point thereafter, I came to fully appreciate the creativity and virtuosity of Rush, collected its works and attended many concerts. I'm certainly not the first to become a Rush fan while stoned, nor the first to discover the music was just as powerful while straight.",

He didn't have to do a tribute album to Buddy Rich,or study with Fredy Gruber (one of Buddy's peers). He'd already accomplished a lot and elected to Modern Drummer magazine's Hall of Fame by that time. \nMany readers have quoted Closer to the Hunt and Subdivisions among others.A song on the Moving Pictures album that I have never heard played anywhere is Witch Hunt. The lyrics are chilling and especially appropriate today. \n\"Quick to judge,quick to anger,slow to understand,ignorance and prejudice and fear walk hand in hand\"\nThe performances of from Alex and Geddy are incredible (for those of you that don't care for Geddy's vocals,give a listen anyway). But Neil's drumming on the track is a percussive and rhythmic highlight.\nRest in peace,Neil- and thank you.",

The lyrics from The Trees, Spirit of Radio, and Subdivisions truly resonated.  Be cool or be cast out.  Indeed.  What thoroughly impressed me is Rush took their craft, and mastery of it seriously, however, never took themselves too seriously.  How refreshing.  That side of them was evident at the opening of their shows with their comedic bits.  Then they would bust right into the business at hand and always looked like they were having the time of their lives.  How could a crowd not get into that?  Then, the professor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solos.  Absolute artwork.  Fast forward 35 years and had the pleasure of taking my son to the last two tours.

Later, when I gave them a fair listen, I discovered superb musicianship and extraordinary lyrics that were written by the drummer! I guess I always thought the singer wrote the lyrics... Neil was a master at his craft. His words resonate with me to this day. In Freewill he wrote that \"Each of us, a cell of unawareness, imperfect and incomplete\" in an open minded and introspective way that I've rarely heard lyrically. All too often, I think of my favorite verse in Witch Hunt; \"Quick to judge, quick to anger, slow to understand...Ignorance and prejudice, and fear walk hand in hand\"... and wonder, was he thinking about the past or the future?

And a very unique Prog Rock band embedded in a genre that was built and founded on unique.   \n\nNot as show-off intricate (allow they had that down too) or artful or as hiply obscure as King Crimson, or as lovable and hippy-dramatic as Yes, but certainly a cut above almost all other bands for musicianship and ideas.\n\nAnd one corner they owned completely; They were the working class's prog rock band.  Not just because of their song Working Man but because they, especially due to Neil's lyrics, made simple rocker kids want to aspire literarily.  And also figure out what some of those ideas Neil wrote about meant.  \n\nBut Neil made it a whole lot easier than a Dylan or a Bowie.   He was like a Ray Bradbury without the sci-fi for Rockers.  Great big ideas that are graspable and written in a very sincere fashion.\n\nIf you haven't seen it, check out Beyond The Lighted Stage.  THE Rush documentary.\n\nThey are the hippest unhip band ever and we just lost one of their pillars.   Go easy into whatever is past this life, Neil.  I think I'll put on Caress of Steel now to help you get there . . . or to help me deal with you getting there.  Not sure which.",

But I was always a heterodox Rander, so I could appreciate their Mystic Rhythms. It seemed like Neil was on a similar intellectual journey as I was, away from simple answers and into the complexities of real life.\n\nAnd the lyrics! That made all the difference to me! Where else in music, regardless of genre, would you find a song about Aristotelian metaphysics (Prime Mover)? What especially spoke to me was Neil's positive attitude to life, one that nourished and supported my striving. Some of my favourite songs were Mission, Middletown Dreams, Closer to the Heart and Time Stand Still.\n\nAlso, what I loved going to a Rush concert is that everybody in the audience knows the words.",

To see him with his mustached visage reading \u201cA confederacy of Dunces\u201d with his cigarette billowing smoke suggested that one could be intellectually curious and cool.  To listen to his drumming and lyrics while reading was otherworldly and it provided the refuge and solace that was so necessary to us adolescent musicians and young men struggling to fit in, whatever that meant.  His music was the elixir that liberated our minds and spirits, inspiring us to lose ourselves in art, literature, philosophy, sci-fi and not compromise or conform.  His lyrics conveyed the message just be yourself, and that is more than good enough. Rest In Peace Neil, and thank you.",

I was 14...An older friend of mine was to interview them for a local entertainment newspaper. There were literally just 12 people watching the band play like they were playing to 21,000 at MSG!  I was just SO knocked out at how good they were! Then to meet them afterwards while my friend interviews them was a major pivotal point in my life. I became less obsessed as I have shed, but I did buy every record and saw them many times over the years.  I felt like Neil and Rush was MY band!!  All my friends loved the English bands (The Kinks, The Who, etc), but Rush made hard rock and Prog rock for most of us nerds...\n\nI am truly heartbroken, but I will always have their music to listen to and enjoy....Forever!   Thank You for the Tribute Bret Stephens.... somehow we have something very important to us both in common...",

After reading Mr. Stephens comments, and respecting him as I do, though I am an extreme liberal, politically, I was compelled to watch one of the Youtube videos to which he made reference.  I then, subsequently, watched ten more.  This is just an amazing band of musicians.  As he says, they are all at the height of their art, and, to a man, virtuoso.  The idea that they are \"the most hated band in music\" is a mystery.  Thank you, Mr. Stephens, for bringing my attention to this amazing trio.",

Had he mentioned his illness, the media spotlight would have been intense. I cant think of anything more disgusting to him then that. I wonder what he would have written about his own death? Probably something philosophic from a long past text to enlighten us, and to question our own thoughts on death. \n\nAs I play my favorite Rush record- Permanent Waves, I raise my glass of scotch to you Neil.

I raced home then tore the album cover in my haste to get it on the turntable. I sat with headphones, knees hugged to my chest, spellbound from groove to final groove. To this day my worldview and philosophies closely match the prose and poetry of Rush/Peart.\n\nI might add here that Frank Zappa had similar musical and political viewpoints. Likewise he thrived on the margins of popular rock music, shunned bright-lights celebrity, died way too young, and let his unparalleled virtuosity do all the talking.\n\nThese gents knew there was a more cerebral level to rock proving that if you go through life as a hammer, all you'll beat is nails.",

His daughter, his wife  dying.Being uncomfortable with fame and now cancer. I feel horrible. \nRush was my favorite band. Exit Stage Left is the album I have listened to more than any other music in my life. My favorite line from Neil was \"If you choose not to decide, you have still made a choice\". As a kid in high school I said \"I don't care\" often. Shrugged my shoulders. Now as a father I use that line to my sons.\nWhat has made Neil's passing have even more impact is the  amount of tributes and articles out on radio and now the internet. XM set up a tribute channel. How great is that? How friggin great!  I am not on social media so I don't know how that has been going but the news and the personal thoughts of the authors of the articles are so personal and heartfelt. \nI try to understand why this event has hurt so much. It must be because of the immense joy that Rush has given me since 1979.\n Geddy and Alex.I thank you for being so much joy and being a part of my life. We Love you guys",

My answer to that is Pink Floyd. There the guitar work  by Gilmour and bass by Waters were pretty up there, as was the keyboard work by Wright. Mason's drumming wasn't as showy as Peart's but still good but in terms of music and themes and CONCEPT, they beat out Rush. Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall - not one off songs but whole concept albums (yes, Rush tried this too but IMO didn't reach those heights). \n\nAlso Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime I think is one of the greatest concept albums ever. They've never replicated that success but that album would beat any of Rush's.\n\nI'd put Rush below Pink Floyd in terms of cerebral music but perhaps just.  You may see it the other way but to say other bands didn't do this and do it well is wrong.\n\nPrimus is another favourite band of mine that followed a template similar to Rush. Also extremely talented and I'd say less cerebral and more pop cultural lyrics.",

However, Mr. Stephens is right that the band attracted a larger cross-section of fans than your average hard rock band at the time. I think that was the band's appeal.

Great stuff and a wonderful tribute. Thanks.",

I have several of Rush's tracks on my playlists. Mr. Peart's percussion is the main reason. What a brilliant musician. Thank you for this piece- a fitting appreciation.",

For a drummer. For Rush. For all of us who grew up with their music that helped to shape our lives - even if just a little.\n\nFarewell to the King.",
