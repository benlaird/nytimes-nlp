What is detrimental is the lack of diligence in fact-finding, as demonstrated by some factions on the left.  It is exhausting to have to correct the misinformation posted in NY Times comment section.  Indeed,the fact is that Pete accepts *only* individual contributions, each capped at $2,800.  It doesn't bother me that Bernie is supported by dark money, has a network of wealthy donors (see vtdigger.org), got flagged by FEC for illegal and excess contributions in 639 pages in 2016.  It doesn't bother me that Warren got $175,000 from a wealthy doctor to purchase database from DNC, and while she doesn't do private fundraisers, her campaign treasurer and close allies do it for her.  But for someone who cares and is ready to lash out accusation at a candidate, please do due diligence.  And while most commenters here advocate \"vote blue no matter who,\"  some party leaders act the opposite - they are leading the misinformation campaign to tear the party apart.  For example, Pramila Jayapal, who is a surrogate of Bernie, tweeted a news article dated a year ago, ignoring the fact that Pete's campaign provide healthcare and officially acknowledge union of campaign workers.  It doesn't bother me that some factions intend to win by any means, at all cost.  But spare me the grand-standing and the talk of compassion for fellow citizens.",

I'm a Boomer and I'm a progressive.\nI'm a progressive that knows the only way we will win this election and avoid the possible end to our Democracy is to nominate a moderate that can win in the moderate states.\nIt is more than obvious that Sanders cannot win while promising to raise taxes on everyone...partially to supply free health care to anyone, including any illegal immigrant that waltzes across the border....because he basically advocates for open borders, too. \nHe's also saying that the Government should take over all the companies that supply us with electricity.  That would horrify moderate voters and Trump would have a hey day pummeling him relentlessly over his goofy ideas. \nRight now, Sander's opponents are basically going easy on him and not bringing up much about his history of being very friendly to left wing dictators.  Trump and his allies will have no problem turning him into Daniel Ortega..the vicious left wing dictator of Nicaragua because Sanderson once was a devotee of Ortega. \nI'm also a progressive that supported McGovern way back in 1972 when I was young and idealistic.  We were all certain he would defeat Nixon.  He won one State and even lost his own.  Pete has great ideas, is very intelligent, and we need some fresh blood running this Country.  Vote moderate.

For example, in todays Quinnipiac poll he beats Trump by 8 points, and beats Trump in almost every head to head poll this election cycle. Also he is seen favorably by more people than any other candidate, probably because of his reputation for authenticity, the consistency of his views and the clarity of his proposals. Lastly, and maybe most importantly, because of experience and political skill, he is viewed as very tough and able to bring the fight to Trump with confidence.  In an election where we can expect the kitchen sink to be thrown at whichever democrat is chosen, Bernie thrives in such circumstances, as his performances at Liberty U. and the Fox town hall demonstrated. With all of the candidates having their strengths and weakness from an electability perspective, these strengths put Bernie substantially above his rivals.",

Bernie is a dinosaur, not a leader.  He sounds like just the graying New Left boomers who live on my street in Berkeley, not  show a way forward, only a revolution nobody wants.\n\nWarren?  Bernie in a pants suit.  And her misappropriation of a Native American heritage is disqualifying.\n\nBiden is smarmy, corrupt and losing it mentally.  His peevishness is annoying not inspiring.\n\nKlobuchar is ok but too snarky.  Like a jello salad with some weird spice in it.\n\nSteyer?  Bloomberg?  I can see the bumper stickers now:  \"Our billionaire can beat your billionaire.\"  Inspiring.\n\nMy pick:  Mayor Pete.  He is articulate, brave, and represents generational change.

Those who are concerned about electability, struggling to determine who is the \"most electable Democratic candidate\" (MEDC) and to support that person versus their own preferred candidate, need to grapple with an understanding of just who are the potential voters they are concerned about. This MEDC is a crazy notion, hinging on two things: (1) Some liberal voters might not vote for the MEDC if s/he is not their preferred candidate; (2) there is a marginal group of voters who are not appalled by Trump and might vote for him if the MEDC is not the most centrist or right-leaning candidate. Everyone is trying to game-out this situation. Anyone in group (1) is a fraud or crazy. Anyone in group (2) is frightfully unaware of what is going on. Our democracy, hinging on pandering to these groups, is in very real danger. Those committed to Trump are irredeemable.",

I am especially ticked off on how for the second time in a row so many are terrified at the prospect of a Bernie Sanders nomination; and playing into the pathetic talking points of the pointy headed experts on cable T.V. repeating Trump talking points on why Sanders would be their favorite opponent. On FOX no less; they just had a group talk about how Trump fears both Bloomberg and Sanders most of all. The first for his $Billions which could match the G.O.P. money boys; and Sanders because he inspires more loyalty than any other Democrat and how he can play the populist game just as well (BETTER than) as Trump. Still Democrats want to repeat the failed policy of Hilary Clinton in ignoring the people who voted for Obama twice; and then voted for Trump having been ignored by the elitists in New York and California. They are the blind leading the blind. No Passion; NO CHANCE!",

America is so split that it feels as if we are headed into a civil war. Republicans as a party have shown that they condone lawlessness, defamation, brutality, and inequality. More than half of the country condemns those awful traits.\nThe disagreement really is that stark. Things have gotten very, very, ugly. The party of trump knows who they are, and they have shown that they will never relent in their quest for absolute dominance.\nIn comparison: non republicans are neither unified nor committed to the fight. The point is that if this is a war then there are not many sides. There are only two sides. One side disrespects everything and anything that defines the greatness of The United States. The other side will be defined according to what happens. I hope it turns out that the other (non republican) side is a massive majority that resoundingly rejects those who trample the laws, morals and ideals that America has always stood for.\n\nGet out the vote and end the nightmare.",

Please review the 2016 and 2018 voter turnout charts from the Pew Research Center below.\n\nIn 2016, Gen X + Millennial + Gen Z vote totals surpassed vote totals for Boomers + Silents.

He might team up with Amy Kloburchar as his VP, although I could personally see her as Pres. I think she's been underrated by too many.\n\nI wish the whole idea of \"polling\" had never been adopted. I think it is harmful to the entire process of nominations and elections. Also there should be a limited time period for campaigns (not more than 6 months)  a national holiday for all General Elections, and automatic voting registration for 18 year old citizens.\n\nI'd tell you more, but I have to go fix lunch.",

They fear that if Trump is gone, the looting and pillaging, the defiling and destroying by the top 1% of Americans will likely come to an end - i.e., an outcome they cannot abide.  They cannot imagine waking up to finding that the children are no longer in the cages.\n\nTrump has provided so much fodder for the self-indulgent, self-pitying, poverty-porn addicted democrats that they fear winning and depriving themselves of another four years of horror.  \n\nI hope that answers your question: no, Bernie supporters helped Trump win in 2016.  They will again in 2020.  Their tribe will lose all meaning if they win with another tribal leader.",

And history tells us what can happen later on. We know Trump envies the power and methodologies of Orban, Putin, Xi and others, and strives to be their equal. He has the temperament for it, he is ruthless, vindictive, unapologetic; he hates the freedom of the press, he is intolerant of criticism and will strive to eliminate all obstacles in his way. In fact he reminds me of Il Duce and Hitler, under whom I sadly lived in my childhood and became well acquainted with his tactics and crimes in the years after the war.

With regard to the thesis that we should vote for any Democrat nominated, I unfortunately don\u2019t agree with you. Yes, Trump is awful and I would love to see him gone but it is important which candidate we put forward to run against him. I will vote for any of those running except Biden and Buttigieg. To me, Biden sounds like a fool and Pete seems to be an empty suit of meaningless platitudes. When I hear either one of them speak I have a vision of the same broken, corrupt and dysfunctional government we have had for so long. Neither are inspirational or really honest. I\u2019m so distressed that they are currently running in the top four or five positions.",

Sanders, and particularly his followers, scare me in the sense of recalling a 20th century Soviet mindset.  Warren, less so but I disagree vehemently with her policies and her Trumpian plan to institute them by executive fiat.  Whoever is the nominee will have to earn my vote in the general election.

And they will be the largest single voting bloc for some time, and can easily consolidate Republican control.\n\nDemocrats can \"fine tune\" their messages and run the \"ideal\" candidate, but they will never win the support of Trump voters because to do so would require embracing bigotry. \n\nContrast Trump voters with Democrats - suburban white conservatives to young, very left-leaning voters. We are a much more heterogeneous voting bloc, and so of course it will be impossible for one candidate to appeal to all of us.

That's why monies spent on walls, military uniforms,Canteens, bullet maybe should be better spent on schools, infrastructure, Culture and things enriching our long life. The Republican Senators need not worry. They get soon a pension when they want, a solid Goverment check every month, and their kids are off kickin' it in Vail and the Cote.Are the  Republican Senators allowed to vote for a Democratic or Liberal  president ? If so ,and the Boss is dethroned, the Statue of Liberty stands a chance of not being turned into a waterslide.My guess, He may decide not to run and get back to being \"residential' as He's not realy  \"presidential\". And what does he need to be a constant target. He should relax and take care of his health.",

In most other countries, candidates have to earn your votes by espousing views and policies that do something for you; they don't just get your unconditional support because the bad man is bad. \n\nYes, obviously Trump is bad, but simply not being him isn't a platform and arguing for that _before the primaries have really begun_ let's the Democrats off the hook. You're encouraging them to not develop policies, to not reflect the desires of their base, to not stand for anything other than \"we're less terrible.\" I understand that Leonhardt is a consulting vampire with no interest in seeing things change because his situation is already great, but most of us have a vested interest in seeing the state of our politics improve.

They either stayed home, voted for Stein or voted for Trump.  What I've seen during the run up to the first Primary on 2020 seems to be worse than in 2016.  Leonhardt wants to look at the divisiveness in the campaign as one in which all parties have participated in equally, and that in the end their supporters will do what's in the best interest of the country and vote for whoever wins the nomination.   But if history tells us anything about what may happen in this election, it tells us that there will probably be enough Sanders supporters repeating what they did in 2016 to throw the general election to Trump.

There is one other person who desperately wants Bernie Sanders to win:  Donald Trump.   He was quick to suggest that Pelosi delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate so that the trial would conflict with some candidates' campaigning before the Iowa caucuses only to give Biden an advantage.   Trump knows how to inflame grievances.   Most importantly, he is trying to pick who he runs against.   That means doing everything to cast Biden as getting an unfair advantage in Iowa at the expense of Bernie (even suggesting that Biden should stop campaigning when his rivals were at the trial).   Democrats are so busy expressing their righteousness that they could never stop to consider what Trump wants.   Perhaps even more than Biden Trump is afraid of Bloomberg who would take away Trump's strongest suit:  \"only I know how to run an economy because I am a billionaire -- your 401Ks are safe under my care.\"  Debunk that claim and Trump melts like the wicked witch doused with water.",

First he actually won it despite delusional claims of many in the media.The disdain expressed for voters who support DJT certainly will not them to vote D. Not everyone believes in third term abortions, confiscation of guns, constant harping about white racism, and other talking points.  Guess what, Mr. Trump will claim he made progress with China, a new North American trade deal, lowered taxes for the middle class (true despite claims otherwise) and created a great economy. All true to an extent. He also did something that will last long after his term(s)..called out the media for what it is. It resonates out here in the hinterlands. Personally I like Ms. Warren. An inauthentic progressive university type who gamed the affirmative action racket. Even real Indians will vote against her!!!",

You gave into AOC\u2019s people and now that\u2019s all the folk that will support you.\n\nThe centrists keep hoping enough centrist voters will support them, even if for now they remain quiet about it.\n\nBut there is none that can appeal to both.

As MLK explained, the passage of time alone creates no change; what we do, deliberately, with time changes our reality. And if ever the signs of the time demanded change, now is that time: this is a unifying slogan.\n\nThe rhetoric of \"no matter who\" works against unity; it divides with distrust at the very moment when we need to reprise democratic values. It stifles debate. In these ways, it is Trumpian at its core!\n\nIt alienates the most motivated voters, voters who most need politics to work for them, voters whom Dems most need for victory--the most oppressed voters--because we know it DOES \"matter who\"! And because we've heard it so many times before, with no follow-through, that commitment to responsive policies must now-as-never-before be a non-negotiable requirement for our votes.\n\nWomen, especially of color or working class or reproductive age, also minority or working-class men, immigrants and their children, protesters against white supremacy, all targetted groups are actively suffering the oppression of Trumpian bigotry and death-of-democracy policies. Let me repeat the word \"suffering.\"\n\nDems do not deserve to win if we ignore Trump's oppression and adopt his own divisive rhetoric.",

But David's right: the two wings of the Democratic Party are not enemies, and they share far more than they disagree upon. So, while the candidates \"fight\" through the primary season, how about injecting persuasion into their discourse? Buzz words like \"socialism\" have come to have so much power because we have relied on them as intellectual shortcuts, to the point where they are only fighting words, or code.  Why is universal government- guaranteed health care - however you brand or approach it - the right solution? Why is fairness served by redistributive corrections like a wealth tax, a financial transaction tax, changes in capital gains and inheritance taxation? It ought to be relatively easy to persuade people that while fairness is a worthy goal, both perfectionism and cynicism are self-defeating. Couldn't we back off a little bit from our emphasis on the metrics of winning and losing, in favor of an approach that lets us be persuasive by addressing each other with respect?  After all, you can't persuade anyone of anything if you are sneering at them, trying to trip them up and humiliate them. Cruelty, vindictiveness and mendacity are Trump's tactics. We - Democrats and independents and ordinary decent unaffiliated voters - shouldn't adopt them. They don't suit our message or our aspirations.",

It's great to have supporters, but as the Senate Trial just proved cults are dangerous to democracy. Most of the comments agree that Trump has to be replaced ASAP.

So Sanders claiming that his supporters will stand behind his every decision is delusional. His supporters didn't like Clinton so they voted for Trump. Basically Sanders is not and never has been a Democrat. So an explanation is needed before I believe he will support and his supporters will vote for any Democrat. Their blackmailing the party is dangerous and we got Trump the last time.

Forget about all of the different shades of policy for now. A street fighter needs to emerge. From a distance, there only seems to be two current candidates who can effectively grapple with Trump, Pete Buttigieg and Mike Bloomberg.\n\nKnowingly or unknowingly, Buttigieg is using a strategy developed by one of the best politicians of the past sixty years, Muhammad Ali, called \"rope-a-dope\" to outmaneuver his Democratic opponents. He's laying back, and letting them \"punch themselves out.\" Clearly, it helps being a Rhodes Scholar and a Naval Officer. A wise street fighter, indeed, who is carrying virtually no political baggage.\n\nUnlike Trump, Bloomberg comes with real political and leadership experience. An old cliche goes that being the mayor of New York City is a harder job than being president of the United States. He won't be beholden to others for financial support, so he can be tough on Trump without having to compromise his words. Bloomberg, a sophisticated businessman with some street fighting traits, but who admittedly carries a bit of political baggage.\n\nIt will be an interesting few months, indeed.",

Understand, dear reader, this is a critical fight at a critical time for the future of the party and the country.

If it's a fair contest, then lots of Bernie supporters will undoubtedly vote for the candidate who defeats Bernie in November.

Why is intelligent, educated Mayor Pete dangerous? Well, he wants to throw out the Constitution and write a new one, and he is smart enough to shroud this in pseudo-rational thinking. After all, he is a Rhodes Scholar. Trump, if he wins, will be gone in 4 years, but a Constitution change will be with us forever. First, he wants to make the Supreme Court a horror - with 15 members selected by an uncontrollable combination of methods. Who knows what would come of that? Second, he wants to abolish the Electoral College, which was instituted in Germany after World War II to try to prevent another HItler, and gives smaller states some greater influence in order to allow a federal system in a country the size of a whole continent. And, if the Electoral College has no reason, why have a Senate? Most of the time, the candidate getting more votes wins anyway. Throwing out the Senate and Electoral College, expanding the Supreme Court, would go a long way to establishing Sen. Schumer's dream - turning the USA into a parliamentary republic. Anybody not scared of THAT should watch what is going on in Italy, Germany, Spain and Israel right now. We are so emotional about what we have, we may just be ready to jump from the frying pan into the fire. Chaos anybody?",

I\u2019d also like progressives to stop disparaging me for having dared to support the woman who won the popular vote.

We\u2019ve already lost the front-runner, which is exactly what Trump wanted.  Wake up and smell the coffee and stop the general disparagement of anyone but him.

To sit out the election if my favorite candidate doesn't get the nomination is following the rules Trump/GOP have laid out. They have succeeded in elevating the small picture of hyper partisanship.",

Bernie is not a Democrat, he's a socialist.

I believe he is the only candidate that understands or has advisors that understand the economy and the federal debt and deficit. I think his proposal for M4A is by far the most efficient plan and is supported by overwhelming data.

I will support them as much as their policies allow. I will support the policies Leonhardt names--climate heating, gun regulation, abortion, etc. But if they get things wrong like \"M4A will bankrupt the country\", I will point out their error.\n\nIt is hard to write against the proposals of a stupid ignorant incompetent imbecile like Trump since mostly they do not exist and when they do, they change moment to moment.

I also love how Trump really, really dislikes Mike. \n\nHow will I vote on Super Tuesday? Most likely to succeed in the polls at that time - of the broad coalition of the DNC. I like Warren, but I don't like her policies, and I do not want to see Bernie nominated - especially when I cannot see him winning a general election. \n\nPolicies count. Politics count. Style, relationships, presentation counts. What counts most for me in November? A big D next to that person's name. To that end, we're also donating to key democratic contenders against Collins, McConnell, McSally, and a few other Senate races. I live in a blue state, but I'm concerned about our country more than I am my local elections. I will be pulling the DNC lever across the board, knowing that's how we raise up future candidates as well.",

I hear talk of a desire for real and substantial change in the American political system that is matched only by their fear that they are doomed to inherit a world of environmental calamity's and economic uncertainties. They are saddled by student loan debt and do not see a way out. But perhaps the biggest  impression I am left with is their feeling that older white men have failed them, their country and that they do not represent them or their generation. From my position this is going to be the group that will make or break the Democrat's future.

Dems most often learn harsh economic truths in the pursuit of financial sustainability/funding. Unfortunately, human impulse is generally towards equality or generosity. Equality is as undesirable as it is unrealizable. Attempting to achieve equality requires that each of us forego who we are & what we can do in order to create something in which no one ultimately believes - a society everybody is the same or has the same. It\u2019s very common for people to change economic philosophies & political parties based upon experiences, education & self interest during their lifetime. Democrats have to understand our emotional side is like an elephant & our rational side, it's rider. Perched atop the elephant, the rider holds the reins & seems to be the leader. But the rider's control is precarious because the rider is so small relative to the elephant since it is not reason who guides life, but customs. Trump understands that a belief doesn't have to be the truth - what matters is the utility of the belief (even if it's a lie). As Trump relentlessly pokes the elephant with lies, Dems can't take the  bait.  If Dems want to change how things are, they shouldn't be fixated on language since most talk is cheap & language-games won't set us free. Dems must vote in 2020, despite at  times feeling alienated, cut off from Rep & themselves as Trump's base seem contented, untroubled & free of worries.",

I was reading on the FiveThirtyEight website about the lively possibility of a contested convention. Perhaps that's good thing. We don't have to decide today.  We may not be able to. For now, without setting our collective hair-on-fire TOO often, we can fully gauge our candidate pool, our polls, our situation, Trump's relative strengths and weaknesses.

I do not dispute that the GOP is the party that speaks out of both sides of its mouth, asserting there is no free lunch but giving away the environment and corporate welfare year after year after.  But it makes no sense for Democrats to be equally reckless, and that is what Sen Sanders promises, indeed promotes.  Worse, the Sanders' promise isn't just captured in the use of the word 'free'.  It says in effect each of us as citizens has no responsibility.  We aren't obligated to work to pay the bills; we aren't obligated to do sit ups to stay fit, et/c.  This it seems is incredible corrosive to the notion that you give to get, not just get.  Rallying the troops to ensure the current President is not re-elected is one thing.  Supporting another version of reckless profligacy is quite another, and I suspect most Democrats are actually not willing to defeat Trump if it means trading in a core conviction of personal responsibility somewhere in the formula.",

But there is no doubt that a Hilary Clinton White House would have allowed Wall Street, multinational corporations, special interests and the one-percenters to maintain their lock on public policy.

That leaves the middle (Yang, Klobuchar, Biden, Buttigieg) as the only candidates whose decision to exit can be signaled by the desertion of a handful of large money donors. We may well see some dropouts after New Hampshire, after South Carolina at the latest.\n\nOthers have mentioned various inverse pairings (e.g., Sanders/Klobuchar vs Klobuchar/Sanders). I would argue that unless the nominee is Buttigieg, the pairing should be older/younger. We find ourselves in this mess in part because Joe Biden was Obama's VP. Aside from personal issues, he would have been the natural nominee in 2016. That moment passed. He shouldn't have jumped in this time around.

It was clear that Clinton was a polarizing figure, which is why so many Democrats supported Obama in 2008. It was a mistake for Clinton to run and for the DNC to back her in 2016. This is a failure of the party apparatus rather than any bloc of Democratic voters. Not all qualified individuals make good candidates.\n\nI'm fed up with accusations that Sanders backers won't support anyone else. Like in 2016, the DNC is trying to undermine Sanders; a huge mistake given his strong following among young voters who should be the future of the party but they are not fools and they see how corporatist Democrats are not getting it done for their generation.\n\nThere are just as many stories about conservative Democrats not willing to support Sanders or Warren. Shall we label these people \"Buttigieg Bros\" and sneer at them?\n\nI suppose this is what David is writing about though I don't  personally know any Dems who won't vote for the nominee. Instead of claiming that one candidates' supporters won't vote for the eventual nominee, we should direct our ire at the DNC, which is clearly trying to manipulate the vote once again (see John Kerry's overheard phone call) to nominate an establishment Democrat, regardless of his ability to beat Trump.",

But other developed countries show us there are still other ways to provide universal, affordable, quality care. In 2017 a TIMES Upshot article ran a mock tournament matching up systems of 8 countries. The descriptions show a lot more variations than the candidates are offering, with the \"winner,\" Switzerland, providing a mix of public & private insurance options but with the caveat that private insurers must provide mandated coverage on a NONPROFIT basis. (They can make a profit only on added services.) Sounds to me like a potential way to cover many more people at lower costs without scaring people that they'll lose private insurance. I'm not saying the Swiss plan is best for the U.S. But there are other potentially more effective & politically viable options than those being offered. That article looked at only 7 other countries and showed plenty of options. As voters, we deserve more options on health care in the debate.

I think Senator Sanders should be asked pointedly, and soon, by the media 2 things:\n1- Will he publicly and via social media point out the existential crisis the country faces if the incumbent is re-elected, and implore his rabid supporters to support the ultimate Democratic nominee. He should not be allowed to simply say he has no control over his most ardent supporters and leave it at that. His leadership in this regard is critical and might sway a portion of his legions to support the ultimate nominee if not Senator Sanders.\n2-Senator Sanders should be asked directly if he himself would STRONGLY support the nominee and not simply be allowed to pay lip service to the idea that of course he would.\nThe country cannot be held hostage by a significant, and loud constituency who will only support their populist candidate on the left. The country is in peril and yes if the Sanders supporters fail to support any Democratic candidate other than Senator Sanders, we will indeed have a revolution, but on the right and sink further into the authoritarian morass we now find ourselves.",

Politicians have cried wolf every election but this really is the most critical election. Our democracy literally depends on it. The revolution can wait.",

They can count on the 2 party Dems to tear each other to shreds during the primaries, then refuse to support the candidate if he/she is not their political paramour. Meanwhile, the Republican monolith persists, everyone standing in a straight line behind Trump all the way to the horizon and beyond. 90% Republican approval rating as of this January, trending upward.\n\nWhat it comes down to is exactly what Mr Leonhardt points out --- Democrats cannot win if they go into this election as 2 separate parties, each hesitant or refusing to support the other because of ideological purity. The specter of Trump as a 2nd term president is omnipresent. A 3 party election in 2020 guarantees him that 2nd term.",

Now one of those horrible options will again be on the ballot, and he shouldn't be allowed a 2nd term under any circumstance. It was in 5 states that he was able to garner enough votes (80k) to take the electoral college, lets hope those democrats, republicans and independents who stayed home turn out in big numbers is those states. As I see it trump will have to hope for a repeat, as the popular vote margin was 3 million in 2016, and will be even wider in 2020, so its another electoral college win or we can send him packing. I am for the second choice. vote blue 2020!!!",

This is where the battle in the Dem party plays out.  Sanders' strong consistent message energizes the progressive wing of the party, but may be be frightening to less liberal Americans. Biden's message may be comforting to older, more moderate Dems but may be viewed as \"boring\", \"status quo\" or \"too little, too late\" by the progressive wing of the party. The other candidates' positions fall along a spectrum from Warren (closest to Sanders) to Klobuchar & Bennett (closest to Biden); Bloomberg & Yang are difficult to pigeon hole. This diversity of ideas w/in the Dem party is both a strength and a weakness; a weakness if Dem voters do not accept the party's nominee (as happened in 2016 with many Sanders' supporters), but a strength only if all Dems can unite behind the nominee. This is a must if the nation is to move beyond the nightmare of Trump.

A minimum wage increase, job training, relocation help, and much more.\n\na life which includes affordable and good healthcare.  Don't close rural hospitals, don't drive people into bankruptcy because of a serious health condition.\n\na life which does not include desolation because of destruction from floods and fires - help in case of emergency and, every day, help healing climate change.\n\na life where children can get a good public education.  This means early life childcare, good public schools and help with college admission and expenses.\n\nAnd, most importantly, respect for everyone.

No, he was an inevitability thanks to everything from our poor education system, our lack of healthcare, poverty, ignorance, propaganda, our hubris from foreign policy, etc. Nominating and electing another Democrat who is friendly with corporate interests, only gives *some* people healthcare, only does the bare minimum against climate change, and does little to truly change the rules of the game will just pave the way for another Trump and/or kick the can down the road in terms of the long-term health and sustainability of this country.\n\nThe nation\u2019s problems go far beyond Donald Trump. And they will exist after he\u2019s gone unless we try something new. The status quo cannot continue. Try telling millions of people in poverty and without healthcare that candidates like Buttigieg and Bloomberg are the same as Warren or Sanders. We need bold, progressive ideas. For once.",

She gets along well with others including folks from the other side of the aisle, and is balanced and reasonable.\n\nAmy's responses on foreign policy issues during the last two debates were out of the park. And Amy hasn't changed positions on key issues like health care, and does not propose out of this world projects that have zero chance of being passed by Congress.\n\nMost of all, she's been an honest broker on her positions from the get go, and would be the best of all candidates in putting Trump on the defensive, all while she's got that midwestern grin and wit, and yes, a , super, well honed, sense of humor.\n\nAmy has the best chance of grabbing undecideds and knocking Trump off.

It's horrible and unfortunate, but one also has to understand that it's likely that that portion of Sanders voters may not and never will vote for a Democrat.  These are radical greens and radical libertarians that have always voted 3rd party.  People are losing their minds over two competing narratives; one is that Bernie is not a \"true Democrat\" so they're angry he's running as a Democrat.  What would they prefer, that he run as a True 3rd party candidate?  He's running as a Democrat because he knows he needs to unite if he doesn't win. Two is that people are angry that Bernie has a portion of people who won't vote for other candidates., as I mentioned, and as proven in 2016,  these people likely NEVER would have voted for a Democrat... so then he'd be bringing in more votes under a new Democrat umbrella... isn't that what we want? \nObviously we'd like all those never-Democrat voters that Bernie brings in to still vote no matter who the nominee.",

For the most part, those on the left have held their noses and voted for the party and its corporate masters with only a small minority defecting to third party candidates.

If Iowa caucus voters barely exceeded their 2016 numbers, then the DNC better start working on a messaging system. Getting them to vote in the caucus and primaries and they will turn out for the General Election.\n\nSo, here is my \"kindly meant\" offering for an ad. Since pictures are worth a thousand words, this one picture, broadcast prominently, would be a galvanizer for women and we have to hope all the good men out there too:\n\n....this ad would contain 3 pictures side by side and all the same size in one unspoken sentence....Far Left - Trump... and it  would be one of the many crazy, wild looking pictures of a red ranting face with white circles around the eyes;  Middle - McConnell;  Right - Kavanaugh in Senate hearing during his wild rant.\n\nAt the top of this picture would be ONE word - COURTS!  That's it.\n\n...But Democrats have a fertile field of material to choose from and I just wish they would get on with it.  Like James Carville said, Trump's comments at Davos that he is considering cutting back funding for Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare ought to be ripe for Dems.  ... and I would say it could be their non-fiction equivalent to the Willie Horton ad.",

At the very least, that would narrow our choices from eight to four, which would be much easier for us to handle. Moreover, such pairings would provide a nice balance, not only in ideology but also of style.

Carter won on backlash for Nixon pardon & Watergate, Clinton won arguably because of Ross Perot siphoning votes from Bush Sr. and Obama won because of economic crash and Sarah Palin as McCain's VP pick. And none of them were running a far left progressive campaign. I hope someone can convince me that Sanders can win but I just don't see it. It's much easier for R's to sell nostalgia, racism, and mythical past glory as opposed to a far left progressive dream for a Scandinavian style Socialist Democracy. The countries where SD seems to work best tend to be much smaller and much less diverse. Just stopping the current farce in power would be a huge step forward. I believe a Bloomberg/Amy K.

For one, Eisenhower was a fiscal conservative who maintained a balanced budget.  Nothing about Medicare for All, especially Bernie's no specifics on how to pay for a $4T year program (with a failing Federal agency that reimburses so little that rural clinics are closing) would create a balanced budget, nor would Elizabeth's Constitutionally questionable wealth tax.  Our current proposed Federal budget is only slightly more than MC4A at $4.8B.  Further differences are Eisenhower's reducing military spending by 20%, (which neither have S or W have advocated), the Lavender Scare, where gays, and lesbians were denied government service, his tacit agreement with McCarthyism, his supporting non-Democratic strong men in Latin America (to say nothing of ousting Mossadegh), and the Eisenhower Doctrine of US military intervention for any nation invaded in the Middle East, would likely resemble either of their administrations.  At least I really, really hope not.  That Democrats must unite should be a given, on this we agree, but shamefully not all in the big tent party are willing to let go of their sacred cows to do so.  I volunteer to, if required.  Our political choices are sadly only binary, hence the our frequent polarity.",

A meeting of candidates would be almost unprecedented in American history but then we are facing a choice, and danger, that is, in fact, unprecedented as well.\n\nOf what should this meeting consist? True patriots should gather to cut short the rest of the nominating process. Someone will likely have a big lead at that point and it might be a good idea for all but one other candidate to quit, or perhaps all of them. Of course, this would be very, very difficult given the time, dedication and campaign contributions needed just to be competitive but, unlike the Republicans in the Senate, the Democrats need to put the country first, their political ambitions second.\n\nIf this were to happen, spring and summer of 2020 could be a time of healing and gathering support for the likely winner of the nomination.

This trend, which Obama threatened to challenge but eventually went along with, is very troublesome to progressives.

My hope is that all of the candidates will make a similar commitment to work for the eventual nominee no matter who that is.  I understand the frustration of people who want to support and ultimately elect a third party candidate.  However, right now, the only imperative is to defeat Trump, so in November, there are two (2) choices: Trump or the Democratic nominee. If you don't want Trump, you must vote for the Democrat.  I will never forgive Sanders, who lost the nomination and then went home to sulk instead of actively campaigning for Clinton and telling his supporters to vote for her.  Many of them voted for Trump instead.  Are they happy with the result? Mind you, if Sanders is the candidate, I will work hard to elect him.

It would be a terrific public service for the Times to start filling in a grid on the policy differences between the major candidates.

Just more business as usual.  Incremental initiatives are easily slow-walked and diverted and watered down.  Big Structural Change is not.  Big Change gains momentum and controversy, which is why it's easier to make happen.\n\nA non-Moderate would also pull those who supported Bernie away from the Trumpsters, rather than push many Progressives over to Trump, who has the very attractive quality of being against the status-quo.  No one can deny that his anarchy shakes things up, which is phase one of any change initiative.  A non-Moderate will also stop the millions of Trumpsters from voting passionately against the Moderate, as with Hillary.\n\nModerates (Republicans) have not learned a thing from 2016.  That alone makes it impossible to support them.  The only viable choice is Trump, or a Progressive.  If not in 2020 than in 2024.",

Harboring grudges is a relationship killer.\n\nWe have a remarkable group of talented people in the candidates.  I really believe that.  My plan is to primary vote for the one I think most likely to win in November, but then wholeheartedly support whoever is the nominee. \n\nOnce we have a clear nominee, I plan to support that person's candidacy 100%.  Because they are all moving to the left, I can easily do that.  \n\nOnce we argue for a position we strongly think is right, it is hard to back away from that.  This is like holding a grudge. \nCompromise requires that we do so, that we look at the other person's viewpoint and admit that they may have a point/be smart.  This takes some humility, too.\n\nSo, the above saying might be instead--We can be right or we can win in November with a unified party.\n\nWouldn't it be great if we had a party unified around progress on the goals all candidates espouse?  Unity based in looking at the value in a community that cares rather than a coalition of selfishness and grudge-holding like the President and Senate.",

In fact, the opposite happened, the wealth gap increased tremendously which is the main reasons for our political division.\n\nWe have a rigged system where elected officials must concubine for those with money to win elections instead of servicing their people.  Meanwhile half our citizens have disengaged from the political process feeling that their vote doesn\u2019t count and you can\u2019t blame them. We have politicians glorify America\u2019s riches while the costs of education, healthcare, transportation, communication, etc. are more than other advanced economies.\n\nInstead of empowering our young to  improve society, we  burdened them with debt making them poorer than their parents. Meanwhile the GOP continues to give tax cuts to service their donors starving the nation, given them an excuse no not spend for our future. This created a divisive society, where the right blames, people of color, women, secular and/or educated people and the left blames, the right and their puppeteers the GOP.\n\nThe two candidates who advocate mitigating the corrupt effects of money in politics, reducing the wealth gap by taxing the rich are, Warren and Sanders are called socialists akin to failed states of Cuba, Venezuela, etc. Warren's personality of seeking compromised as apposed to Bernie's stubbornness makes her a better choice.",

After talking to people about who they support and why I support the candidate I do - while trying to pursuance and stay positive, it\u2019s obvious that all Democrats agree on the why and what of 2020, and we can find a lot of common ground on the how - so long as we recognize the value everyone brings.\n\nI encourage everyone to get engaged and talk to real human beings.",

Rankin then leapt to his feet and shouted in Celler\u2019s face: \u201cI am getting tired of the gentleman from New York raising the Jewish question in the House and then jumping on anyone who says anything about it\u2026I wonder if the gentleman knew that 90% of the doctors who get on the Civil Service rolls are Jews and 60% of the ones we are compelled to accept in our veterans\u2019 hospitals are Jews. Remember that the white Gentiles of this country also have some rights.\u201d The Southern code of honor had obviously relaxed some in the 90 years since the Brooks- Sumner incident. Rankin was content to scream and shake his fist at Celler rather than bludgeon him with a cane. Progress continues to our own day: Rand Paul\u2019s aggression is mostly passive.

Podcast, episode Sept. 18, 2019: The Family Business, there is an interesting interview with Solomon Larte (spelling ?) a records management analyst under four US presidents. He worked in the Office of Presidential Records (OPR). Federal law states that every piece of paper that crosses the president\u2019s desk becomes part of the presidential record. Everything is forwarded to the OPR to be catalogued and filed. Everything proceeded normally until Trump became president. First, OPR found out that official docs were being thrown in the trash. Initially, OPR figured that perhaps T-rump did not know, so he was informed. That\u2019s when Larte began receiving Manila folders of documents that had been ripped into \u2018thumb-sized pieces\u2019 by the president before being sent to the OPR. Larte said that the OPR staff were then tasked with painstakingly taping the docs back together, \u2018like doing a jigsaw puzzle\u2019. He must have been too good at that, because after 25 years, a top secret clearance, and three other presidents, he was informed that his top secret clearance would not be renewed (you\u2019re gone).

No matter what occurs in reality, sanctimonious liberals and conservatives both will interpret it in whatever way confirms their infallible beliefs and moral high-ground, and then they will present it as indubitable fact. To paint Rand Paul's outing of the whistle blower as a bold and bullying attempt to \"scare off all future whistleblowers\" (you make meek Rand Paul sound like Luca Brasi) conveniently ignores the fact that multiple reports have shown that the whistleblower had professional ties and a previous relationship with Joe Biden; which, whether juicy or substantive or not (probably not), would be jumped on and thoroughly \"investigated' by, you know, the fearless journalists of the NYT, were the tables turned and it was Republican blowing a whistle on a Democrat. In my view, the two parties and their groupthinkers at the top truly deserve eachother...the intellectual character of Liberals is essentially Sean Hannity wearing blue instead of red, refined with P.H.D. language and an aura of moral grandiosity.

Ironically, it was southern Democrats that taught modern Republicans how to do this, as the author points out.\n\nThe cover picture of Preston Brooks about to strike Senator Sumner really goes to the heart of this political hard ball. Brooks was celebrated as a hero in his home state, and the Federal government never brought any criminal charges against him. Sumner near died and was left with permanent impairment.\n\nPainting with a broad brush, The South runs rough shod over basic principals of human dignity, civil rights, fair play, and basic principals of decorum. Since 1876 when the North negotiated with the South to make R. Hayes president in exchange for Northern troops to vacate, we have seen how the South retained its authoritarian traditions which imbues its political leaders with an arrogant disdain for the \"other,\" as the examples in this essay reveal.",

In most cases, the whistleblower will not provide hard evidence - just suspicion.

The whistleblower should have no role in either investigation or determination - though may remain an interested, but anonymous, party.  Key fact:  maintaining whistleblower anonymity is critical to having whistleblowers with courage to come forward with important information.

In the post truth era of Donald's persistent mocking bullying lying and provable crimes, it's absolutely amazing for any Republicans to express outrage over this- but yet, they did.  They haven't uttered word ONE about the constitutional crises that currently surrounds us, and calling out Nancy reveals the GOP's core of hypocrisy.",

Adam Schiff or his committee before filing an official whistleblower complaint within the State Department and then used the filing to protect his or her identity.  If true, that is plainly an abuse of the statute. Such gamesmanship would disqualify him or her from the statute's protection.\n\nAt a minimum the State Department Inspector General and the Justice DoJ owe it to us to investigate whether the process was abused and take appropriate actions.

Case in point, two weeks ago Trump tweeted that he was the one who protected our right to have pre-existing conditions covered in our health insurance.  Trump has over 72 million Twitter followers (40 million fewer than Obama) who hang on his every word.  For him to tell such a monstrous lie - and this is a 100% pure lie, not some form of hyperbole - knowing his base will eat it up and repeat ad nauseam over social networks is nothing short of treason.  He has betrayed the Trust of the American people.  Not only did he NOT protect pre-existing conditions in our health insurance, he has been trying to eliminate that very protection since he took office.  But please go on about Nancy tearing up Trump's manifesto of lies.",

He clearly deserves an official censure since he \"breached confidentiality\" and for \u201cconduct that tends to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute\u201d.\n\nThe absence of any sort of honor of the office of Senator by the GOP has been amply demonstrated throughout the entire Impeachment trial.  The public was made aware on a daily basis that facts no longer matter - the only thing that seems to carry any weight with the GOP is maintaining its power through their complicity with and support of 45's authoritarian agenda.\n\nThe electorate must rise up in November and make sure that these charlatans parading as their representatives are kicked out and replaced by upstanding and ethical candidates.  If not, our beloved democracy will be lost forever.",

The Republican party has violated too many norms and values of our democracy and are now poised to undo the fabric of the republic. They must be stopped.\n\nFirst step - whether you are a Republican by birth or choice, you have to recognize that they are granting IMPUNITY to President Trump, and by extension his cabinet secretaries and themselves. This violates our Constitutional Republic and they must be removed from office asap. This November you have to vote out the incumbent Republican Representative and Senator in your district. Vote Libertarian, Independent, Democrat, Green, whatever, but your duty to your nation requires you vote out those who grant impunity to anyone and subvert the law to their political ends. I would say the same thing if the culprits were Democrats or Independents. \n\nIn 200 years or so, when people look back at this era, they will see the dishonest excuses offered by Collins, Alexander, Murkowski, Cruz, Paul, etc... and also note the cowards who claimed Trump had done nothing wrong. They should see this abuse of power punished by the electorate, from 200 years distance, they should see it clearly. Mitch McConnell should not receive more than 15% of the vote this time in Kentucky. Write in Abraham Lincoln if you must, but do not give any more power to these power-addicts!

His main purpose was mainly political, demonstrating that the GOP will brook no variance from its hegemony and threatening anybody who at any time might oppose their party line.  It is another step in the deliberate process of making the nation a one party system, with the Republicans under a dictatorial leader controlling every branch of the federal government, their own thought police, and most state houses as well.\n\nThis is where we find ourselves today: exactly as the minority of wealthy slave owning planters ruled over their slaves and the rest of the majority of their Southern populations in their own interests, and cajoled and threatened (and whipped) the rest of the states into falling in line, so today does the shrinking minority of Republicans seek to control every aspect of the government and extend its power into citizens\u2019 personal lives as well.\n\nEveryone is created equal... but some - through their wealth, their anger, or their religion - deserve to be more equal than others, according to the Republican Party.\n\nThe last time we reached such a pass the result was the Civil War. Now, I hope we have enough sense to just encourage the backward-looking red states to secede, let them go back to their idealized and theocratic past, and stop subsidizing them so we can tackle the challenges of the actual future.",
