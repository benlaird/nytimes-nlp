It's nothing but cruel and it's been going on for way too long.  And Netanyahu has absolutely no intention of changing anything.  They were supposed to be negotiating over land that Israel had occupied. But how do the Palestinians negotiate for land that is slowly being swallowed up by Israeli settlements. The Israelis have never been serious about giving the Palestinians their own homeland.  That is extremely obvious by now.",

Islamist antisemitism is not so hard to pick out, either. when imams spout it from the pulpit and it is expressed on the Arab street. African-American and Latinx antisemitism is harder to call out, because of the natural leftist inclination to justify it, make excuses for it, and disinclination to call out POC for anything that might put their leftist votes at risk. General leftist antisemitism is hardest of all, because of how pervasive it is in the academy, and because many left-of-center Zionists have learned to keep their heads down and mouths shut lest their careers and futures be wrecked. But make no mistake. Calling for the end of Israel as a Jewish state is as antisemitic as calling for the end of Sweden as a Swedish state is anti-Swedish, and it doesn't help to profess love for the Swedes and/or the Jews.",

But a lot of adults can\u2019t, either, including, I would argue, the authors of this piece, who conflate anti-Zionism with antisemitism. I grew up thinking Zionism was racist; I still do. But it does not compare to the unrivaled horror of Nazism, and conflating the two is wrong. \n\nMy father is now an American citizen, and a registered Democrat. He would never admit it, but he hates the Jews. He also hates Israel. It is the hatred for the same thing: He can\u2019t seem to help conflating the two. It is as if the trauma of 1948, which he endured around age five, has glued everything together into one blazing ball of hatred. If you listen to his story, and hear about my grandmother being shot at, and about leaving in the middle of the night with tank blasts coming from the north, maybe you can understand the feeling\u2014even if the sentiment is racist.

To silence opinions curbs students' ability to make their own judgments and suggests that students cannot determine right from wrong. When schools begin to censor what ideas their students are exposed to, progress, as well as our education, is stunted. When the rabbis write, 'it is our diversity that strengthens society' does this not include the diversity of opinion? \n\nThe teacher in question was always welcoming of students in every learning environment. The students' opinions and ideas were always respected. Likewise, the teacher's perspective was always appreciated by their students even when we disagreed. \n\nI do not feel in any way that I have been taught to demonize Israel through my school or my teachers nor do I feel that any of the faculty at Fieldston have vilified Israel's right to exist. In fact, through the diversity of opinions I have been exposed to in my education, I have been able to find and honor my Jewish identity.",

And, at its origin, Israel was a colonial construct. It would be so healing to admit that.\n Then, Boer South Africa and Rhodesia and the Ottoman Empire, and later, the Nazi puppet regime of central and western Europe... all were challenged and fought against.

The leading governments of the world simply didn't want anything to do with Jews and sought to plop them somewhere that won't pose them any problems - enter Palestine. The fact that Israel was gifted land belonging to others should be at least humbling for Israeli's, but it appears to inexplicably be the opposite. They seem emboldened to advocate for and act aggressively, and stubbornly, against any semblance for peace by land-grabbing more land that doesn't belong to them. I know many vociferously disagree and would be quick to pick up a Bible to prove Israel belongs to Israeli's.

While some people who oppose Christian supremacy might do so because they hate Christians I think most people would be able to distinguish between opposing a Christian supremacist government and hating Christians.  I can't speak for every anti-Zionist or critic of the policies of the Israeli government towards Palestinians under it's control, but I can say that I wholeheartedly support defending Jews wherever they may live from discrimination and violent attack by anti-Semites while at the same time I oppose Zionism because it is in practice a policy of Jewish supremacy over and ethnic cleansing of non-Jews in the state of Israel.

Jews were there a long, Long, LONG time ago.  Then post-1945 flooded into what the British called \"Palestine.\"  The British at first tried to keep them out, but couldn't and gave up because of both Jewish and Arab terrorism.  Then the \"jewish state\"was declared and certified by the UN and the war started during which Palestinian leaders inflamed their populations with anti-Jewish propaganda and false accusations of massacres and what not, urging Palestinians to flee when they didn't need to.  And so millions of them fled and never got a chance to return.  And that's where they remain today. It has not been settled.",

Listening to her D'var Torah, her interpretation of the portion of the Torah she had read, changed my views on Judaism forever. \n\nShe spoke from the book of Leviticus, about how you should leave part of your vineyard for the poor. She then raised her most poignant point: that while not everybody owns vineyards anymore, the morals of these ancient teachings are what matter, not necessarily the exact text.\n\nSo it is with Israel. As an American, Reform Jew who believes in the fundamental human rights of everyone (including Palestinians), I believe that it is my right and my duty to stand up against injustice, even when it is perpetrated by a state that I feel deep sympathy for. \n\nAs Jonathan Weisman wrote last year, \"younger American Jews do not typically remember Israel as the David against regional Goliaths. They see a bully, armed and indifferent, 45 years past the Yom Kippur War, the last conflict that threatened Israel\u2019s existence\". \n\nIsrael, as it stands now, is fundamentally flawed. While the Palestinians are not blameless, they have been persecuted for decades. It's time for an Israeli reckoning.",

This is not the Protocols of the Elders of Zion claiming that all Jews are in a nefarious plot.  This is calling the Israeli government to account for its own hypocrisy and blindness.  Despite claims that Israel is the Jewish homeland, American Jews have no control over the actions of the Israel government.  Sadly, the only way for American Jews to get out of this trap is through some distancing:  Israel should remain a country for which American Jews have a great deal of love and sympathy (like Irish-American for Ireland or Italian-Americans for Italy), but they must acknowledge that Diaspora identity can no longer depend on a shared identity with Israel.",

I have found that my education from public American high school exposed me to an even broader spectrum of opinion on the conflict than my public Canadian university. I believe that the education I received there regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was unbelievably nuanced for a high school. The article that this piece links to is extremely biased and likely represents the views of a few Newton citizens, but probably not the majority of students, teachers, or community members.  In my opinion, it's absolutely untrue that Newton high school curriculum is unequivocally anti-Semitic or anti-Israel. For instance, my school held a presentation from AIPAC one year. Although Newton has been in international news for supposedly having Qatari and Saudi Arabian ties in the curriculum, this seems a bit outrageous to me.

I've specifically thought of any support I feel is necessary for the boycott movement or my lack of condemnation for Saudi Arabia and Egypt, but I also recall my active involvement in the anti-apartheid movement and the oppression of Catholics in Northern Ireland. What I think it comes down to for me is the large voice that Israel (and in the past, South Africa and Great Britain) have had in the US political sphere. Saudi Arabia is detestable in so many ways, so they serve as a good example of a blind spot for me. But it infuriates me when anti-Israel sentiment is equated with antisemitism. Who else cries foul with this. I don't associate anti-Muslim sentiment with my distaste for the political oppression of Muslim countries carried out by their minority of small minded politicians. \n\nOne more note on fundamentalism: I can say that I dislike - generally - all fundamentalist religious practice, including those in the US. So when my fury at an orthodox man demanding the reseating of a woman next to him on a flight to Israel, it is no different, in my mind, of refusing a gay couple a cake because Jesus wouldn't do it. Or Catholic priest pedophiles. \n\nMy answer in Israel never wavers: solve Palestinian oppression. Anti-Israeli sentiment will drop in very large number.

Having already developed a very powerful sense of my identity as a Jew and Zionist at a young age, I was sometimes alienated by the universalism and progressivism of the school environment, but was neither ostracized by other students nor silenced by faculty for my beliefs.\n\nThe teachers of Fieldston's unique ethics curriculum encouraged me to express myself freely in and out of class. They taught students to be respectful of difference, and to listen to those whose ideas were out of the school's mainstream. I am very grateful to them, and to this day I try to pass their example forward.\n\nI have been following the controversy at Fieldston for the past few months, and in several lengthy articles, have not heard any mention of the ethics program. Does it still have a role in building bridges through dialogue, in awakening a moral and ethical social conscience in students? I would hope so, but through media reporting it is not in evidence.",

Not, let it be clear, opposition to the policies of Israel's governments, which is wholly legitimate, but to the existence of Israel itself.\nThe issue is theological. It goes back to the notion, from Genesis 49:10, that with the advent of the messiah, Jews lose political power. Hence, by rejecting Jesus, in Christian terminology, the Jews could no longer enjoy self-rule. This idea was reified in late Christian Roman law, which denied Jews corporate status, and which also annulled the office of Patriarch, which had existed for over three hundred years. Roman law also forbid Jews, \"honors\" like judgeship, being an officer in the army, and, most of all, the right to hold public office. The idea was repeated and reinforced by Christian legal scholars and officials, especially ecclesiastical ones, through the time of the American and French Revolutions. One can easily find these points explained in detail in scholarly books.\nOpposition to a Jewish state is a secularized (perhaps) version of this same concept. Is it \"anti-Semitism?\" Readers can decide on their own, but, for sure, it is an idea with a long history in negative religious thought. No wonder Israel is singled out as illegitimate, when so many others are not.",

But in the case of Israelis and Palestinians we have to be very careful about how we conduct academic \u201cdebate\u201d on the iteration of Zionism and even on the political acts of modern Israelis if we are to be fair. Does that mean a free pass for ghoulish Likud racists (that do in fact exist) or Settlement advocates who have little regard for the value of Palestinian lives (which also exist)?  Well, no, not really. Positive engagement with our Israeli allies in the sociopolitical realm has always been productive in working towards progress in the human relations of the region. But debate in schools or universities on this subject is a different category of dialogue. It isn\u2019t possible to establish a frame of reference for Zionism, Israel\u2019s right to exist and national prerogatives, and the relative rights and prerogatives of Palestinians, in ivory tower settings. It just isn\u2019t. Speech that targets Israeli policy vis-a-vis its neighbors inevitably slips to a debate on Zionism. It also tempts the anti-Semitic monster that \u2014 like it or not \u2014 lurks somewhere deep in the western psyche. So, as hard as it may be when one reads some of the real-time dispatches from Israel, we have to err on the side of caution in how we frame this engagement in academia or we risk tapping into millennia of imprinted bias in our Western souls.",

It is a story as old as human history, one that almost always involves winners and losers. It is clearly a reality that one\u2019s view of any one of these countless stories is subjective in regards to which group is entitled to hegemony in any particular place.

At any rate, in today's identity-based, victim culture, where history is either ignored or weaponized, it was only a matter of time before progressives turned their attention to Palestinians, who fit all the criteria to earn progressive sympathy.  That it might spill over into antisemitism is a natural outcome given that in this arena, history has been shown to repeat itself.  Criticism of the Israel state, its political and military actions and encroachment on historic Palestinian lands, antidemocratic practices in the occupied territories are legitimate issues and should be part of the dialogue.

It is, therefore it exists.  The Jewish religion has a basic problem.  It's the belief system that Israel was promised by G-d to a Jews as a homeland.  The problem is that just like every other country politics not religious virtues govern Israel. If you view Israel through the lens of the airspace its controls, the high seas it controls, the occupied land it oversees, Israel is quite a big country  with millions of disenfranchised Palestinians under their domain.  Let's face it, Israel's decision to ignore the plight of the Palestinians under it's domain falls very short of the goal set forth in our prayers that \"Israel should be a shining beacon to all nations\".  On a secular level criticizing the way a government handles it's affairs is not anti-Semitic.   There is this dichotomy of the G-d given right of Israel as a homeland, and the spirituality of Judaism which as Hillel states:  \"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.  The rest of the Torah is commentary\".  Guess what.  Young people see this spiritual rift.  Young people are leaving the Jewish faith in droves.  That's the big problem.",

It was believed, and largely still is, that Jews as individuals would be more secure in a world in which they had a seat at the United Nations table.  Moreover, there can be no question that anti-Semitism is virulent, unique and quite sadly, indomitable.  There are far worse players than Israel. That said, as a leftist, I find the whole idea of an ethno-state anathema to humanist values and, ultimately, antithetical to human progress.  To say nothing of the fact that a Jewish state must be majority Jewish, and maintaining that equation is trickier and trickier with each passing year. The crux of the problem lies in the fact that it's not unreasonable to be anti-Israel.  Indeed, from a certain perspective it's almost required.  But, for Jews, and I'm one too, Jewishness and Israel are inextricably linked.  Liberal Jews should ask themselves whether they would still support a Jewish state that is either non-democratic or even anti-democratic because that's probably where we're headed.",

But I also see here the tendancy\u00a0to reduce all criticism of Israeli policies to \"hate\", despite the usual disclaimers.I don't agree that it's inherently anti-semitic to equate Zionism with racism. Zionism posits that the land of Palestine belongs to one people, the Jews, while totally ignoring the claims of the other people who live there. If there were no Palestinians, and Palestine really were the \"desert\" described by Herzog and the Zionist movement, then Zionism would not be racist. But any theory that puts the rights of one race above those of others does have racist elements.I would urge the two rabbis, who are obviously well-intentioned, to avoid the tendency to conflate Judaism and Zionism, or Jews and Israel. Israel will only ever be accepted or rejected by people based on how its behavior accords with their values. You can't bully people into supporting Israel, or silence those who are critical of Israel, by threatening to call them racists. You need to actually fix the injustices that are driving down support for Israel among the young in America and across the West.

But I have learned over time that it is at best irresponsible over-simplification and probably is indeed (perhaps unwitting, perhaps not) anti-Semitic to validate any youthful \u201cgut-feelings\u201d students might have about perceived prerogatives and wrongs inflicted by one party on the other with a broader commentary on universal justice and injustice and existential commentary on who \u201cdeserves to be\u201d as a people and where.  When adult agitators or even adult \u201ccomplacents\u201d allow these unchecked gut-feelings to fester into questions about the propriety of Zionism or the comparative worthiness of modern Israelis than they need to removed from the debate. Would this be true if the agitating adult on campus were tweaking passions regarding vexing engagements like, say, the conflict of the Chinese and the Tibetans? No. Hypocrisy? No.",

            "comment_body": "\"Why is Israel the only country in the world whose right to exist is not just questioned but actively campaigned against?\"\n\nThis is a very good question and deserving of a long answer. I do think Israel's presence as a Jewish-majority state in the Levant fundamentally violates the worldview of certain people. From what I understand, for centuries Muslims in the Middle East acknowledged and recognized the existence of Jews and Christians in their midst but always viewed them as inferior. \n\nThis is why the establishment of Israel in 1948 came as such a shock to non-Jews but especially Muslims in the region. Much has been written about how some of the key founders of the PLO were in fact Christian (such as George Habash), but my own general impression is that Christians in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, etc. reacted far less violently overall to Israel's establishment than Arab Muslims did. \n\nSeeing a centuries-old regional hierarchy upended is never easy for anybody. Japan, long viewed by Chinese and Koreans as \"backward\" and far from the center of civilization in mainland China, emerged by the early 1900s as an indisputably more powerful and dynamic country than China or Korea--to the point where the latter got annexed by Japan in 1910. Many Chinese and Koreans have never fully come to terms with what happened at that time, but at least give them credit for acknowledging Japan's right to exist in the present day. \n\nMaybe Arab Muslims could learn from looking at East Asia as a model.",

The effect of that would be violence and death. Saying that Netanyahu is dictatorial or that settlements are immoral is neither anti-Semitic nor anti-Zionist. Learning that distinction adds import nuance to this whole debate. \n\nAt the end of the day, the levels of demonization of Israel is deeply disturbing to me as a Jew. Jews should be able to define what they consider anti-Semitism, as all other groups are able to. Those who point to far left voices who are anti-Zionist as proof that those views are not anti-Semitic (in effect) is akin to saying Clarence Thomas is not a racist (in effect) even though he believes in dismantling civil rights legislation. It just isn\u2019t believable - effect matters. \n\nWhat is believable are facts: Israel is the main focus of criticism at the UN, on campuses, and amongst liberal intellectual discourse. Make no mistake about it, the rhetoric demonizing Israel and Jews by extension is being commonplace. We see the results of that with recent attacks in New York and beyond.

This is after all the NY Times and not Breitbart. \n\nRegardless of who wins the presidency if there could be a \"ballot measure\" in a federal election limited to the illegal immigration question those opposed would win in a landslide. \n\nAs is the writer, I too am a liberal. However, the politicians in the Democratic Party are no longer \"liberals\". However, I had to learn the hard way about illegal immigration when my son was killed by an illegal alien in 2010.\n\nDespite my son's death, I would not have taken the hard-line position I have were it not for 9 years of intensive research on the issue. Of course, not every illegal alien is a murderer or rapist and neither was the man who killed my son. But we can't wait until a tragedy occurs to act.\n\nThose who say illegal aliens commit less crime than the native-born - aside from being incorrect - are saying that because they commit less crime it's okay? No it's not.\n\nThose here illegally who try to obey the law once here are enabling those who don't. We don't have sanctuary policies because there are 10 to 20,000 illegal aliens here. Look at what just happened in New York. \n\nNo illegal aliens or sanctuary policies would mean thousands of lives spared each year, tens of thousands of rapes wouldn't happen and hundreds of thousands of other crimes would never occur.

The  flood tide of these immigrants depends entirely on jobs Americans won\u2019t do for the salary on offer.\nAs long as the suppliers of jobs to uncredentialed illegal immigrants buy immunity from criminal prosecution through political power, the tsunami  of these economic immigrants can not be regulated. \nIn this labor market , demand for workers always exceeds the supply. Otherwise, the supply of workers would cease for lack of jobs on offer. The largest subgroup of total illegal immigrants are those who entered  legally on work,education, or travel visas and simply disappeared into the economy when their visas expired. \nThis is possible because Americans are opposed to secure national identity cards with unique individual biometric data. If such a warrant of personal identity existed, fraudulent employment would be much more difficult. \nSo if the immigrant is the problem, the solution is threefold. First, Universalize a  certified National identity card for all citizens, resident aliens, and illegal immigrants which would be required for legal labor in the US. \nSecond, criminalize business executives who hire illegal immigrants who lack a secure identity card. Last, congress must legislate a guest worker program that meets the labor needs of employers, regulates and supervises the importation of such workers, assures job security of guest workers, and criminalizes exploitation",

The lack of working age people is what has caused the 25-year Japanese recession. the US is on the cusp of that type of economy.  \n\nThere are only three ways to increase the workforce: 1) Have more babies (and wait 20 years (interestingly this is what Putin is trying to do in Russia after losing 10% of their population to drugs and alcohol deaths) 2) Raise the retirement age (works for awhile, but hard to get people to keep working)and 3) Immigration.\n\nGuess which is the easiest, fastest and most effective way to increase the working age population? Yep, immigration. Lots of it. We need far more immigration than we have. Indeed, by greatly restricting immigration Trump and his right wing cronies are dooming our future economy.",

People who come here illegally have no CHOICE but to take any work they can find, for any wage they can get. They are exploited, full stop.\n\nEvery article about workplace ICE raids illustrates this point. One found dozens of women doing back-breaking work at a meat packing plant for less than minimum wage.

I oppose mass deportation, but I also oppose turning a blind eye to that situation and claiming it's for their benefit. \n\nI think any American who hires undocumented workers should be charged with multiple felonies.

In 2017, Beijing, where I've live for years, had a massive crackdown on the so-called \"low-end\" population, in a cleaning-up campaign. The targets were migrant workers from poor countrysides, seeking opportunities in the country's capital. Tens of thousands were evicted from their cramped home in Beijing's outskirts, which were later demolished. Migration even inside China is not easy, since the country has the \"Hukou\" registration system that makes it difficult for people to move. Without a Beijing \"Hukou\", it is hard for a migrant to find a decent job or for children to attend public schools, and a migrant is not eligible for government benefits. Migrants come to cities regardless. They often find errand and low-skill jobs in service and food sectors (cleaning, nanny, delivery or waiting tables), or set up small businesses (convenient stores, restaurants or food stands). Despite their works are indispensable to the city, migrant workers are prejudiced as \"low-end population\" and subjected to removal. It was all too similar to what is happening in the US to the undocumented migrants. Instead of identifying sources of the problems, politicians go after the victims.",

It's all about impressions: \"So-and-so said we need to restrict immigration\" or \"Somebody said immigrants live in crowded squalor\" (breaking news: poor people have a hard time affording housing, whether immigrants or not). \n\nA better title for the article would be, \"I'm  a senior fellow at an SPLC-designated anti-immigrant hate group [true! Google it!] and I hate immigrants but want to seem reasonable about it.\" \n\nKammer uses polite language, but the only thing he condemns about Trump's demonizing of immigrants is Trump's manners, not the wall or the cages where children die. Meanwhile, he echoes the same racist tropes Trump uses. Kammer condemns Trump for calling immigrants an \"infestation,\" but then approvingly quotes Ms. Neill, who sees them as exactly that. He quotes others who worry that immigrants are \"taking American jobs,\" but really, how many Americans are clamoring to pick crops and bus tables?\n\nKammer's argument boils down to this: immigration is bad because racist Americans don't like it. It upsets people, so stop it. Which translates to: \"Keep your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free outta here.\"",

Trying to talk in any kind of reasonable way about this issue with my friends and family is close to impossible.

I don't want to vote for Trump and will not but I won't vote for anyone on the other side who doesn't address this problem in a serious way. And I think there are many people who feel the same way I do, they just aren't willing to admit to it. I am a supporter of the DACA program but that's about it. I want an immigration system like Canada's. Nobody's calling them racist. The only thing I can think as far as the dems are concerned is that they see the illegal immigrant vote as guaranteeing them power going into the future. Very cynical and very divisive.

No one says open borders specifically  but plans to decriminalize illegal border crossings, implement a fast path to citizenship, offer free healthcare and reparations (?!?) are nothing but an open borders policy.  This policy is a threat to American citizens, esp. working class people.  There is a saying, \"immigrants take the jobs American citizens are too lazy to take,\" but that was proven to be a lie by the number of Americans lining up for jobs at the Mississippi chicken processing plants in the wake of numerous ICE raids.   \n\nAlso, why are immigrant cab drivers being bailed out of their \"exploitative\" loans by the government?  Sorry, these people knew or should have known that they did not have the profile to warrant hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans.  We hear so often that reparations to the descendants of African slaves are \"divisive\" but reparations to illegal aliens at the border and to \"oppressed\" immigrant cab drivers are not divisive?  Really?",

But, more importantly, and conveniently neglected in this article, is the fact that most illegal immigration arises from overstaying visas, not illegal border crossings.  Furthermore, most people illegally entering the country are responding to poverty and political unrest that are in large measure an outcome of OUR century-long interventions in the politics of Central and South American countries.  We're reaping what we have sown in those countries.\n\nA responsible discussion of illegal immigration should include changing our foreign policies to help stabilize these counties.  Which does not mean enforcing our political and cultural values on them.  In addition, what about better enforcement of labor laws on the employers; current policy penalizes the \"little fish\" with little or no consequence to illegal employers.\n\nIn short, while this article uses some valid points to make an argument for restricting immigration, it conveniently neglects others that are equally or even more important root causes of illegal immigration.",

The author\u2019s prescription is to revisit the 1986 immigration reform with stronger workplace enforcement. This was the idea behind the 2013 bipartisan immigration reform, which was torpedoed by right wing groups like CIS.\n4. In discussing the Democratic party\u2019s evolution on immigration, the author fails to mention that the illegal immigrant population has been flat for over ten years, or the growing academic consensus that immigration has not reduced the wages of native workers.\n\nFrankly, I liked this article and am interested in reading the authors book, but it made me wonder why such a reasonable person is working at a hack tank like CIS.",

The Immigration Act passed by congress in 1790 restricted immigration to \"white\" Europeans.\n\nEver since then we have had restrictions, quotas, temporary workers and a host of enforcement systems. Only a very small minority of people support the idea of open borders. But their voice is used as a straw man to declare what most people don't want without offering a sensible alternative.\n\nOne can't reasonably talk about immigration without also talking about globalization. More specifically, when the flow of capital was restricted it had a corresponding impact on labor migration.\n\nNations were encouraged to protect their own economies and promote them. But with the free flow of capital came the inevitable increased flow of displaced workers.\n\nAn example of this is when the US dumped our government subsidized corn on the Mexican market and complexity undercut local Mexican farmers. Once driven off their farms by this \"global trade\" they migrated to the US becoming the backbone of farm labor in the southwest. But they arrived without proper documentation or legal authorization.\n\nFully 35% of current \"illegal immigrants\" simply got off a plane and overstayed their visa because they found work here that was unavailable at home.\n\nImmigrants represent an important part of our labor replacement rate. The question isn't do we need restrictions, it is how do we manage this system in the current global economy?",

Economists have examined the question and come to diametrically opposed conclusions, in many cases because of the assumptions on which their studies were based, or their extrapolation of particular populations to the US as a whole, or changes to both immigration and the workforce over several decades.  In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine examined the question [<a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/read/23550/chapter/2\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nap.edu/read/23550/chapter/2</a>] and found little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers, and that overall the inflow of foreign-born workers was a relatively minor factor in the $18 trillion US economy. Where immigration was significant was in reducing hours worked by US teenagers and prior immigrants.  \n\nNevertheless, I don't dispute that immigration reform is long overdue. In 2005, John McCain and Ted Kennedy sponsored a bipartisan reform bill that included a pathway to citizenship; it failed in the Republican majority Senate. Eight years later, in 2013, McCain was part of the 'Gang of Eight' that helped pass the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act; it passed the Democratic majority Senate 68-32 but the Republican House refused to bring it up for a vote. It's clear that the obstacle to sane policy is not Democrats, but Republicans.",

The United States should focus on strengthening existing communities among its existing citizens and building bonds of nation. Right now there is national chaos, and it is not possible to jump from national chaos to post-national unity. We are not ready for post-nationalism. Contributing to the chaos as Kammer points out, is the reality that illegal immigrants depress wages for citizens, and wages among ordinary Americans have been depressed enough as it is. Wages need to rise for ordinary workers in the U.S. not just for the CEOs with golden parachutes.

Too often it goes beyond indifference and enters the realm of outright contempt, even in liberal enclaves where people should know better. I've seen it. In fact, progressive groups are committed not only to glossing over the effects of immigration but to shouting down anyone who offers even the slightest demurral. It amazes me how so many of my progressive friends can't draw connections between the real effects of immigration and the 2016 election. They want to believe opposition is all bigotry and propaganda, while at the same time they blue-sky every single instance of migration. I'd suggest they might want to engage with restrictionists on a more tolerant basis. If we can't have a civil discussion, then only uncivil people will talk about it.",

            "comment_body": "There are some additional factors. First is the history of legalizing immigration: in the 19th century we started with no system and then passed racist legislation excluding Chinese immigrants -- excluding them as potential citizens, that is. Comprehensive immigration reform really waited for the racist 1924 Immigration Act -- embracing the quota system (people admitted by national origin based on fractions of a previous US population's national origin, racial exclusion of Asians) and dooming people from large parts of the world to exclusion or excruciating delay. Further reforms in 1965 and 1986 didn't eliminate the preferences. The other big factor is the history of our southern-southwestern border: the US started as an English settlers' republic on the eastern seaboard with a tense relationship to indigenous and enslaved people, but we rapidly expanded into territory that included new groups of natives as well as Spanish-speaking settlers. It's not so much that Latinx immigrants moved into the US as that the US moved into Latin America. The artificiality of the border we're trying to fortify is most obvious where there's no visible geographic feature defining it, though it's worth mentioning that even the Rio Grande isn't a real natural dividing line, and there was a time when the Nueces was the legal line even for Texas.",

The competitive exploitation model is of mutual benefit to all parties involved, and it is the failure of the source countries (e.g. Indonesia on the low end and India on the high end) that gives Singapore this opportunity.\nWe need to be clear about the choice we are  making. Let's be rational.\nI think the Singapore model - the ideal of American business leaders - will compound  what is already a broken social compact in the USA.

We need labor workers and that is what we get from south of our border. Our \"policy\" has long been that if you can make it here alive, you can stay. We should have long ago built a wall to say don't do it this way and a welcome center to allow true laborers to find labor jobs with a permit to work that job. They should monitor the employers so the worker will be accounted for and properly paid. We would then have a \"humane\" process, plenty of laborers, and all this should be done in conjunction with Mexico on that side of the border. The worst part about a lack of wall is if any of the poorly run governments south of our border collapse. like Venezuela or Mexico, we could have millions in our southern states in weeks. We aren't protecting Mexican or American workers and allowing a lot of people me may not want to enter. Trump is correct!",

The gutting of the American working class began in the 60s and 70s, when US business interests began outsourcing manufacturing to overseas locations so that more of the profit from these businesses could end up in the hands of a very few owners and shareholders. Before that time, the US relied on migrant labor for agriculture and service industry - very low-paying jobs that most other Americans didn't want. Fifty years later and the process that began then has become integrated into our economy. Hulks of dead factories are strung across the midwest and the skilled working class is virtually nonexistent. And the author wishes to place the blame for this on the shoulders of migrant workers, who are still doing the same jobs they did at that time, for the same wages, even though US workers still don't want to do these jobs. Remember, unemployment is at historic lows, in spite of the alleged decades of unchecked immigration. Trumpian smoke and mirrors. You want to advocate for workers? Focus on US business practices. A lack of regulation of business, the outsourcing of skilled labor for the sake of the bottom line, and the weakening of unions, not immigration, are the problem here.",

The traditional view in economics is that large scale immigration creates more consumer demand, and thus more income for merchants and manufacturers, but also expands the labor supply, thus holding down wages for the low-income Americans and for immigrants themselves.  That's the law of supply and demand at work.  The problem: it has been impossible to disentangle immigration's effect on worker income from all the other bad things happening to lower-income Americans today -- globalization, union-busting, and automation in particular.  That allows liberals to maintain that immigration is an unalloyed good while endorsing ever higher levels of immigration.  My concern, like this writer's, is that immigration contributes to both income inequality and political alienation.  As a result, I would support a reduction in annual immigration totals to about 600,000 a year, which is what the Jordan Commission proposed back in 1999.  I would also strongly support offering green cards and citizenship to illegal aliens already in this country.",

Set a wage floor by area and industry that is high enough to encourage native people to take the jobs and  encourage automation to develop higher skill more labor efficient jobs. \nIt can be done.",

There has to be a policy and it must be enforced. It also seems obvious that one primary way to regulate is to pursue the employers more severely than the illegal immigrants who are employed. I don't understand why my democratic colleagues don't agree with this. It is not hard to see that open doors is not a feasible policy. I understand that refugees need a harbor. It seems that immigration is distinct from refugees and is easily distinguishable legally and in practice.",

They earned minimum wage ($7.25 per hour), but had to kick back a portion of their wages to the contractor.  I had worked in many factories, but I had never seen so many injuries.  The quality director referred to them as monkeys.  The company was making a fortune.  As a manager, I tried to make changes, just basic changes for safety.  Who cares, was the reply. I saw Americans come in daily to apply for jobs, their applications were discarded. I was also eventually fired, for being vocal about their abuse of illegal workers.  I'm sure that company continues to make money, packaging generic drugs for Wal-Mart.  Immigration is good for the country as long as it is legal.

I believe you have set up in your arguments a false choice: between no restriction of immigration and increased restriction. What we need is effective restriction - and a lot less of it.\n\nFirst, the problems you describe with illegal immigration, i.e. downward wage pressure, overstretched social services, etc., must be seen in the context they function. Illegal immigrants create downward wage pressure because they are illegal and easy to exploit. Further, social services are overstretched because our tax system is regressive - the high earners are not paying their fair share.\n\nMind you, this is not by accident. This conflict between low-income Americans and lower-income immigrants has been set up to keep us fighting, and to allow the wealthiest to increase their benefits.\n\nOne of the reasons for so many illegal immigrants is that legal immigration is nearly impossible from several countries. If we increase and streamline (AND STILL REGULATE) legal immigration, immigrants will be on the books and cause less downward pressure on wages (especially with our current low unemployment.) If illegal immigrants are willing to pay smugglers thousands of dollars to be exploited by unscrupulous employers here, we can charge fees to recover costs of managing immigration.",

Regulations of ordinary people seeking tourism, work, health care, education , or visiting relatives  is appropriate. But that should be no more difficult than getting a passport and visa, a criminal background check, and then as easy then as getting the plane ticket. Asylum seekers  need proper treatment more desperately than any other group.\n\n Aside from criminals,  those coming to find work should be able to register easily for that opportunity and be given a chance to find work legally as a form of work tourism. Failing to get work would mean they would need to return and try again another time.  My area in Pennsylvania has thousands of good workers who evaded the complex and poorly working immigration system, yet now are contributing members of our community.  Their work supports other thousands of our citizens who ship and sell the mushrooms and crafts and other things they grow and make. They help this area thrive.

Schools, hospitals, prisons, social services, and available housing can get overrun. Many are self employed and not impoverished, but do not contribute to the tax base, fees or insurances that a legal operator has to. In the push to assimilate any and every, one hears that they are all longsuffering, hard workers and an asset. In truth many are uneducated or undereducated, unprincipled, come from countries where honesty doesn't get you very far, traumatized and have prejudices and legalisms. Where they outnumber legal citizens some utilize our systems to force conformism to their worldview. For the most part all the charm we experience from being with immigrants is with individuals and their families. Even immigrants worry about too many when the freedoms they've enjoyed are usurped by gangsters to preachers and their minions who take over and force the mores of their communities. I like variety of heritage past and present in our country, but I don't want to be the next Soviet Union.

The biggest casualty of the debate over illegal immigration in the U.S. has been the ability to discuss openly the staggering effects of population growth on critical resources such as housing, water, hospitals & schools. The Census Bureau data shows that the nation's immigrant population (legal and illegal) reached nearly 38 million in March of last year. This is the highest number in the nation's history. No nation has ever attempted to incorporate 38 million newcomers into its society. As a share of the population, one in eight U.S. residents is now an immigrant (legal and illegal), the highest level in 80 years. About one-third of immigrants are illegal aliens. Moreover, 1.5 million new immigrants (legal and illegal) continue to arrive each year. Illegal immigrants ARE draining national & state treasuries. That is a fact. It's out of control. That is a fact. To believe otherwise is simply nonsense. I hate the fact that the DP is stigmatized as the open borders/sanctuary city party. That position is political suicide. There's nothing wrong with enforcing & protecting our borders. Stop equating strong borders with xenophobic fear of newcomers. The people who cross our borders illegally are breaking the law.",

Other men came every year and returned to their families in Mexico in the winter.  Some just came for a few years.  A few ended up working as a foreman or permanent ranch hand year-round.  Those men often brought their families and settled permanently.  Some saved enough money to return and open a business in Mexico.

My immigrant colleagues were every bit as skilled as I, and they were paid accordingly.  They were hired for their skills, diligence, reliability, & the pride they took in their work.  They were productive & law-abiding members of their communities and took care of their families.  I don't disagree with many of the points Mr. Kammer makes in his commentary.

In later years, I owned a mfg. business, and sponsored several immigrants in getting their green cards.  Why on earth should it take 10 years for your priority date to come up?  Why on earth, once you finally have been admitted, do your wife & children have to wait 5 more years before they can join you?  These are 2 examples of situations I have personally witnessed.  I think these inhumane policies play a big part in driving illegal immigration.

This practice is affecting greatly the quality of education in our country since most of these immigrants do not challenge students to avoid conflict and get their work visas renewed. It is time us liberals speak up and not allow conservatives to claim it is us who want open immigration. Illegal immigrants are breaking our laws and those who do not enforce the law lack integrity as well.",

We need immigrants to not only maintain the population and economic vitality but also as sources of new ideas.  We should welcome those who come legally and that try to fit in at least a little bit.  The same goes for the DACA people.  And, just from a practical viewpoint, it's hard to get 11 million illegal immigrants to leave, so I think they should be put on the path to citizenship if they learn English, etc. But, we just can't take everyone either from a logistical viewpoint or from a maintaining social stability viewpoint.  That's not right or left, it's just common sense.  If we could take everyone, we should then open the doors and house everyone in our own houses.  People don't do this because it's not economical, practical or enjoyable.\n\n    So, let's:\n\n1. Speed up the legal immigration process, so people don't need to wait 10 years for a green card, \n2. Have strong border enforcement (no walls, though) like any country and like how we lock the doors of our houses.\n3. Regulate the flow of immigrants so it doesn't hurt our own workers and so that the immigrants we do welcome have the time to assimilate.  \n4. Additionally, encourage all immigrants to at least try to learn the language (when in Rome, do as the Romans do) and mostly assimilate, while retaining the best parts of their previous country's cultures.",

Finally how many corporations are going to give up on using cheap, immigrant labour?",

I agree with the proposed Republican restriction of family immigration.

But,immigration should be increased to a level that will spur our economy without raising unemployment. Refugees and asylum seekers should be first in line.",

Protection of unfortunate immigrants from exploitation while they try to escape other horrors.\n\nUnfortunately the statesmanship required to balance and sort these issues is in short supply today.\n\nMore US citizens might try immigration.  For my family it was a challenge.  My wife and  I left  the USA with an 11 and 13 year old, liquidated our assets and moved to a foreign country.

Remove the conditions that create an exploitable labor force.  Stop deportations.  Let the market actually sort out labor, and the government's role should just be to ensure that employers don't discriminate on the basis of national origin or anything else, that employers pay everyone the wage they deserve.

Those who are against that will never vote for Trump.   Each and every one of the Democratic hopefuls espouses the ideals you mention, so choosing among them must be based on who, if in office, can best undo the damage.  And that comes down to ideas.",

I didn't notice any right-wing media attacks on him.  There were some benign observations of his lack of experience just as there were of Trump.  Carson fell back only when the debates revealed he didn't articulate clear objectives as well as Trump did.  To my knowledge Trump never poked fun at him the way he did Jeb Bush and others.\n\nI've lived in a southern state for 65 years, and I've crossed paths with genuine, hard core racists and white nationalists.  These people are shockingly ignorant.   They usually live sad, isolated lives and also hate any form of government to such an extent that most don't vote at all.  Their children leave home early in embarrassed resentment. Fortunately they are dwindling in number.\n\nAll you accomplish by hawking racist memes is to poison the minds and dash the dreams of young African-Americans who, like all children, envision themselves capable of wondrous achievements.  Surely you don't do that to your own children?  What parent would undermine their own child's hopes by telling them the cards are stacked against them no matter what they do?",

And your argument that values and ideals are what will motivate a majority to vote for the Democratic candidate is right on target. However, your own moral absolutism is almost as bad as Sanders' and Warren's social and economic \"absolutism.\" To turn away from voters who voted for Trump because they may be racist or xenophobic is to lose an opportunity for the Democratic candidate to summon the better angels of these people. We should not let them be defined and dismissed by the worst presidential candidate they ever voted for.

Yet despite this, Trump\u2019s  opposition continues to promote that Trump has suspicious ties with Russia.

(Or totally New info to Fox News watchers cult!)  Go the high road with Ideals --- but do not overlook Trump horrors in doing so. GOP gets this.  When will Dem hire Professionals who also do??!!",

Why can't we just leave things as they are? Life is pretty good, no?\n\nBut surprise: Obama brought out their Mr. Hyde personality; Dr. Jekyll was pushed aside.

In their minds, it's their Christian responsibility. And they shall not abandon their values, beliefs, traditions, and history, so help them God.\n\nOthers, of course, are more nuanced: \"We just want a safe, prosperous America, but minorities and repulsive sex practices prevent that. We must get right with the Lord. It's the right thing to do.\"\n\nAs such, it's a religious war in all but name: the good guys vs. the bad guys. Cowboy up or hippie down.

This wasn't a terrible thing, because it allowed the government to address important tasks.

That make sense - it IS a means. But the presidency should probably be more of a symbolic post than it is at the moment.  A Donald Trump should not be allowed to walk into the White House and burn the place down.\n\nMr. Blow is right - we need a visionary. Obama ticked that box. The reality of governance tempered the vision he laid out for us, but at least he told us what he was trying for, and made an effort.\n\nThis is why Sanders is a good counter to Trump, probably more than the other candidates.

It is not too often in politics that we see a candidate attack not only his opponent, but his opponent's supporters as well. FDR famously said of the financial interests arrayed against him that \"they hate me, and I welcome their hatred.\" It was in effect a declaration of war. \n\nTrump and his supporters have in essence declared war on common decency and have assaulted the rule of law. Early in the Trump presidency many of us were engaged in soliciting the concerns of Trump's followers. We sought to understand and empathize with their reasons for being so disaffected. But we soon came to learn that for far too many of them, there was no reasoning. There was no reciprocity. They have gone far beyond their initial desire to shake things up in Washington. Their nihilism can only be seen now as an endangerment to the rest of us as it gives their proxies license to trample upon traditions and break the law.\n\nThose of us who see the peril and know the urgency of this time can take heart in remembering that Hillary Clinton had three-million more votes than Trump. There are more of us than there are of them. We must rally our side to action. As Lincoln told the people of his day, we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our nation. We need a fighter, someone who will blast Trump to his face and take him down. Someone who can be heard by all to say, at long last sir, have you no decency?",

Yes. But, one day before this nightmare of a culture war is over, someone will have to be bold enough to step over enemy lines and figure out how to mend the gaping wounds in American life. \n\nSome candidates are kowtowing when they do this.

We thought, hopefully,  Obama would be the new normal in a post-racial society, but now the former president is perversely blamed for being too timid, too traditional, thus opening up a space for Trump's radical right-wing, narrow-minded MAGA-ism.  \nMaybe it's just inevitable tension between Yin and Yang, or those progressives who favor utopia over the distopians. At some point, the human character behind the voices infuses the policies, as with Lincoln, TR and FDR, and loom larger than any debate platform.",

Vengeful voters go the polls seeking to correct a perceived injustice. Whether you are a diehard Bernie fan or a MAGA maniac, persons in either camp are \"woke\" to the fact that a vote for one is a vote to cancel another. I can't count the numbers of times I have heard previously tepid Trump supporters who are fed up with elitist liberalism say they will walk on broken glass to reelect Trump. Likewise, most Trump-haters would probably vote for a chimpanzee before reelecting the president. This  malappropriate and vengeful usage of our voting rights is hardly unusual or unexpected. What distinguishes vengeful voting during this election is its degree and that it almost certainly hinges on the perception of personality as opposed to policies alone. It detracts attention and energy away from issues by seeking to punish a candidate and his support faction. \n\nBitterness at the polls is best dispelled with a measure of kindness and respect among the candidates. Democratic candidates would do well to craft messages that are inclusive and respectful of GOP voters and, as much as possible, their key concerns and issues.",

Democrats need to convince Trump voters of 2016 to switch, or to get non-voters to turn out to expel Trump.  These people are not highly-principled voters in the sense that Blow means, or they would have voted against Trump in 2016.  Opinions on the \"social\" issues will not easily be changed.  The main chance that Democrats have not just to beat Trump but to get majorities sufficient for real reform is to get people \"on their side\" on economic issues.  They should be proposing things that do benefit most people economically, and pointing out how Trump and Republicans have been actually harming them.  Principles on \"social\" matters should not be abandoned, but fighting things out on the grounds chosen by Republicans is not the way to victory and reform.",

Where is what you write going to be seen by the people who most need to see? \n\nMitch McConnell has decided what Congress will and won't consider as law. He has made himself dictator of Congress and is proud enough and confident enough to announce same publicly. Consequences? Nada.\n\nThe beliefs of Trump's supporters is the problem, Charles. They want what Trump represents to them -- a snub in the eye of traditional governance. He spits on people and they love it. The only way to stop that is for the media (mostly on air) to have a way to counter FOX et al. They don't.\n\nWhen a reported says \"untruth\" or \"falsehood\" or \"unfounded statement\" instead of lie, the populace loses.  Why? The networks need to keep viewers and won't risk the stronger word. Alternate facts are lies. Trump is a liar. Bernie Sanders is the only person who says it straight out. McConnell is a despot. Bad combination. The Dems are just bad at pushing back.\n\nHow do you shift the values of millions of people? No one really knows but war comes to mind. Scary.",

Those of color need to be reminded that it was whites as well who fought and died for their rights and that racists are just haters and cowards who will always find an excuse to express their hatred, regardless of race or gender. Haters like Trump need to be defeated objectively, not by calling them racists. That behavior brings them down to the level of haters. I'm afraid it's too late for Democrats to make a correction.

Vengeful voters go the polls seeking to correct a perceived injustice. Whether you are a diehard Bernie fan or a MAGA maniac, persons in either camp are \"woke\" to the fact that a vote for one is a vote to cancel another. I can't count the numbers of times I have heard previously tepid Trump supporters who are fed up with elitist liberalism say they will walk on broken glass to reelect Trump. Likewise, most Trump-haters would probably vote for a chimpanzee before reelecting the president. This  malappropriate and vengeful usage of our voting rights is hardly unusual or unexpected. What distinguishes vengeful voting during this election is its degree and that it almost certainly hinges on the perception of personality as opposed to policies alone. It detracts attention and energy away from issues by seeking to punish a candidate and his support faction. \n\nBitterness at the polls is best dispelled with a measure of kindness and respect among the candidates. Democratic candidates would do well to craft messages that are inclusive and respectful of GOP voters and, as much as possible, their key concerns and issues.",

Exploited they have to the max from offering free health care to illegals to crowing about the new minority-majority which is itself a lie to ignoring working-class concerns. Mind you the working class has always been one of the cornerstones of the Democratic party. Why one would want to alienate them has to be the most idiotic political decisions of all time. This strategy has handcuffed the party. They're unable to react in real-time to issues that concern all voters for fear of alienating their now identitarian base. The biggest question implied but not answered in this article is can Democratic Moderates & progressives co-exist in the same party. I would say absolutely not. The voters we need to win back the country have different values. There's no way to bridge the gap. If any of the far-left candidates are the nominees in 2020 we will lose decisively.",

Should we have a president who has bragged about assaulting women, paid off women who claim to have been sexually involved with him and been accused by multiple women of being sexually inappropriate with them? Should America have a racist in the White House?\"\n\nThe questions are closer to: should abortion be legal?  Should government and taxes be small?  Should we have a bigger, stronger military?  Should we close our borders to non-Americans entering our country illegally and focus our resources on current citizens, some who are suffering?  Should the government force an American citizen to buy something they don't want (health insurance)?\n\nThe former are all things Trump is likely guilty of to varying degrees.  The second are questions people disagree on.  on which I would side with President Obama and most Democrats.  Many Americans will side with Donald Trump.\n\nWhy use the language of CNN and Fox?  Why use language that ends the conversation with those other Americans that disagree with you about the latter questions?  Should we only converse with those that agree with us?",

If they feel marginalized and disenfranchised by the coastal liberal elites, the will identify with Trump.\n\nTrump knows this, and plays to it. His true values have nothing to do with those of his supporters. What he values are only things which benefit him personally. But he sells himself to 63 million voters in America by farcically adopting their values in his rallies and communications, though not in practice.\n\nIt is all a sham, intended to dupe America, dependent on finding voters who are all too willing to lay back and let him have his way with them. They are the ones who are at fault, abetting a malignant narcissist  in his self-enrichment schemes and the rending of historic American values.

Have you ever given any thought to why this great country of ours, the United States of America, has a broad swath in its middle called the Rust Belt? The fact that we have a region so named might provide some insight to the mood of the millions of Americans who live there. In many comments I\u2019ve posted in the past I often use the phrase \u201cthe Rust Belt formerly known as the industrial Midwest\u201d. I\u2019ll get to my point. I agree that this country still has a percentage of the population who are racist, sexist and xenophobic. But the vast majority of Americans, I sincerely believe, do not carry those types of hostilities within. Which brings me back to the Rust Belt...the part of the country which will have a very big say in who is elected POTUS in 2020. If the Democrats want to have a shot at winning the presidential race, their candidates better start talking more about the economy, job training and job creation. Americans, irrespective of color, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, or country of origin still have to get up in the morning and figure out how to pay the bills; improve their family\u2019s quality of life; to make things better for their children and grandchildren. If the Democrats focus on these things and stop calling out people as racist and sexist, they may have a chance at beating Donald Trump.",

While I agree that there are many voters who are repelled by Trump's modus operandi and lack of decency, and that their votes will be motivated by those feelings, it's also true that Trump's base will ignore that and be equally motivated to keep him in office.  Putting ideals first will, indeed, will propel anti-Trumpers to the polls, but ideas, too, do and will continue to play a role in their antipathy. They are not mutually exclusive but, rather, reinforce each other. \n\nWhat makes Trump's opposition so cohesive and their convictions so firm is the duality of their own biases, which motivate them as well. Trump's supporters share different ideals, as well as different ideas about the role of government, and that does and will keep them in line.\n\nIt's still too early to handicap this race. Pundits and pollsters tried to do it in 2016 and were roundly trounced by the election results. Ultimately, the outcome shocked many on both sides, and the results were balanced on the precipice of a few strategic counties scattered across only a few states. The majority of voters was not, however, decidedly convinced that Trump was The One.\n\nWhat is clear is that none of the Democrats candidates has yet convinced a sufficient number of voters not only that they have what it takes, but that they have a clearly communicated vision. \n\nPeople do know Trump. He controls the board and also has an incumbent's advantage. That's huge.",

Instead of specific policies I believe that the candidates should be articulating their vision for the kind of country they would like to live in. It is far more Important to know that a person will govern with a certain vision than to know in advance what the policies will be. Whoever wins will be handed a pretty daunting task just restoring some of the ideals we have lost over the last three or four years. As far as things like universal health insurance or child care or housing, the details have to be hashed out amongst all the stakeholders. The person leading this process has to have an open and generous heart and an ability to take in and process a lot of conflicting information and then to lead the way to solutions. Coming in with a ready made plan is a rigid approach and will not work. I often see the pledge of allegiance posted with reference to the phrase \"under God\" emphasized when the proper line to highlight is \"with liberty and justice for ALL.\" It's the ALL part the conservatives willfully ignore. Maybe if they would read their bibles a little more closely they would realize that GOD is for everybody, not just certain people. As the Buddhists say, until all sentient beings achieve enlightenment my personal enlightenment is incomplete.  So they take a vow to help all sentient beings on the path.

For instance, the statement that Chevron and Amazon paid NO taxes really hit me this time, in a way it did not before.  Teaching is about repeating, that is how we learn.  I thought this debate succeeded because every candidate is on the same page, for the most part, educating the electorate, via repetition, about economic inequity and other topics.  The incumbent does not have this forum.  Now of course, many of those who actually watch debates may be least in need of education on the topics, but certainly not all.\n\nAnd what was stressed at the end of the debate is what I think could be key:  that America needs to return to ethics and morality that is in concert with who we believe we are as citizens of this country.  This leapfrogs other topics that people can be on one side or the other of.  Because there is not a \u2018no\u2019 answer to this.

Making sure Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t spend another 4 years in the WH has to be foremost in their minds, and they need to keep talking about saving the ACA.  Those 2 items are the most important.",

Words matter. Our biases, fears, and hatreds live within words. But our highest ideals and hopes do to. To Mr. Blow's point, let's talk about the values of tolerance, justice, the common good, compassion for those who are trully in need, and those ideals so beautifully expressed in the United States Declaration of Independance.  \n\nPolitical objectives need to be solidly framed within a framework of high values. Obama's power and charisma came from his ability to speak in terms of American and human values rather than wonky policy. Bernie is persuasive to so many because he speaks in terms of values. Likewise for Warren.\n\nOf course, knowing all this, charlatans appeal to values but the results of their legislative actions show that their real intent was not to serve the common good but to serve only the powerful and wealthy.\n\nWhen spoken of with honesty and courage,  values are powerful. It's a power that can unite a people.",

By talking about climate change and its opportunities for a green New Deal with high-paying jobs, and by emphasizing that a graying country needs immigrants, we can appeal to the more pragmatic among the Trump 2016 voters. By appealing to decency on behalf of Dreamers and other immigrants, and by emphasizing the melting pot, regardless of when, from where, if, and how, our ancestors arrived, we can plant the seed to heal the divisions that Trump has reopened. We need to emphasize that it\u2019s time to root out systemic racism, and to end the outrageous amount of income inequality that Republicans have caused. And, yes, we have to stop ignoring the rural poor.\n\nIn short, we need to show that we are not \u201celites,\u201d even though we believe in education. We, instead, understand our roots as working people and want to join hands with others so that people aren\u2019t left behind. In short, we don\u2019t have to embrace racism (God forbid) to appeal to people who work hard to put food on the table. Democrats always do best when we work for everyone who is striving to move forward.",

Elizabeth Warren's comprehensive plan to implement universal childcare for ALL children while raising the qualifications and WAGES of early childhood educators (an essential part of making this work!) is a game changer for all women, children, and families.  Her commitment to paid parental leave for both men and women will also change lives.  Finally, women will have the support they need to be in the work force and men will have the opportunity to care for their children with equal commitment. Let's hope that both women and men realize the importance of this long overdue opportunity for transformational change and vote her into office!",

But to Warren, her friend and colleague just declared that he doesn't think she can achieve her goals because she's a woman.  That's the kind of thing you remember.  Every woman has moments like this with 'woke' male friends, because no matter how woke he is, for a man feminism is only ever academic.  For us, it's personal.\n\nBernie could have said he doesn't remember saying it, apologized, and moved on.  'I don't remember it' is the strongest denial he should make, in the absence of a tape recording.  He could even have skipped the apology!  Instead he claimed it never happened.  The corollary to that is that Warren is lying.

But she lacks those great lines  that come so naturally to Mayor Pete, snd were thehallmarks of John F. Kennedy 's and Barack Obama's campaigns. And if you're on the other side-- Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan could spout them, too.. Most Americans dont vote with their minds but with their guts and emotions and with their probably warped ideas of who a President is and how he--so far all he's-- makes them feel. I guess I'm no exception .",

Women are the ones who lash out, who get emotional, and lie about the men in their lives. Right fellas? We know how crazy they get...\"(wink, wink, nudge, nudge) \n\nAngry white male, who deems any question of his purity as the emotional faults of his female accuser. \"I'm the arbiter of my character, because that's my white male privilege.\"\n\n\nLook, IF Sanders made a tactical, strategic comment, then say so! And if that was the context in which the Warren team heard it, they should be saying so! \n\nIf the comment was a strategic one, then there is no there, there. Stating a strategic reality in a political race, that a woman cant beat Trump, again, is not a sexist comment. Its a strategic comment, based on a whole host of factors. Not the least of which is past performance. \n\nNow IF, the comment was made in a non-strategic context...and Warren's side can prove it...then do so! Otherwise its hearsay and doing nothing but pitting like against like, and undermining public confidence in the Dems. Which is lousy strategy...\n\nWhich is normal for Dems, bad strategy.",

Many states have punitively strict abortion laws ready to trigger the moment Roe vs Wade is overturned, which could happen this summer, thanks in part to women like Susan Collins and her fellow female Republican Senators voting with the good old boys (who would never give them a seat at the table) to confirm Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court Justice.

Women's progressive rights have stalled, stagnated, and women are in danger of losing many of the rights we fought so long for.\nAt 74 I certainly would like to see a qualified, intelligent woman elected President, but given the current political climate, I have my doubts that is possible.

Hillary Clinton didn't just lose the Presidency, we lost our country's soul that night, and I do not know if it can be redeemed at this point.  So right now I am not focused on a female getting elected, I am focused on Trump being defeated,",

The politicians, economists, business leaders who put such trade deals together have a delicate job of satisfying all constituencies that have the power to block a deal, and they're forced to push it through the weakest spot in the opposition.  Or it won't get done at all - as in fact the TPP didn't get through.  Left out are the powerless losers - the workers who'll be put out of jobs - precisely because their concerns DON'T have to be met in order to get the thing done.  \"We'll worry about them afterward,\" the planners say to themselves, but they don't and can't - it's just too hard.  And so, eventually, the losers vote for some demagogue who promises to address their concerns, although the result is mainly rhetorical - but at least they were, finally, heard.\nIt's the same logic as when the sewage or power plant, the garbage dump, the polution zone, gets built in the poor, often black, neighborhood.  All the other neighborhoods have the power to block the deal, and so it goes to the only one that can't fight back, the powerless one.  Thats how things get done.  And even after the powerless vote for someone who voices their concerns, he doesn't do much to meet their needs - politically, it's just too hard.",

Scolding people for not sticking with the tried and true beltway bureaucracy while their communities are crumbling is why HRC lost four years ago.

Some of us remember reports of hacking of social media and dirty tricks to keep voters from voting. 77,000 isn't much of a margin.\nWe haven't protected ourselves against those very much.  Or other things that could explain the 77,000.\n\nIf we're talking about women, let's talk about mail ballots and men, especially men who like Strong Men candidates. (Remember Alex Jones secretly voting  his estranged wife's mail ballot?)  Mail ballots make voter coercion within the household if Big Daddy or Big Brother rule. The 'secret' in 'secret ballot' can be hard to keep. Compare voting in a booth at a public polling place: it's private.  That makes vote buying harder, too.\n\nOne other ignored factor is hacking of voting machines and tabulation software.  Imagine that the hacking was in the tabulations:  Imagine software that detected that the actual numbers gave the hackers' choice less electoral votes than he needed, then figured out which states could change that result, and added a few more votes, 5, say, to his total in every precinct.  (Would such a minor discrepancy in precinct numbers be noticed?) For example, Pennsylvania had about 9700 precincts. DJT carried PA by 44K votes which is less than 5 x 9700.  \n\nAre voting machines and tabulation software any more secure this year?",

Yet Trump was able to beat Hillary  in spite of obvious ethical and moral flaws in his background. The Access Hollywood tapes stand out in my mind because the public factored them out.  This is where the gender bias is most evident. Had a  woman been caught in a scandal as Trump was, that would have been a campaign show stopper.  The message for women for the near future is that they are surely electable, and can beat a male opponent but they are held to a higher standard to overcome the gender bias that remains today.  Fifty years ago, they were probably not electable. Fifty years from now, the playing field should be level. At least one hopes so.",

There was no preparation for what that would actually mean (duties, protocol, etc.) - Clinton never spoke about that aspect. And because the FH would have been hound-dog William Jefferson Clinton, there was a strange, slightly creepy wild-card aspect to it. I don't think people thought about this consciously, but I do think it influenced their hesitation to vote for Hillary. In other words, it was not just \"A Woman President\" it was also that there would be an FH, and he would be an ex-president.",

More striking, other surveys have revealed that the EXPECTATION that men will be the sole or primary earner is even higher than 70% among straight women, and higher still among upper middle class women.  As long as men are expected to be the sole or primary earner, as long as boys are raised with the expectation they WILL be earners, while girls are raised with an understanding they MIGHT be earners, women will not be considered equally committed to the workplace.  How many men do you know who are asked \"Will you continue to work when the baby comes?\"  None.  Because men are not given such a choice.  Their reward? Long hours in a cubicle, shortened life spans, and little time for parenting.  The ridiculous narrative that women have been denied opportunities to work equally are just that: ridiculous.  How many men might prefer to work less and parent more?  Plenty.  If women want equality in employment and politics, the answer is clear: Stop considering financial dependence on men a status option, assume you are equally responsible for earning, assume men are equally responsible for parenting, and parity will occur.",

She could be a fantastic president.\nBut I\u2019m not pleased with the way she is casting herself as aggrieved by Bernie Sanders.\nThe scripted call by the Sanders campaign, which describes Warren\u2019s supporters as being too exclusive a group to win, may or may not prove correct.  However, it was not badmouthing and it was not dirty politics.  The offense she expresses is disproportionate to what happened.\nThen there is the he said/she said narrative about whether Sanders told her, in 2018, that a woman can\u2019t win.  If he really said that, and if she really took umbrage at him, why did she wait until now to say it?  The timing with his surge in Iowa seems more than a little coincidental.\nAnd Warren\u2019s pointed refusal to shake hands with Sanders at Wednesday\u2019s debate looked flat out petty.\nThis woman believes that a woman candidate can beat Trump this year.  But to do so, she can\u2019t keep presenting herself as a victim.  You can be sure that Trump is going to be a lot more vicious than any man running in the Democratic primaries.",

If you want to talk about timing, how about asking why Sanders didn't run for President against the neo-liberal establishment until a woman was the nominee? Hillary Clinton was no corrupt politician in bed with Wall Street - she had been the Senator from NY and so of course she had friends from Wall street, but she certainly was no more beholden to them than Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. \nIf he was willing to defer to Warren (as he said) in 2016, how come he didn't decide to throw his weight behind her in 2020? Warren's election in 2012, in stark contrast to the losses Democrats sustained all over the country at that time,  was what galvanized the liberal wing of the Democrats, a fact that Sanders seems to be acknowledging in saying he would have deferred to her running. But now, he wants to take the credit for seizing the moment - which happened to be at the expense of another female candidate.",

Looks like Warren/CNN even tried to trip up Bernie after the debate with a hot mic, after she refused Bernies handshake.  Looks like Warren seeing her campaign plummet is angling to be Bidens VP.\n\nThis is what really happened, but certain media are desperately trying to spin the story against Bernie. The same Bernie that wanted Warren to run in 2016 instead of himself.\n\n\u201cTwo people with knowledge of the conversation at the 2018 dinner at Warren\u2019s home told The Washington Post that Warren brought up the issue by asking Sanders whether he believed a woman could win. One of the people with knowledge of the conversation said Sanders did not say a woman couldn\u2019t win but rather that Trump would use nefarious tactics against the Democratic nominee.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could,\u201d Sanders said in the statement. \u201cDo I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016.\u201d",

What is more striking is that for such an accusation to have any traction at all with the voters, it implicitly requires that vast portions of the electorate must, at some level, have latent concerns about electing a female President. Perhaps Sanders did suggest to Warren that America hasn't matured enough to elect a female president precisely because of this observation. However, I doubt that Sanders would have made such an observation cheerfully if he did so at all.  \n\nBut times are rapidly changing. In the not too distant future, it is not difficult to imagine that gender discrimination will fade completely. Tonight, the first female MLB baseball coach - Alyssa Nakken - has been hired by the San Francisco Giants. If baseball can end gender discrimination then I believe the voters can too.",

Unless it was a strategy to secure women's vote.\n\nBy mentioning her brothers from Oklahoma are Republican it seems she is frustrated that her own siblings are probably not going to vote in the primary and may not be voting for her in the general must be frustrating but she needs to know that families in the USA are divided along party lines but they should unite on other issues or just getting through lives. \n\nThe Spat matters also for the democratic party that there are candidates who are power hungry and will do anything to get ahead.\n\nSanders looked flabbergasted and very much a grumpy old man, when talking to Warren after she refused to shake his hand.

A look at the funding maps showing  shows that such an arrangement balances the ticket geographically if not ideologically.  As for ideological balance, despite the wistful pundits, there is not much moderate middle remaining in the US and those that are still  there lack the passion and energy to get out enough votes to win a close election (as the 2020 one is likely to be).  That reality is reflected in the mediocore quality of the remaining moderates in the presidential race.

When everything is a commodity and judged based on its dollar value, we learn to view the world entirely through a lens of self-interest. As an old co-worker put it, he didn't have a kid in school, so he shouldn't have to pay for schools. This from a CPA with an MBA -- a smart guy who was oh, so dumb. So the question we now approach life with is \"what's in it for me?\"  The question becomes a slippery slope of moral degradation: why should I have to pay for someone else's schooling, or health care, or housing, or food? Or pay for these things for an immigrant? Or for someone who worships a different god? \n\nWe've come a long way from the civic virtues encapsulated in \"Ask what you can do for your country.\"",

No one else cares.\" \n\n\u201cWe have a moral responsibility to end childhood poverty in America,\u201d says Democrat/socialist presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders attached an amendment to a Senate bill \u201ccalling on President Barack Obama to submit a five-year plan to reduce the childhood poverty rate in the United States, which is greater than in any other major country.\n\nSince the early 1970s, we haven\u2019t even tried to prevent child poverty. During the Obama administration, spending on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Social Security analog to prevent poverty among families with children, continued its long-term general decline and today is well below $40 billion.\n\nAmerican children are just as deserving as senior citizens to live without battling debilitating poverty. But not in the eyes of leaders, Democrat or Republican. Sanders is doing a great service to publicize this neglected crisis.",

And kids are being taught younger and younger that only money really matters in life.

Each child is brought up on the belief that each one is the best. This creates a trophy self-image that wants and expects a trophy life. It creates an emotionally challenged brain. So every relationship ends up being emotionally challenged including with children. \n\nEmotional health (EH) is the foundation of health and yet we have no testing or manual for EH. Mind and brain that are two separate entities are lumped together as just the mind. As a result, we have cutting edge mind education while brain education is ignored and the brain is even miseducated. EH is the function of the brain and as brain education is messed up so is EH. \n\nNo wonder while civilization that is a function of mind education is advancing; the social ills as bad as ever. If we are to improve all-round relationships, including with children we will have to create EH/brain-education. Brain education is wise parenting for young and brain therapy for the rest.\n\nWisdom is the smoke where EH is the fire. Therefore EH education is even more essential if we are going to change from an emotionally challenged country into an emotional health superpower. \n\nI have a formula for wisdom that has applications in education, health, and society. It even creates a whole new wisdom industry.

I guess single adults are supposed to starve or rely upon the kindness of others if they are hungry, out of work, and have no money.\n\nIn America children are property.  There is a long tradition of that in America.  It's why we don't step in when parents abuse their children physically or mentally or both. There are countries that forbid spanking or corporal punishment of children.  Maybe they know something we don't.  \n\nIn America women who kill their abusers in self defense are charged with murder.  But if women are afraid of being killed by their abusers the police don't take it seriously.  The same goes for children who are abused, molested, etc.  \n\nIn short, in America, it's not only children who are hated.  The handicapped, women, seniors, the poor, people who must work for a living, anyone who cannot find a job, etc.  The people/entities our government (and we by extension because we elect our politicians) treat the best are the richest who have the resources to flatter, bribe, and manipulate to get what they want at our expense.

The benefits are supported by so much research that it seems like a no brainier. I would also add that childcare being available onsite for employees is another family support that has significant benefits for both employee and employer. Employees miss less work and are more productive. I realize this isn't a government program but employers could receive incentives for such programs. These simple programs improve family life so significantly, which that in itself will create happier children. Our children are obviously hurting, as youth suicide rate demonstrates.\n\nThe information you cited regarding school lunches is something I haven't given much thought about and I thank you for sharing. Healthy eating starts in childhood. Maybe we can then get US life expectancy to increase rather decrease, which is a huge issue given we are a developed country. \n\nAs for the change in public assistance, i believe that program was an easy target for people to blame for our debt when in reality corporate fraud cost Americans much more annually then welfare. \n\nThanks again for m bringing light to these issues prior to election.

A lack of good jobs means lacking the means to move for a better one.  It means financial insecurity in high cost areas, resulting in increased evictions, food insecurity, poor diets as people rely on cheap processed food.    Our \"right to birth\" political party - the Republicans- would pooh-pooh this.  People in low wage jobs are there because of their own personal failures to \"pull themselves up by their bootstraps\" - not due to greed and inability to pay for education and/or training to qualify for a better job.  Yes, some people make poor decisions, but many decisions are made based on immediate needs.  Many poor, working class people do not have the luxury those in well paying jobs have - in that they can more easily move between jobs, live in a school district with good schools and afford health care -just to name a few things.  We have failed many of our citizens by adopting the trickle down theory for the last 50 years.  We have only to look around to see it hasn't worked very well for many.",

In my view, the US will never be able to mature as a nation or as a people until it abandons the Old Testament as its moral cornerstone and adopts the New Testament or something else. I don't expect that to happen until the nation completely implodes in every sense, which should happen well before the end of the century at this rate.",

The list goes on-and-on (healthcare, proliferation of guns, growing wealth disparity, etc, etc, etc), and to this parent, it's depressing to know what I'm doing to my daughter and all the other kids in her class.  When I was a kid, my parent's generation tried to make society better over time.  My generation has failed to live-up to that model, and we now live in an era where the cheaters who win reap the rewards, and the truth-brokers who don't win are disregarded.",

In particular, I have been bothered by the buzz over free college and drastic revamping of how college debt is managed (though the latter does need attention) when the real need in the United States is for massive strengthening of early education, including higher pay for those who teach our children as well as an overhaul of the curriculum so that future generations know how to find and assess information better than current generations do.

The county commissioners in Cottonwood County, Lutherans, and Mennonites who believed in helping their fellow men, increased what the county would give in benefits.  This would seem like a good thing, but what happened is, it drew females to the county, especially females that a number of children by different males, but were no longer in a relationship with a male, or had one who was working but living with a man while collecting benefits.  Often, their children needed a lot of services, mental health care, juvenile detention, Boy's ranches, etc.  These were all white females.  The county you are in, is the one the pays for all of these services.  One family could cost the county, easily a quarter of a million dollars, or more.  Did these services help get these families back on track as functioning members of society, not really!  This ushered in the era of pregnant females in high school setting up their own household at the expense of the county, state, and federal government.  After 45 years of welfare, Head start, free school lunches etc., academic failure is at a record high in Minnesota, and across the country.

Notably, I am white, married and was then over age 30. \n\nAfter my child was born and I was preparing to return to work, I learned that childcare in this country is a \"your-on-your-own\" situation. Even now, a generation later, it remains nearly impossible to find affordable, full-day childcare, even for parents with a steady income. And as for safety, well, again, you're on your own; regulation and enforcement of childcare standards are haphazard at best. This massive failure surely impacts children of color even more severely than white children, but it is toxic to all, and deeply corrosive to American society. By contrast, many other countries value and support children and their families. In Spain, for example, children can start public school at age 3. From Europe, to Korea, to Israel, and so many other developed nations, providing meaningful support to children and their families is considered essential to their societies, and is treated accordingly.

British attitudes have become much better attuned to reality since then, although there is constant push-back from the Thatcherite right, and current social supports for children are a shadow of what they were from World War II to the Thatcher era.  Even in the 1880s there was plenty of evidence that the poor are the way they are because they are poor, not the converse.  It was ignored then, and it is still being ignored now.",

Like the US, women in Japan increasingly opt for a professional life in their youth and like the US now outnumber men at many universities, and like the US the expected work ethic of professionals leaves little time for an involved personal life, for men or women. \n\nThis seems to be a symptom of first world nations in general. Even in the much vaunted EU where maternity leave is more common, birth rates are low and/or declining among native populations, and immigration is seen as a vital need to maintain the population.\n\nSo while I don't oppose maternity leave as a policy, I don't see it as a solution to the problem of low birth rates. It has not solved the problem in Europe or anywhere else, because the simple fact is that women in developed countries increasingly do not want to have children. The natural consequence of this is either a shrinking population, and a collapse of the welfare system that depends on a growing tax base, or mass immigration that will bring unprecedented cultural changes to this nation and others.",

Why does America find lower/middle class women and children \"less than\" others? \n\nBecause there is family leave, on-site day care, day care subsidies, flex time, telework, etc... for those who work in the corporate world and federal government agencies. Working Mother magazine releases a list of their top 100 companies who offer all of the things above... the chart (albeit from 2017) gives a full breakdown. There may not be a huge push for these as a universal benefit, because those families already have what is theirs... and lets face it, they are majority of the voting constituency since they have the money and political leverage. \n\nAs for the federal gov... there is on-site day care, or remote affiliated day care, for civilians and military members. Many of them have been long established even before corporate America caught on. Examples: Langley Day Care at the CIA  has been around since 1989, and the one at the NSA since 1992. The Pentagon had accommodations prior to the 9/11 attacks. About a year ago, the House opened their own day care... the Senate has had one. The list continues, as well as the Child Care Subsidy Program for those who are on the lower-mid GS pay scale. Flextime and telework is available for most employees, so working parents definitely take advantage of that to schedule their days accordingly. \n\nOnly if it was easy to bridge the gap!",

But equal or even more? Tha'ts wrong. The childless don't get paid work leave. But they very often have to pick up the slack of the parent having to leave work early,or when the parents go on leave, and then come back to their jobs.  No extra income for those left behind...\n\nYou wanna have kids, great. Just dont expect the rest of us to subsidize you for doing what is likely the results of your apathy. \"Oops, honey guess what...? Im pregnant...again....\" \n\nI jest...a little, but there are issues here that need to be dealt with. Namely, parental leave demands the offering of an equal perk for the childless. Only fair. Those left behind to pickup the slack of those absentee employees, need to be compensated. And if child-care is paid by an employer, then the childless need some sort of extra benefit as well. Maybe by paying less for equal health insurance. \n\nThis is the problem this nation is having...we're caught up trying to micro-managing every gap and \"injustice\".  Instead of truly aiming for more egalitarianism in all aspects of our lives.\n\nEveryone wants benefits and special treatment, just not for everyone else.",

And the value of the meals provided is nothing short of remarkable. Many schools also have food pantries and other programs going the extra mile to ensure disadvantaged kids have meals in addition to what they get at school.

Sadly she suspended her campaign due to the derision of her as being \u2018out there\u2019 because, I believe, her message of spirituality being misinterpreted and seemingly not part of typical political messaging. But she speaks truth.

In Europe, they've seen how quickly people can drop from comfortable to needy and want to be sure there is protection.\n\nThe second is that social programs in Europe - child care, health coverage, retirement payments - are for everybody, at the same basic levels. No one thinks it's just for the \"other\", it's for everybody. That's why social security is not ever seriously threatened, it's for everybody. Any proposal to limit payments to wealthy people is a way to put it on the road to elimination. We have to give child care credits to people who are comfortable, as well as those in need, not based on different criteria for different groups. Then it can get and stay popular.",

It seems to originate in early episodes of \"The Simpsons.\"\nContrast these sick scenarios with the culture I experienced in the Sixties and Seventies in Atlanta, Georgia, where as a child I walked to piano lessons unescorted and was safe; where respectful neighbors did not stalk one another; where music-making on all sorts of instruments was allowed and appreciated, and where there was a teaching mother in many homes while the children were young.\nCivility?",

This constant unwarranted attacks on Bernie by MSM are becoming transparent because they are so numerous. We got it. Corporate America really does not want him as president.

He doesn't get the air time to talk about anything else. Because the MSM are on the mission to prove that is impossible, that does not have support, etc. But it does have support. Who would not want to have guaranteed health care regardless of changing jobs without all the administrative hassle. Would I rather pay $300 a month more in taxes than $500 a month to my private health insurance for the same product? Profit margins of private insurers increased from 2.4% to 3.3% in 2018. Hospital profits increased 43% since 2011 (while they treated nly 12% more patients). Big Pharma has a profit margin of 20% on revenues of close to $800B. Yet our life expectancy is DROPPING.

And while most reading this think of Families of Color when this subject is discussed, primarily White communities with limited economic opportunities noted in the article demonstrate the same phenomena given the same conditions. \n\nChildhood is the place where, in just economic terms, our attention and budgets should be placed.   \n\n.",

Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden because they discovered sex and had too many children.  Two sons represented a doubling in the population and to rectify this Cain killed Abel.\n\nEver since, wars have been necessary to kill off the excess children.  Of course parents didn't see it that way.  My children will succeed, they said.\n\nBut too many children took up room in the Garden.  At first this led to hunger, but technology came to the rescue.  People learned to produce food more efficiently.\n\nThe population grew.  By 1798, when Malthus wrote his essay on population growth, world population was a little under a billion.\n\nThen the Age of Enlightenment gave birth to the Industrial Age and population growth began in earnest.\n\nIn 1968 Ehrlich wrote the Population Bomb, which warned us that continued population growth was unsustainable.  World population stood at 3.5 billion.  It has more than doubled since then.\n\nNow we have every presidential candidate proclaiming the need to fight global warming.  None of them point out that the most important step is cutting population growth to zero.\n\nInstead they echo Krugman's view that encouraging smaller family size is \"racism.\"\n\nThe result is that population growth increases the yearly use of fossil fuels even as we make prodigious efforts to shift to solar power.",

Private education is marginal, limited to English speaking schools mainly for expats. Starting school before 3 years old is heavily encouraged, as children then make friends before their parents' biases influence them. \nThere is a constant pressure from all voters to improve the whole education system.\n\nAnd investing in children does pay for itself. The most advanced societies achieve economic performance through high employability of their workforce, a result of investment in education and healthcare. That's why the Nordics can achieve full employment despite high labor costs, high taxes etc. \nSome of the European resistance to low educated immigration, resulting in far right victories, was/is rooted in this.\n\nIt would be interesting to analyze the ways in which the US compensates for the poor output of its system.

Underspending relative to adults was evident across the income spectrum for all the rhetoric about pampering our young. \n\nThat pattern may explain why the US never developed the child support systems one can find in other wealthy countries and that Prof. Krugman cites. It also suggests that addressing this myopic pattern of underinvesting in our young will require social, not just political change.\n\nWe have underinvested in our young for decades and cannot just blame the problem on a particular candidate, President or party. We can only acknowledge our past mistakes and strive to do better in the future at all levels from the household to the Federal government.\n\nGreta Thornberg has suggested a good place to start investing in and for our young: really combatting the cl,imate change they will inherit from us.",

Creative, multiple playgrounds.  Wonderful swimming pools for children and adults.  Subsidized quality preschools.  Healthy eating habits and many outdoor markets with daily fresh fruits and vegetables , generous childbirth benefits and vacation time that allow families to take the kids on frequent trips to interesting places, and the most priceless of all - National Health Care.\n\nIt is very hard to have a grandson a half a world away.

Mothers are also elibile for unemployment insurance during their absence from work, or the Qu\u00e9bec Parental Insurance Plan, whereby up to 75% of income benefits are paid to support the income of a female employee on leave. If you are the father of a newborn, you are entitled to five consecutive weeks of paternity leave without pay.\n\nDental: Dental care is free for children under age 10.\n\nDaycare: Daily fees at a subsidized daycare start at $7.55 a day (per child) and are available to all Quebecers regardless of income. \n\nEducation: Affordable tuition (for college and university).\n\nAmericans need to shed the notion that \u201csocial democracy\u201d is a bad thing.",

The other problem was money: Universal Pre-K involved the provision of space and the hiring of staff all of whom would be paid for by taxpayers--- most of whom had no children at home. Needless to say, this resulted in pushback from voters who would need to approve more spending.

Even the kids the programs are supposed to help (eg free lunch) feel they are getting a handout, and it is of lesser value to them. In addition, let's face it- people aren't the most altruistic so they don't want to help \"other\" children, and end up supporting ending/reducing programs they they feel aren't helping themselves too. When the US finally gives all the same programs/incentives/etc to all children, I think we will see a big difference-- see for example how popular Social Security and Medicare are.",

In fact children in america are more likely to be born today to the poorest americans who struggle with low paid jobs, high housing costs and  nonexistent child care facilities. \n\nThat children are more likely to be born into poverty in America is central to the lack of attention they are getting. While upper income groups have not had to struggle with child related costs, middle and lower income groups have found that the costs needed to raise a child are quickly exceeded a lack of wage growth. Children born into families struggling to survive not only perform less well in school but also have poorer physical and mental heath. \n\nClearly the lack of discussion of the plight of children is due to our reluctance to discuss the maldistribution of income that allows for lower income groups to fall below the wage level that would allow them to have decent housing, nutrition , health care and after school care. In speaking of children we need to accept that we are speaking of raising the minimum wage, improving subsidized housing, nutrition and child care facilities. We are speaking also of raising money...in short raising taxes...and maybe this is why they are not an election year issue...the reluctance to speak of raising taxes !",

Precisely because what our CULTURE calls a \"good job\" is defined in a purely pecuniary way, whereas we are human beings, with not only material but also emotional, mental and spiritual needs. Create an economy where most of those needs are NOT being met at all (quite on the contrary), and where even your salary isn't guaranteed, in the long run, and then people become anxious and want those who do not \"work hard\" to suffer MORE, not less, because if not, it hurts their sense of justice.\n\nWe have to redefine \"work\" to solve this problem.

The idea of government-funded and government-run social services does NOT square with the capitalist ideas born from \"rugged individualism\" that make America great. As with everything, for childcare as well as for healthcare, there is the \"normal, day-to-day\" activity (and expense) and the abnormal/catastrophic activity (and expense). In my view, it is OK to expect the government to play a role in addressing the abnormal/catastrophic expenses because that stuff cannot possibly be taken care of by individuals. But, the normal, day-to-day expenses need to be taken care of by individuals themselves (or, their community-based charitable organizations)",

Mentors change as well for these kids.  Once they are 18 they could be put in their own apartment in a building with other wards.  They all steal from each other because they get $200 per month for food, phone bill and necessities. There is no counseling or even an adult in these buildings.\nWhen they age out an employee comes to deliver their last check.  Very little is said.

Brilliantly laid out, no doubt.   Thank you.\n\nHowever, America, at least from my 60 year old perspective, HAS attempted to help America's children, but, that help created a disaster.\n\nPrior to the 1968 legislation pushed by LBJ, who, did have good intentions, which introduced \"Aid For Dependent Children\", the number of children born to single mothers was fairly small.   Surely, one way children have good nutrition is to have a cohesive family unit (in my case with both parents working so we can afford good food).\n\nIf you look at any graph, today, of the number of children born to single mothers, you cannot help but be struck by the post 1968 exponential rise in those numbers.    \n\nAid for dependent children had a component that CAUSED this problem.   Women with children could only get money IF, and, only IF, they were single.\n\nSo, as in any experiment where a reward is proffered to a mammal, the mammal sought the reward by adhering to the reward rules.\n\nWomen became pregnant with intent to collect the money, and, remained unmarried and not working.   \n\nNow?  We have a huge monetary commitment to children that our own legislation CREATED.\n\nHow do we fix that?   Well, cutting off the money to children will not make you happy right?  \n\nSo, what now Mr. Krugman??  What is the solution proposal?",

Such unfavorable conditions are too manifold to list here. But, when summarized, they all boil down to the fact that the people in the environment are too wrapped up in their own neuroses to be able to love the child, or even to conceive of him as the particular individual he is; their attitudes toward him are determined by their own neurotic needs and responses.\" (Neurosis and Human Growth, p. 18.)",

Their husbands were tired of the scene after working a full day, one in a school, the other in a hospital lab.

That America's children from poor families live no better than children in third worls countries is both tragic and outrageous--in the supposedly wealthiest country in the world.\n\nLove Paul Krugman, but do not agree with his statement \"at least part of the blame rests with Bernie Sanders, who made Medicare for All both a progressive purity test and a bright shiny object chased by the news media at the expense of other policies that could greatly improve American lives\".  \n\nDoesn't the news media determine what stories they will tell, and how they'll tell it?  In fact none of the Democratic candidates made the welfare of children a primary talking point, and none of the media present brought the question up.\n\nThanks to Paul Krugman for drawing attention to this heart breaking issue--just wish his colleagues would jump on board.

Of course, we should hope against a world war, because that would be Armageddon.  But we may well be looking at an imminent Depression the way the US president is handling the economy.  The Dow has risen 10,000 points (50%) in just three years.  Is anyone else nervous that things could collapse, and sooner rather than later?  Trump is motivated solely by his own self-serving interests, but a \"silver lining\" consequence of his actions, actions that will lead to economic calamity, will be to spur people on to activism the likes of which we haven't seen for over half a century.\n\nThe People will not get what they need until they are willing to again rise up and be taken seriously.

I doubt any of the Democratic candidates have even hear of it, but  at least showed some awareness of how little money early education teachers make even in highly expensive not for profit preschools.  It is one thing to say you for all for universal pre-K, it is another to  have well developed pedagogies  to implement.  But problems for children in the US go well beyond early childhood education, child care, and paid family leave.  Children have the highest poverty rates than any other age group much higher than older Americans, many have limited health care and dental care if any especially important here is the lack of  prenatal care.  Many young children are victims of trauma and abuse both directly and indirectly via spouse abuse.  I could go on and on.  Democrats talk a good talk but it is very general and they mainly talk of children in terms of the future (while Republicans care only for children before they are born not after) for example the environment the will inherit and their access to higher education (all worthy goals).

Imagine a child placed before a TV as a pacifier or babysitter. There are some educational programs, but consider how a child watches years of cartoons only to become a middle aged coach potato watching the \"Simpsons\". Just imagine what that means in terms of intellectual maturity. Where are the books of education, or philosophy and history, the civics lessons from basic law to social education? Children must not spend their most formative years being exposed to immature themes. They go on later to never become greats like Jefferson, Adams, Washington, or Lincoln. Where are the greats anymore? They are confined by fears of cartoon weaned viewers averse to intellectual conduct who have forced our society into decline and conflict.

Most people believed that adults shouldn\u2019t have kids until they really were ready and able to take proper care of them. The catch phrase was \u201cfamily planning\u201d  but people didn\u2019t need a catch phrase to understand the ethics and responsibilities involved with having kids.

Some seriously illegal things were happening - forcing the leader of Head Start (a truly dedicated person) to quit.   \n\nThe Head Start program was moved again - with even lower enrollment numbers.

It's hard to blame that on the GOP.\n\nThe bigger answer to the question of why we haven't been talking about children is that our society values neither children nor adults.  European social democracies (aka \"socialist countries\") continue to provide healthcare, parental leave, living wages, collective bargaining, higher education, and housing to all.  The real question is, Why can't we do the same?\"",

Europe - \"Most advanced countries devote substantial sums to benefits for families with children ...\" Liberals love to point out higher European social spending. But they forget that Europe also has much flatter taxes than in the US.  In France which Krugman uses to illustrate, the main source of tax is a flat VAT (sales tax) of 20%.  Krugman also highlights Social Security and Medicare - but he neglects to mention that these programs include payroll taxes (flat like the VAT).  In fact, Democrats haven't asked for on additional dollar from the poor and middle class since Medicare fifty years ago.  The problem is simply that Americans simply do not want to pay broadly higher taxes in exchange for more government services.  (For example, see the election losses in liberal VT and CO involving single payer health care in exchange for broad tax increases.)\n\n2. Those People - I share Krugman's interest in helping children.  But the aversion to doing so is not racial.  Half of welfare recipients are white.  If the issue were race, wouldn't voters favor spending on poor whites ? Moreover, if the issue really is about helping children (of all races), shouldn't Krugman be focused on promoting marriage which has been repeatedly shown to produce better outcomes in children.\n<a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/07/single-motherhood-worse-for-children.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/07/single-motherhood-worse-for-children.html</a>",

When children go hungry they aren\u2019t just experiencing empty stomachs. Think of how you feel around 11:00 am awaiting lunch and your blood sugar plummets. For children who skip a meal or two a day the consequences can be dire. Childhood hunger can result in illness and behavioral difficulties in adulthood, even leading eventually to criminal behavior. This is from Harvard pediatricians who study the subject. The cost of cutting aid to children in terms of paying later for medical treatment from chronic medical conditions in adulthood, having to implement further social programs as triage later in life due to early deprivation, or in the worst case, expenditure for prison time, is vast \u2013 far more than any program to deliver proper nourishment. Cutting aid to needy children and families in essence constitutes fiscal malpractice, and is downright mean-spirited in a Dickensian way. On top of that, studies show malnutrition and poverty in a single generation can have impact for several, literally becoming encoded in a line of DNA, perpetuating dysfunction.

Outside of missile defense and cyber security, my opinion is that we shouldn't be otherwise putting money into Europe's defense. Let Europe shore up and spend on their own armies. So there is 12 billion dollars a year for paying for maternity leave. Just step 1.",

Maintenance of infrastructure was scorned as government waste. While Nixon began the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, under him 2/3 of government spending went for treatment with 1/3 for enforcement.

They are relative to historic experiences (try doing Nazi salutes in Germany) and current circumstances (tiny Singapore has compulsory land acquisitions to survive). Think what apocalyptic climate change will do to human rights and free speech when survival of mankind is at stake.\n2. Democracy is good, all else is bad and there is nothing in between. There is a huge difference between popularity and competence. Winning the popular vote will not give you competent governance. It is so puzzling why the US refuses to see this. It even thought introduce democracy to Iraq and all problems will be gone!\nRecall the famous Chinese saying? Cross a river by feeling for the stones. This is open-mindedness.

That's how empires collapse.  Other countries don't put a blade into the reigning power, that power cuts it's own throat and slowly bleeds out.  The US aren't the good guys anymore.  We are just as morally bankrupt as any other country on the planet.  We have been invading countries and occupying others nations since the end of WWII without let.  The lying, the cheating, the entitlement, the utter disregard for common decency, civility, and rule of law  runs from the top to the bottom and moves in all direction.  This guys talks about China's surveillance and control of it's citizens, but what do you think this country is doing?  How is standing in line at the airport waiting to have your privacy violated any different than what the Chinese do, or allowing law enforcement to scan though millions of surveillance photos with no oversight?  And that's just the tip of the irreversible assault on our supposed freedoms.  When our economy collapses, and it will, we're not going to recover.  The only real gains from the last economic catastrophe were made by the rich. The middle class was hammered, and the poor were ignored.  The average American is drowning in a debt that they will take to their graves.  China won because they tried to improve their society, not exploit it to ruination.",

The elevator ride to the top had passed through a hotel too extravagant for me to afford.\n\nYes, there is still lots of poverty in China, but compare with India.

Its foreign policy, at least in principle, is to respect the sovereignty and history of other states. Most importantly, it is a growing and necessary counterweight to abusive American power. The US' growing failure is due both to inherent flaws in its fundamental ideology and its failure to manage the inequality and political/social tensions that have resulted from its economic and racial inequalities. The radical neoliberal philosophy that governs the US is slowly killing it but the fanatical devotion of its political class to NL remains intact. Even more, the American right wing is defined by its hatred of foreigners - both at home and outside the US. Abusing and bullying people whom you hate and fear is not hard. Now, with Trump, the Republican base's hatred and contempt for everyone who is not American has been given full expression. In the face of all of this, the US deserves to stagnate.

While there was a direct computer link from Trump Tower to the Russians during the election, and Trump has tried to repeatedly arrange secret meetings with the Russians, all of that is actually no longer necessary, as by now Trump knows exactly what the Russians want him to do.

When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957, the US responded with the National Defense Education Act and the School Mathematics Study Group, both of which helped in my education as a computer scientist. Today, we meet China's growth in the sciences with complaints that their knowledge is 'stolen' and by strong-arming countries around the world not to buy technology from Huawei and ZTE. \n\nThe comparison between the New York subway system and those of Beijing, Nanjing, or Kunming, is simply astonishing. We invest nothing in our nation's infrastructure. The US scores low in measures of educational achievement <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/15/u-s-students-internationally-math-science/ft_17-02-14_stem_table\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/15/u-s-students-internationally-math-science/ft_17-02-14_stem_table</a>/\n\nThe problem has been many years in the making. It can't be blamed only on Trump. Many Americans equate strength with military might, not with education and infrastructure. The result is that the US is coasting while China moves ahead. Change will happen when Americans care enough about making the needed investment to elect a congress that will pass appropriate legislation. \n\nPart of the problem is that Americans know little about China. It's a wonderful place to visit and it's possible to get bargain airfares. Consider China for your next vacation.",

Invaded Korea where China easily pushed American troops back to the 38th parallel and stopped.\n\n2.   Invaded Vietnam, where Ho Chi Minh, with a bunch of teenagers, easily pushed American troops out.\n\n3.   Invaded Afghanistan, where the Taliban has easily prevailed every day since, while we have ensured a mass diaspora wrought by destruction.\n\n4.    Invaded Iraq based on the Weapons of Mass Destruction Lie, and, destroyed every old, beautiful city there creating yet another huge human diaspora...which has destabilized Europe.\n\nIn the meantime China is:\n\n1.   Establishing relationships by building infrastructure in many major countries.  Not destroying infrastructure like us but building infrastructure.    \n\n2.    Building high speed rail infrastructure within China to enable mass transportation of people and goods.  Not hiways that will never be maintained properly like us.\n\n3.    Managing education for children so that, well, children can add, read, and are multilingual.\n\nSure, China is  Authoritarian.  Minority populations have challenges just like the minority populations in the USA.\n\nI say:   Maybe it will be good if China overtakes the US?   More peaceful.  More infrastructure.   Less war.   Less destruction.\n\nHow about you?",

There are three major issues in China that Leonhardt's Op-Ed provides a solid context.\n\nFirst, Nanjing might be the best place to understand the big themes of modern Chinese history: from being the Sick Man of Asia to reclaiming their proper place. China is not seeking global domination but to be slotted into the global order that reflects their standing in the world. As the dominant power, the U.S. must get this right. The alternative for a constructive China is a destructive one. From Iran to North Korea, China's cooperation is essential.\n\nSecond, there is a great big race between the Chinese Communist  Party and the Chinese Civil Society. The big question is: can the CCP evolve and grow its capacity to manage the Chinese population as that population becomes wealthier, more educated, and more global and cosmopolitan?  How long will ordinary Chinese citizens tolerate their inability to choose the leaders of their government when they make free choices in other parts of their lives? \n\nThird, China has already become a mature, capitalist economy. Even as U.S. is working out tariffs against Chinese imports, China is already a service-driven, consumption-based, high technology economy. The United States should not fear Chinese exports--rather, we need to focus on accessing the Chinese market. This means that we need to view China differently. Much like the CCP, we too must evolve.",

The Democrats never propose to actually make them prosperous ... just dole, dole, reap votes, and dole some more.\n\n150 years ago the government was still giving away a very valuable thing: land. It gave to those would could, and would, develop it. Today we do essentially nothing similar.\nIts all private capitalism. \n\nChina does ... it gives opportunities and perks to those who develop it, and they get rich.\n\nIn terms of what we need, countering China's putative power, we NEED ti rich and super rich.

My first contact with China was in the early 1990s. At that time, China had little foreign exchange and real-world knowledge. They came to us and asked for advice on how to grow. Should they follow the U.S. example? I told them no, that they should follow the Japanese example. Remember when Japan was known for cheap radios? They made a lot of foreign exchange with those and moved up the development ladder. They decided to follow our advice. They went from buying second hand equipment because it was all they could afford to where they now buy only the best because they can afford it. Focus, dedication, eyes on the prize, not individually but as a nation. When was the last time the American population pulled together as a nation? Not in 2011, because that was more a knee jerk reaction to a horrible experience. I would say it was during Y2K. Shortly after that began the steady, public rise of the Investment Bankers, presaged by Mr. Milken. Now, every American, for themselves, wanted to be a millionaire, the heck with the nation. Americans eagerly sold and taught China and gave away our knowledge and industries. And so ... Trump. Don't blame China for our choices, learn from them now.",

We all need a changed mindset that moves from excessive production and consumption of things to a better social life for all. \n\nIn the age of Xi, Boris, and Trump this is hard to imagine. They are goons looking at things the wrong way and unwilling to understand the human condition.\n\nThink of it -- parents just want their children to grow up safe and smart and happy. There are better ways to accomplish this than by continuing barbaric practices inherited from our past that justified inhumanity in the name of growth and innovation. Do we really need to talk to our light bulbs?  Do we really need to buy bigger cars and buy them more frequently? Do we need home entrances that rise to the heavens and consume fossil fuels to heat and cool the sky? \n\nBoth China and the US (and others as well) should first get a handle on what we should become before we kill each other to become what we might dread.",

While many U.S. undergrads in college seem to resent and/or blow off homework or tests as getting in the way of their social life and sports, Chinese students in the same classrooms are diligent and appear to center their studies.  For many U.S. students, being serious about studying is de-emphasized, starting before college. Serious students are seen in unflattering ways (e.g., bumper sticker: My kid beat up your honor student).  If this represents students in each system, the U.S. education system has its work cut out. \n\nFor too long, politicians on both sides have played ideological football with the education system.  Making sure the textbooks convey a certain ideology (Texas standards, conservatives) or centering self-esteem over content (liberals) have both been wasteful strategies, to give just two examples.  Decrying the education system as corrupt (both conservatives and liberals) is not a winning strategy. Where the system is weak, we need to strengthen it, not denigrate it.\n\nWe need a new culture that centers challenge in learning and excellence.  There's a precedent historically.  How about a post-Sputnik type effort in education from both parties? Make sure our students are the best, as they once were.  We have a common competitor, just like post-Sputnik.",

Mr Leonhardt is certainly right to emphasize that in terms of competition between the US and China, the US is its own worst enemy, and what the US needs to focus on is getting its own house in order, something that can only be accomplished of Americans have the clear-sightedness and will to elect a Democratic president and Congress. But it's also important that Americans recognize a CCP-ruled China as the global threat it is, inimical to basic universal values of democracy, human rights and freedom, and this means also that at home and abroad, the US government has to emphasize and promote those values. In turn, this means the government and Americans in general have to look up and gain a greater global perspective. The US, for being the center of the world, can seem a very provincial place at times, with a penchant for navel-gazing, the fixation on Trump being the most recent example of this. Trump is a symptom, not the disease itself. The disease is in the body politic. Put that right and there's no question but that the US will 'out-perform' China, which actually now has many more problems than this article suggests.",

But another fact is China's historical tendency towards....for lack of a better way of saying this....a navel - read here belly button - gazing power.  \n\nBy this I mean that the Middle Kingdom sees itself as the center of all things and, as a consequence, tends to develop an inward focus.  Being arguably the inventor of the Bureaucratic State, a highly centralized top-down, governing style, it has always tended to limit their ability, indeed their desire, to pursue the more exploratory and aggressive strategies of the West.  The structure has been a strength, and a flaw.  \n\nAnd while they may evince differences from their earlier incarnations even so, underneath the Kabuki mask of the CCP this is still their essence today.  They are still a top-down extremely hierarchical society.  Xi's defacto claim to the role of Emperor in the form of ruler for life  is the proof of this.  \n\nAnd for them this might be okay.  It's a system that's worked for well on two thousand years; so why fix something that clearly isn't broken?  This might be their societal viewpoint.\n\nBut how they will fit themselves within the context of the modern economic system will be interesting to see.  If nothing else America now has a competitor worthy of consideration. And to address it she certainly needs to get her house in order.\n\nJohn~\nAmerican Net'Zen",

Even if America wasn't stagnating, China would still be an ascending economic power.\n\nHere's why; China's biggest advantage isn't American stagnation, it's the fact it's the largest consumer market on the entire planet. Every company that has any aspirations of being a global powerhouse in their respective industry MUST have a presence in China. That gives China tremendous leverage which is why companies are willing to concede technical knowledge, or even ignore whatever values they may have about free speech, or human rights. \n\nThe second advantage is China's authoritarian government doesn't tolerate a lot of dissent. When it comes to plans to implement national policy or government programs once something is decided it gets done. There is no partisan bickering or horse trading. That's why the country is able to implement high speed rail, and highway, bridge, and tunnel projects with breakneck speed. If one looks at a list of infrastructure in terms of the longest bridges and tunnels, a significant number of those projects are Chinese and they have been done in the last 20 years. In America we can't even decide what needs to be done or how to do it.",

But I think it's be a mistake for focus on the decline of American power.  Rather we should focus on improving America, in particular making the American economy work for most, ideally all,  Americans rather than for a few billionaires.  Most of our current woes derive from the wrong turns taken under Reagan in terms of unionization, taxation, government subsidy of business, cuts in science and education funding, the phase out of heath care and pension benefits, deregulation, privatization anti-trust, and numerous other political policy choices.  None of these are market forces but rather are political choices.  At a remove of 40 years from Reagan we need to ask ourselves how these political choices have worked out for America and for almost all Americans and their families.  The unavoidable answer is disastrously so let's reverse and change course.  The magic sauce of America's mixed capitalist economy has always been the initiative, willingness to work hard and take reasonable risks and community spirit of the American people.  We can't compete with China's top down elite directed control of the entire economy nor should we want to.  Reinvigorate America's economy and the relative power balance will resolve itself.  Continue on our current course and it won't be long before our economy will be unable to support American power projection.",

For many, the inflection point in our nations slide backwards occurred in 1980. That is when the Reagan revolution was born and began its methodical destruction of our government, the courts and the American dream for so many. \n\nReagan's words have guided Republicans, in their zeal to deregulate markets, privatize govt., defund people programs, while increasing corporate welfare, and advancing destructive neoliberal policies. \n\n\"In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem .\" R. Reagan, 1981, inaugural address.\n\nIn short, the Reagan revolution has given the American people: the biggest transfer of wealth from the many to the few in history, failing infrastructure, failing schools, a healthcare system that destroys families, and endless wars.\n\nBut wait there's more! The Reagan revolution created the Federalist Society, a group of lawyers that has been quietly packing the courts with Republican and Christian right ideologues, and the Justice Dept. with people like Bill Barr. Trump is not an aberration, he is one of the many negative outcomes of the Reagan revolution.\n\nThat said, China trudges forward and the US slides backwards on its way to join Russia as kleptocracy that exploits its people and serves the oligarchs.",

For the so-called \"well-educated\" New York Times readership, I suggest reading \"The Hundred-year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America As the Global Superpower\" by Michael Pillsbury, a China expert who served several US Presidents. One theme explicit in Pillsbury's book is how since the Nixon era, the United States has facilitated China's goal of global dominance to gain an ally then against the former Soviet Union, to play the Cold War superpowers off each other to gain geopolitical advantage, which proved to be an acceptable strategy until the fall of the USSR, leaving China as the power in the East. Then the strategy backfired in China's favor, not to mention concessions made to China in terms of technology transfer during the Clinton administration and beyond. Had HRC been elected President, America would have kowtowed to China in every possible way. Finally America, under Donald J. Trump, has a president who is willing to stand up to China, and attempt to curtail its attempt to replace the USA as the world's superpower, despite push back from the Establishment. I hope in the name of patriotism and nationalism, Americans will be patient as the tariffs  combined with Trumpian trade policy, will level the playing field and restore American economic global hegemony.

War has been a chief cause, because of the vast resources that have been diverted from investment at home in order to fight enemies overseas.

Let us not forget the current battle with demons, the opioid crisis, that has sapped resources widely throughout the US.\n\nWhat China has that I wish we had is a vision for the future.  Agreed that China is still totalitarian, but at least there is a plan.  Our political leaders are caught up in the present, and some pander to the past.  We cannot compete with countries that are willing to invest more in the future by sacrificing now.",

The construction of these clean modern buildings were meant to stimulate the economy perhaps to the point of over reach,  as they stood empty for years, but also as an investment in future growth.\n\nThe Chines as in most civilizations seek status and a comfortable life style which to them includes a nice place to live and as my guide told me an SUV which to me gave me visions of 100s of millions new gas guzzlers with the concomitant pollution which we now see in many chinese cities.  \n\nBut China has not dropped out of the Paris accords and has taken steps to deal with its pollution.  It has a plan that has lifted it out of the desolation of its own revolution and its subjugation to the western powers of the 19th century. Whether that plan which includes high tech and more moderate growth will make it 'better' then the US is not the issue.  Rather it is whether China can be brought more clearly into the international community as a partner rather than as an adversary.",

The Chinese are benefiting from simple and fundamental cultural values, e.g. a work ethic, an education ethic, a respect between generations, relative freedom from drugs.  In the last few decades they have had a half way enlightened government that understands what causes humans to devote their efforts to improving the productivity of the society.  Xi also seems to be attempting to suppress the inevitable corruption associated with human and corporate greed.  So far the Chinese population is buying the package.  The real question is can their 'one party' system continue sufficient self correction to sustain these traits and results, or will they go off the rails with Tiannamen Square like massacres or foreign stupidities like building fake islands in the South China Sea or grabbing territory.  \nA two party democratic system is obviously no guarantee of automatic self correction that avoids criminal stupidity, at least in the foreign relations sector, e.g. Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq wars.  On the plus side, the multi party democracies have  so far avoided Tiannamen Square like massacres.  Unfortunately a two party democratic system doesn't seem to have too much to do with sustaining healthy work ethics, valuing real education for all,  encouraging intergenerational respect, and preventing individual and corporate greed from producing gross distortions in the financial and political sectors.",

The government provides a vast centralized education bureaucracy that provides a strong basic education for all students through high school.  it is harshly competitive for access to better schools as students progress through middle and high school into university. For those with less academic interests there are vocational tracks.  Most good students take classes after school, and both days on weekends, in English, math, science and Chinese.  There is NO emphasis on competitive school sports in the Chinese system.  \n\nThe culture is geared to prepare students to be the brains and leaders of a world led by China. If you live in Beijing, and understand the education system, you will also understand the enormous pride students feel for their country, on the leading edge of what they see is a world that is Eurasian, no longer centered on the United States.  \n\nCurrently, the value students see in the US is university education. That is changing as more good Chinese universities gain international reputations and graduate research programs.",

Due to the one child policy, China's working age population will see a drastic increase at the same time it's over 65 age will explode. Demographers predict by 2040 China will have twice as many elder people as children under the age of 15. No country in history has turned as gray this fast. To make matters worse, the one child policy resulted in mass - and often forced - abortions, typically of females. As such, China will have to cope with tens of millions of surplus men who have no prospect of marrying, having children, or carrying on their bloodline. A rising generation of increasingly forced urbanized Chinese youth (mostly men), who have no siblings, no spouse, no aunts, and no uncles will shatter China's 2,500 year old reliance on tight familial networks. \n\nThe economy is propped up to a large degree by a government aware that if its fortunes take a slight downturn, they will have to deal with millions of disenfranchised individuals. Its why the army mostly points inwards as opposed to outwards. Its why ghost cities are built with no inhabitants. Its why megaprojects are undertaken with little regard for their final outcome.

The reason Marxism takes root in China and becomes Socialism with Chinese characteristics is because it meshes well with Chinese values and philosophy.

I can only assume they were selected for the \"reality TV\" demographic, as Ms Hasslbeck was.  I'd have more respect for them if they backpacked across America sans trust funds.  \nBut the problems don't lie solely with them.  Ms Hostin's constant refrain \"I don't understand\" is just as insulting.  She does understand, and lacks the courage to say so. \nThe other two are classic \"broads\" who speak their minds unapologetically.  But Joy Behar was my limit, introducing a subject she knew nothing about (for shame, teacher).\nI assume BW is rolling her eyes with the rest of us.  I can't bring myself to believe she would have signed off on this dumpster-fire.\nBy all means, give us all the views - just make them informed ones.

Nevertheless, I was  supportive of her being on the show when her tenure began: the show is what it is because it's a forum of contrasting ideas.  We all have our ideology. However, continuing to adhere to  positions that are only defined by our ideology is both unwise and in these fraught times,  dangerous.  If someone just sees things through one lens, it confirms that that person is close-minded and unwilling to listen and learn.  It also limits one's receptivity to good ideas that may not receive oxygen in the bubble of one's ideology.  In addition, if all of us continue to stick to our party line, our political divide will only widen.  \nMcCain insists that she is a \"tough chick\" who speaks for Red America.  No, she's not: she is a rich, pampered, cloistered white woman of great privilege.  When this tough chick was challenged by Seth Meyers to defend some of her positions, she crumbled and her husband coarsely attacked Meyers for merely doing his job.  In the face of mounting evidence that easy accessibility to assault weapons causes so much bloodshed, McCain  insists  there will be bloodshed if the government tries to take away AK15s.   She is not a journalist; she is nurtured on junk TV, she is rude and unwilling to see something other than her perspective.  Props to Senator Warren, for finishing her thought before McCain could lamely challenge her.  \nReplace her.",

Since discourse now takes place on a battlefield rather than a dinner table, the minority view always believes itself to be under attack rather than just its opinion.  The gloves come off and defenses go up.\nConsequently, our society is ruled by a \"Hobbesian mob of godless Cartesians\".   That is our only choices are the one choice provided by the powerful and there are no eternal truths to which citizens can hold both themselves and the powerful accountable.   Whether it is politics or personal relationships it is the will to power that governs our collective actions.  To say otherwise is to deny things like the lack of freedom of expression in our universities and the rise of Trump on a political level and breakdown of familial relationships and the rise of the materialistic individual on the personal level. \nBut hey, I am an optimist.  As our collective society goes further south people will be forced to open their eyes and change will come and sacrifice for the common good will once again occur as it did at the founding of our nation and people will have real heroes to emulate and follow. \n(It would help if people stayed away from the VR goggles of Fox News and MSNBC and hang out in the library but I know that is asking an awful lot ).",

Did they wind up agreeing on anything?  Rarely, but that\u2019s not the point. They were able to inform people of their views without distortion and the viewing public was better off.  Now sometimes the views heard are completely batty but that\u2019s fine. We cannot be afraid of it. What I would give for 30 minutes with Rachel Maddox and Sean Hannity. I think if they listened to each other, you never know- maybe there would be common ground on some issues.  Not likely but worth a shot",

Meghan McCain's belligerent, domineering, tabloid style reflects this shift.\n\nThe media loves it and has normalized this new brash, cash, and trash Republicanism.  Why?  \n\nThe commercial media in this country thrives on controversy and conflict in the drive for audience ratings/viewers/readers.  This media business model generates advertisers and network revenue, with programming and topics geared to Americans' increasingly shortening attention spans and desire for entertainment, novelty, and shock value.  Epitomized and pushed by Murdoch, Rush, Brietbart, Hannity...and, of course, its rock star Trump!  \n\nIn every phase of our lives, these commercialized cultural-political values appear to operate against empathy, concern for others, consideration, civility, decency, responsibility, and good taste and judgment--remember good taste and judgment?\n\nWill it last, or will it pass?  I say \"pass.\" It is junk-food politics, vacuous, and exhausting.  Meghan McCain will pass with it.\n\nPrediction: We will soon rediscover civility and seek tranquility from the right-wing assault.

Abby Huntsman who is famed for being Gov Huntsman's daughter.  We have Chris Cuomo on CNN, previously famous for being Gov Mario Cuomo's son and the Gov Andrew Cuomo's brother.

This is not to say Behar should do more listening too but her role is also to add some humor. Meghan comes across as self-important as if she's the only one who lost a father or who feels certain ways. Maybe if she found common ground instead of divisiveness-it would work better.

However, as Ibrahim says, it has gotten so exhausting and more and more people seem to be frustrated by the direction the show has taken, I wonder how long it will be until they replace McCain with someone who can engage in more fruitful and productive dialogue.   \nMeghan can be more progressive than the other co-hosts on certain issues (often those pertaining to sex/sexuality and gender) and I feel that The View has had  co-hosts more or at least as conservative as Meghan. To me, this points to the real problem: Meghan's behaviour.",

Furthermore, she clearly loathes and despises her party's elected leader at least as much as most Democrats do.  Yes, she's John McCain's daughter, and her affection and admiration for her late dad are sincere and entirely natural.  Some of her views (most especially on reproductive choice) can strike one as objectionable but it seems to me that the other ladies on the stage have been eminently capable of countering them, whether individually or in unison (for my money Sunny Hostin is just about the best such panelist on any network show).  Those who find Ms. McCain's presence on the show to be problematic should imagine what the program might look like were she to be replaced by, say, the execrable Liz Cheney, an altogether more toxic example of right-wing nepotism.  And, by the way, \"The View\" was never less enjoyable than it was during the apolitical \"Year of Barbara\" when Joy Behar had been shut down and Ms. Goldberg was visibly miserable listening to Ms. McCarthy and Sherri Shepherd sing Ms. Walters' praises on a daily basis.",

Better to have all the viewpoints on regular daytime tv (although I do agree re the talking over one another - though she is not the only one) - rather than have them on cable channels etc where things become even more bipartisan and audiences are in their own political bubbles.

Anna Navarro, also a conservative with a progressive social side, often clashes with her and I find myself siding with Ms. Navarro. Describing abortion as \"murdering babies,\" is extremely inflammable and won't get her any respect. Abby Huntsman, who is somewhere in the middle politically between McCain and her other co-hosts, is often wishy-washy and I'm not sorry to see her leave. But that leaves McCain by herself, struggling to find her place on the panel. I don't think she can learn to control her impulses and her edgy tone, but I wish she would. Her sass and sense of fun should be a source of camaraderie on the show. But her blunt questions and her demand that people see things her way can often render her ineffective. Elizabeth Hassleback rigidness made her a liability on the show.  Shrill doesn't work, and McCain should realize she can attract more flies with honey.  Her father understood this a lot better than she does.",

I maintain that if McCain had won, the Middle East would not be in the state it\u2019s in today. But unfortunately, Wall Street had to mess up our financial system and we had to turn our attention to domestic issues, and President Obama was the man for the job. \n\nThe reason Meghan McCain is an important voice in this debate is because she has never wavered in her stance on, and completely understands, the need for a strong national defense, not the crazy Rand Paul isolationist idea that so many Trumpists subscribe to. To say that The View has a Meghan McCain problem is to woefully misunderstand what\u2019s going on in America. I feel like people are taking out their frustrations with Trump on people like Meghan McCain, when the truth is that she\u2019s really nothing like Trump. It\u2019s becoming nearly impossible to profess conservative beliefs without being immediately discounted. I get it\u2014 it\u2019s because most people cannot stand Donald Trump, myself included. \n\nThe Republican Party is at a breaking point because of him. His lack of civility has trickled down into our discourse, and I think that\u2019s why some people say that Meghan McCain lacks civility. But anybody who watches The View and is honest about it knows that every host can at times come across as uncivil or annoying. That\u2019s the nature of the show. \n\nSo respectfully, I think you need to dig a little deeper here. The problem is not Meghan McCain.",

If they were guests in your home and acted this way, you would likely not invite them back. Whoopi Goldberg's behavior as a guest on Graham Norton is quite different than on The View. Her behavior on Graham Norton seem genuine and likable, consistent with how we have known her over the past forty years. In contrast, as the moderator on The View, she is the new Barbara Walters.  Gloria Graham, the grandmother of women-focused daytime talk shows, was far more genuine but she existed in the early days of television.

Wade found a right to an abortion, which rested on the right to privacy, which was one of a penumbra of rights implied, but not stated, in the Constitution. That sort of logic gives a court the power to do anything.\n\nIf the federal courts simply decided cases and controversies like other country's courts they would not be political. (Or at least, not as blatantly so.) No one in Japan knows or cares who is on their Supreme Court. Japanese courts stay out of politics, while still making sure the Japanese Constitution is observed.\n\nIn America many people vote for president based on who the candidate will appoint to the Supreme Court. How bizarre is that? They \"vote\" for Supreme Court justices instead of a president! So we get things like the Brett Kavanaugh hearings -- a circus, with Christine Ford and Deborah Ramirez playing the part of the clowns.\n\nNowhere else in the world would this kind of thing happen. Our courts have become political. They should be judicial. And people like Linda Greenhouse seem to think that the problem is not that the courts are political, but that they are not always politically liberal.",

Yet for centuries American courts, with notorious exceptions like Dred Scott and Bush v. Gore, have largely ignored or resisted litigants\u2019 efforts to act as partisan tools.\n\nWhat stands between the rule of law as an essential part of democratic self-government and the corrupt political use of judicial power is a court\u2019s ability to show the public that its decisions follow from a reasonable reading of the law and the Constitution; that they are grounded in long-standing precedent; and that litigants in similar circumstances can expect similar outcomes (equal justice). \n\nWhen the Supreme Court overturns precedent, it will appear arbitrary or political unless the decision, like Brown v. Board of Education, can be seen to necessarily follow from the Constitution and principles embodied in the social contract that led to that founding document which remain widely accepted to this day. Because the Roberts Court has issued a number of majority opinions overturning precedent that serve political interests and lack convincing basis in enduring foundational principles, it has greatly eroded confidence in the judiciary to be the protector of constitutional government.",

But the court is not a Congress and nine judges are not a government even when they decide to act like one. History shows us the consequences when this clear fact of separation of powers is violated. The Dred Scot decision of 1858 in which the Court effectively took the issue of slavery out of the control of Congress by granting the legality of slavery in states which had abolished slavery through their own legislative process. This effectively gave American citizens no more ability to address the question politically because it was now a settled constitutional issue. With no more ability to decide the issue through Congress the country had no choice but to go to war.

If he is re-elected, he will likely have the opportunity to appoint two more. Given the resistance movement propensity to take any and all Trump initiatives to court, It is essential for Republicans to fill as many vacant seats in the federal courts with very conservative judges. It\u2019s ironic that Trump, who  has been so disparaged by his opponents, as an incompetent president, should be so successful in restructuring the federal courts. More importantly, at a time when neoliberal philosophy is challenging foundational constitutional principles, like freedom of speech and presumption of innocence and are promulgating initiatives like open borders, re-distribution of wealth and government censorship of disinformation, appointment of conservative judges should be this administration\u2019s top priority. The more intoxicated that liberals become with the failed socialist political paradigms of the past, the more our democracy requires a judiciary that defends the principles embedded in our Constitution.",

Other substantive issues, during trial, appeal, may fast track to a Second Supreme Court....different time frame, but once resolved...the case moves on. \n\nSpecialty courts seem to be a trend (drug courts, and the older juvenile court systems), maybe time for specialty appellate systems. We should be past demanding only nine people decide all these issues, sometimes way late in the process. Justice shouldn\u2019t take 5   years. \n\nI\u2019d like to see you do a series of articles, with your much-closer view of the courts, on possible reforms, changes.

This disconnect between court decisions and the ability of laymen to understand or evaluate these judicial actions helps illuminate, I think, the frustration that many Americans of all political persuasions experience with our system of law.\n\nIn the current environment, liberals are the most vocal critics of the Supreme Court, largely because they fear the impact of of some of its key decisions.  In the 1960s and 1970s, conservatives led attacks on an \"activist\" court which interpreted the Constitution in ways they considered harmful.  \n\nIn both periods, lawyers employed their expertise to explain the flaws in the reasoning behind controversial decisions.  However plausible these analyses, they often did not enlighten the typical layman, who had to evaluate the decisions based on the outcome she preferred.  \n\nIn Roe vs. Wade, how could most people judge the validity of a decision that discovered rights in the Constitution not spelled out in the text?  Popular reaction depended on how each of us felt about a woman's right to have an abortion.  Similarly, in the case involving campaign spending, did it make legal sense to declare that money was  a form of speech?\n\nGreenhouse explains these issues better than most scholars, but a problem remains which affects trust in the rule of law.",

In recent Court activity, relating to immigrants and in the case argued about the shooting of a Mexican boy in Mexico by a Border Patrol agent on the US side of the border, standing has been of critical importance.  The second principle relating to standing is actual harm.  Courts have a terrible problem with potential harm, so many current issues are left unresolved or actively discarded because the bad news has yet to strike.  Among the reasons for creation of law, rules and regulations, there are the classes that I call (a) rules to allow social order and (b) rules to prevent harm.  Examples include federal regulations about how to split up the broadcast spectrum of frequencies for (a) and regulations for management of research on dangerous things, such as viruses, for (b).  Although one can comment on laws and regulations through testimony and through the Federal Register, once these rules are in place, it is hard to sue to remove or revise regulations until the rules themselves have caused a problem.  The issue is establishing standing.  In the case of abortion clinics, it comes back to the fact that we need to prove that the rules caused clinics to close, not just that there was the potential to cause closure.  We physicians know that the rules requiring hospital privileges are a sham, but it is hard to prove, hence the lawsuit in Louisiana.",
