However, as another invisible white middle aged female, I can attest to being ignored in many daily interactions as well as very significant ones. That\u2019s not my point today though. I know from experience that it\u2019s almost impossible to hire administrative and support staff at doctor\u2019s offices, vets, etc because they are first not paid enough to garner qualified and poised adults without a myriad of socio-mental disabilities that, if violated in the job selection, can cause lawsuits against the hiring parties. Thus I can\u2019t reprimand an employee for substandard performance for fear of this being perceived as another of your generations (white black or otherwise) microaggressions. So this new let\u2019s take offense to how my voice isn\u2019t heard or my needs aren\u2019t being met) has resulted in a highly inadequate untrained group of young employees whose standards of performance would never have met those of just 30 years ago. So much for your generation. In trying to guarantee fairness to all individuals, we have truly dumbed down much of our workforce. I am being pragmatic, not racist, ageist, sexist, whatever.

St. Francis\u2019 prayer comes to mind. Our feelings of anger, fear, guilt, and grief (not to mention all the emotional conturbations of the last four years) arise in us naturally and without blame. \n\nOur challenge (my challenge) is to redirect my feelings to trigger empathy, respect and kind behavior, and to keep at this self-transformation unremittingly in encounters with the neighbors: the ones on the bus, on the street, in the gym, in the shops; the ones driving cars, bikes and scooters; and especially the ones just getting by.",

My children have grown up in a far more diverse environment, and are much more open to diversity, and much less racist---they have no memory of a society segregated by law, as I do from my childhood. The poison must die with the people infected. In 30 years, my oldest daughter will be 60, and she and her husband will be the older white voters, and they really will be better.

I'm a person of color (Middle Eastern ancestry). I'm in my 60's. I lived through the Civil Rights era, and believe until 2016 that progress had been made. Oh, not as much as most whites believed, but I did think that our society could, one day, have a place for all of us, regardless of ethnic background or skin color. \n\nAll that changed in 2016. Not a month goes by now that a total stranger doesn't yell a slur at me or my family - \"go back to where you came from.\" Before 2016 I could count on one hand the number of times I heard slurs like this. I was born in Chicago. But none of this matters to these whites. Ms. Kaplan should not regret what she said to the white receptionist. Trump has told whites that they are the only \"real\" Americans, and many more people have absorbed this message than we'd like to think. \n\nThe 2016 election taught me that there were more racist whites than I'd wanted to believe. Trump's election proved that they are the ultimate identity voters. A majority of whites voted for Trump - even white women did. Get your head around this one fact - for a moment. It will be a long time before people of color will ever be equals in this country. \n\nAnd decades of progress have been destroyed in three short years. This truth may be painful, but it is very much the truth.",

Dialogue and ability to see people as individuals with complexities vs stereotypes can help prevent faulty assumptions that lump all suspicious groups into undeserving categorical labeling which is what racists do.\nMs Kaplan\u2019s reasoning is sadly another reason hate and bigotry have become more visible. \u201c If you can\u2019t beat em, join em\u201d isn\u2019t going to make racism go away.",

They ape the qualities about him they denounce. Even as they criticize Trump they are vindicating Trumpism. My view is that this will fail, that you can't out-Trump Trump, that he will always be able to throw more mud at you than you can throw at him. The essay alludes to a different possibility, that you don't have to play the Trump game, that instead of meeting fire with fire, you can meet it with water, with scrupulous honesty, humility, and fairness. Sadly, the 24-hour news cycle and social media make that nearly impossible - to get advertiser dollars everything is always hyped to the nth degree. We live in Trumpian world so it shouldn't be surprising that he's successful in that world and if I were a betting man, I'd say his reelection is a pretty good bet.",

Now it just seems embarrassing - we put a party whose leader is beholden to the fossil fuel lobby in power and we can't say, \"that's partly because not enough people turned out to vote\" the way you can in America. Over 90% of those eligible to vote, voted in our last federal election, and the majority voted for a party that doesn't care about our long-term future, only short-term profit.\n\nThat was in May 2019, well before the fires. I was disgusted then. I'm frightened now.",

Many of the electorates through which this summer's fires have raged have been the most consistent electoral opponents of action against climate change.  Australia is not a nation of people demanding climate change betrayed by a feckless government.  In reality it is a nation reaping the consequences of an electorate that has consistently chosen it's own short term economic benefits over the long-term health of our planet.",

Unlike Australia and the USA, who are doing absolutely nothing to prevent climate change, Siemens is from a country which is actually putting laws into place to limit CO2 emissions, at great cost to its companies and people, despite the fact that Germany will be much less affected by climate change that Australia.

We abandoned the free press, knowingly letting propaganda outlets flourish while gutting funding for CPB, PBS and NPR. \n\nBe very, very careful when you are told that we 'can't afford to manage climate change' or 'throttling Murdoch/Fox means throttling the First Amendment.'

This model of an export driven extraction economy has given Australia three decades of uninterrupted growth and its people one of the highest living standards in the world.  Replacing a high percentage of fossil fuel use with renewables may be possible domestically, but Australia will need to diversify its economy considerably if it is going to dramatically reduce the export of coal and other extracted materials. \n\nAustralia faces the classic \u201cprisoner\u2019s dilemma.\u201d  If it takes aggressive action to curtail its extraction driven export economy, it will suffer considerable short-term economic pain, but the benefits of significant mitigation of climate change will occur only if the largest contributors to global warming also take aggressive action.  Unfortunately, the United States is led by someone who thinks that the government\u2019s answer to climate change is either to pretend it doesn\u2019t exist or to promote \u201cbeautiful, clean coal\u201d as the solution.  And while China seems to contemplating serious steps to kick its coal habit, India appears posed to replace China as a major market for Australian coal. \n\nConsequently, we may not need to wait for the Judgment Day to find out if we will all burn in hell; we may end up burning in the hell we have created for ourselves on earth.",

In the 1938-1939 brushfire season fires occurred  for the whole summer, and ash fell as far away as New Zealand. It was calculated that three-quarters of the State of Victoria was directly or indirectly affected by the disaster, while other Australian states were also badly hit by fires and extreme heat. In 1974, 290 million acres burned which is equivalent to the combined total area of France, Spain, and Portugal.\n \nBrush fires are endemic to Australia.

The Bank for International Settlements (a Swiss-based international institution, not an Australian one, that few people had heard of until last week) wrote a speculative report about ultimate potential outcomes that suggested that central banks generally may at some point in the future be required to step in and acquire so-called stranded assets to avoid financial collapse (in part because they may be uninsurable). \n\nHyperventilating over such reports and the number of proposed coal mine developments or extensions, which are primarily for the purpose of export (not domestic power generation) and in large part of metallurgical (steel-making, for which there is no commercial substitute) coal is the sort of hyperbole that undermines your case.  \n\nCoal is a legally traded commodity, that the rest of the world continues to demand and continues to purchase. I agree there is no reason any Australian domestic power should be generated by it today (I note there are NO realistic private sector plans to build any new coal-fired power plants in Australia - only a half-arsed suggestion proposal by a couple of fringe right-wing MPs) - but to decide unilaterally to stop supplying our 2nd most valuable export commodity (after iron ore) to world markets is a spite-your-nose solution that would do nothing to reduce world coal consumption.",

Oftentimes they respond with boilerplate language reiterating the incumbent\u2019s overarching view of government in general and nothing addressing the specific subject. Nor can I bear to watch this trial live since very few of the jurors seem interested in hearing the facts and instead telegraph their predetermined verdict by body language, etc. So, in the interest of not raising my blood pressure, I read about it later. Based on the facts I\u2019ve heard, I\u2019m fairly certain the president is guilty. However, I would be very interested in hearing from more witnesses. But the president would not allow them to testify before the House and the GOP has made it clear that they are unwilling to call for their testimony during the trial. They have, as a body, also made it clear they will find him innocent. So I ask, what is an ordinary citizen to do during this process? Our government has failed us, the brilliant system of checks and balances our founding fathers established has failed us, the electoral college has failed us. Is it any wonder we seem apathetic?

Adam Schiff, the would-be perpetrator of \"the most massive interference in an election in American history\" (according to Pat A. Cipollone, believer in the if-they-accuse-you-accuse-them-back approach) pleaded heroically for moral courage before a twiddling aggregate of milk-sober lawmakers, much like Mr. Smith when he went to Washington, although it was not milk being drunk in that movie.\n\n2. The Commander in Chief, who, if we believe certain sources, refuses to wear a condom when entertaining a prostitute, proclaimed, \"Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.\" (Note: if strong defense has not been provided in one area, it is certainly good to proclaim it in another.)\n\n3. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lost his head after being asked uncomfortable questions by a female journalist. Could it be Pompeo was first in his class only because there were no anger management classes at that particular institution?\n\nBut stay tuned. There is still much to know and much to learn.",

What was so striking were the film clips from a very modern 1939 Germany and Austria, with the Nazi flags and banners hung everywhere and the Nazi salutes by every passing pedestrian in front of bronze busts of Hitler on street corners, etc.  And all the people who had completely bought into the insanity of that time and place -- within the lifetime of many Americans who are still living.  The juxtaposition with today was gut-wrenching.  European historian Tony Judt warned time and again that history has not ended, and bad, very bad things could happen once more -- with men having no moral compass other than an obsession with power and  winning like Mitch McConnell leading the way.

The real unfairness is impeachment without a crime.\n\nI know, there's plenty in the legislative history of the Constitution to support the argument that impeachment doesn't require a crime. But impeachment should require a crime. Otherwise, politics and criminal justice must mix, and they are immiscible.\n\nWe should avoid following Israel, Brazil, South Korea and others down the road of using criminal law as a political weapon. Bill Clinton's impeachment. Hillary Clinton's email investigation. The Mueller investigation of Donald Trump. Now Donald Trump's impeachment. All were steps too far down that road.\n\nWe have never used bills of attainder or made any conduct criminal only after the fact. Impeachment and trial by a legislature is close to doing that. Too close.\n\nImpeachment is an archaic procedure adopted by the British parliament in the Middle Ages and abandoned there more than 200 years ago. We should make it obsolete here as well. Shame on both Republicans in 1998 and Democrats in 2019 for abusing a criminal procedure for political gain.",

Since he appoints the most incompetent and corrupt officials and the decent ones get fired or retire, he has a full rein in destroying our democracy.\n\nEven with all the ties to Putin and the Russian mob, the most egregious behavior has been demonstrated by the republican Congress.  I am not sure the American people understand that Russia bought and paid for the president and the republican congress.  Hence their fealty to him and all things Russian.  It is a moral outrage which over time will diminish our moral standing in the world along with our treasury.\n\nUntil the media stops cooperating with this administration, nothing will change.

Trump has been accused of conspiring with Putin, getting in bed with Kim, starting war with Iran, extorting Mexico, going soft on China, abandoning NATO, being a loose cannon around nuclear weapons and on and on.  \n\nOn the home front, he's accused of supporting neo-Nazis, co-oping the Justice Department, favoring pollution, putting kids in cages and separating them from their parents, giving billionaires a free ride, running to government for personal gain and on and on.\n\nIn all the accusations, there is a kernel of truth,  but there's always exaggeration.  For example, the kids were in cages because of an unexpected flood of immigrants which eventually led to a special appropriation.\n\nDemocrats on Trump, while grounded in truth have been highly politicized.  And in the process they have stretched credibility. Now that they have landed on a solid accusation, the public is jaded. It's all about crying wolf too often.",

And certainly not because his campaign didn\u2019t seek to \u201ccollude\u201d with the Russians to undermine the 2016 election and put in the fix for Trump. No it\u2019s a sham because Trump is guilty of everything he has been accused of and \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d.

I\u2019m sorry but I would have preferred the House Democrats hounded him with investigations right up to the 2020 election, he has so many metaphorical bodies buried it would of looked like a graveyard by November. The democrats took a stand on principle, unfortunately they were always standing on shaky ground. Now Trump gets exonerated, the Republicans continue to ignore Russian interference in the next election and if we are very unlucky we get another four years of the most corrupt president in modern history.

Also, show the proper courtesy and respect to the Democratic senators presenting this case that they would wish to be shown.  Where do they think they are?  On Fox News?

This is Dark Ages stuff and worse than I thought.\n\nBut historians will have a field day documenting and describing the Reign of Trump Terror--unless, of course, Trump and the GOP win in 2020.

It turns out that Lisa Murkowski, who may have rejected Adam Schiff's report is now confronted by corroboration that Trump himself had, indeed, made that statement.  Trump seems to be enjoying this disgraceful spectacle greatly.  Because his top priority at all times, is gratifying himself.  He has no commitment to his oath of office.  What troubles me is that the Republicans seem to be indifferent to Trump's disgraceful, destructive, derelict, dastardly statements.  Trump is all good.  Any whoever opposes him is all bad.  Such polarized thinking is infantile.  With every minute that passes, Trump places the US at higher risk for being attacked, because he undermines national security for his own amusement.",

Your average juror has to take off work sometimes losing weeks of salaries, while jury duty pays minimal amounts. The Republican senators are paid quite handsomely for being a senator and still they complain that they have to put up with hearing the case against Trump. The most deliberative body in the world at the most important trial of the times and the Republican senators whine that they are bored of sitting. Maybe if they allowed witnesses and documents they wouldn't be so bored. They might even learn new facts that truly pertain to the truth about Trump's Ukraine dealings and obstructions. SAD.

DJT will not help them when they have to look back in history and see how they tossed the Constitution like a bag of chips. Senate is a separate and independent body of government and the senators owe nothing to the executive branch,least of all to one man who has made this country a laughing stock.",

What I did not know was that almost half of America admired and would voted for a corrupt reality TV star and New York real estate developer.  What I did not know is that Trump would call for help from the Russians in smearing Hillary Clinton and interfering to help him get elected.  What I did not know was that the Republican Party would lock-step behind him in his destruction of the American government.  What I did not know was that many in the media would help Trump by ignoring and excusing his dishonesty and corruption on a daily basis to keep him in office and their bottom lines nicely padded in the years to come.  What I did not know was the area in which I live would become a totally red Trump haven in which I would struggle to live as a Democrat.  What I do know that is once Trump is acquitted he will know that he has no boundaries and life in America will change again.  And last, what I do know is that I am going to spend this week planning how to live, survive, and thrive in Trump's America.  It will be a challenge.  There will be no suspense about the outcome of this Senate trial.  Good luck to us all.",

The turning point in abuse of Executive power, after the restraints of the 70\u2019s, was the Iran-Contra hearings of the 1980\u2019s. Here, the Reagan administration did an end-around an explicit law passed by Congress forbidding arm sales to the Contras. I remember being riveted to these hearings, hoping for the truth from what I naively believed were honorable people\nlike Secretary of State George Shultz. I was as in my mid 30\u2019s at the time. Result? There were no repercussions for these lawbreakers, except for a low level colonel. Since that time, after watching our duopoly Party participants consistently undermine the economic wherewithal of the general population through allegiance to their corporate/banker paymasters AND consistently sow warfare(financial &bloody) throughout the world, I am in a different place.

As to enthusiasm gaps - it would be unseemly for dem staffers to run around celebrating.  Nancy Pelosi set the right tone.  Besides they're doing all the work - getting the facts right and in order.  It is a sad and numbing time - both to starkly revisit the full horror of Trump's deeds and words - and to figure out how we get from here to there (November).

Meanwhile, a vote for witnesses and conviction would only enhance his popularity among the Utah majority which rejects Trump.

If he plans to run again at all that is.\n\nThe question therefore isn't really political. The questions are:\n\n1) Does Romney fear Republican/Trump retaliation in some other way? Is there some punitive measure the Party will take to punish Utah for Romney's disloyalty?\n\nAnd 2) Does Romney believe he has the power to carry other Republicans? If he doesn't, is Romney willing to take a symbolic stand in honor of his oath?\n\nAccording to at least one Romney adviser, the Senator believes he as the influence to carry wavering Republicans over to the other side. For my part, I will support Romney's reelection if takes a stand here instead of wilting like so many other Republican moderates. America needs a leader. Romney is the guy. Now is the time.",

Most people who suffer from a fear of rejection have experienced trauma in childhood that has conditioned them to not only expect rejection but to reject others. Without psychoanalyzing Trump, I\u2019d say Trump is a trauma survivor. Through his daily tweets, he projects that fear of rejection. So what is a fear of rejection? It\u2019s a fear of being abandoned, and it includes feelings of shame and self-blame. On the savanna, it\u2019s fatal for animals to be abandoned. Humans still have that primal fear, but today we can isolate ourselves. I\u2019m convinced that a lot of spiteful things Trump says and does are based on a fear of rejection. He anticipates being rejected by people around him, by society, based on his earlier experiences with his father. That\u2019s why he loves rallies\u2014for the unconditional love and adulation he never got growing up. He craves acceptance, but he\u2019s so insecure and needy he\u2019ll destroy everything you hold dear first because he anticipates your rejection. And he abuses us with his tweets because he was abused. The weak Republican senators and his followers who because of their own need for acceptance and fear of rejection will enable the father in his illness, will lie and cover for him to maintain the artifice that he\u2019s strong and courageous because to admit otherwise would be the destruction of their world.

The House chose the pace, whether to go to court to subpoena witnesses and take on executive privilege (a real thing).

This now seems so quaint as to be absurd that it ever captured the attention of the American electorate much less the world; that Clinton is still shamed for it to this day and every day that will come after his passing, seems more than sufficient penance.\n\nIt was not an issue of national security because once it was publically known there was no threat of extortion from foreign bodies or governments.\n\nThe Clinton Impeachment is much more about the Gingrich-led GOP,  their quest for perpetual power and their fear that a Clinton-led Democratic party would keep the Democrats in favour for a generation to come. It's primary interest is the idea that the grain of indiscretion was enough for the Republicans to pursue his removal from office whereas the grave and monumental crimes of the current President do not appear to trouble the GOP at all.

Mueller was prevented from investigating Trump\u2019s finances by Rod Rosenstein, and William Barr terminated the investigation prematurely. \nRemarkably, virtually the entire Republican delegation in Congress is in complete denial of all of this. \nThe GOP has become the Gang of Putin!",

DJT is like the crazy uncle who knows no better and it's pointless to even waste effort on him, but Mitch knows better - as do his lieutenants and foot soldiers in the senate. That is why these proceedings are so sad. I don't think Adam Schiff could have done a better job than he did. I had some initial hope that a few Republicans would do the right thing and vote for witnesses. But now, it's like watching a funeral. These are the seven people who knew better, did nothing, and have likely destroyed our democracy as we know it: Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Corey Gardner, Lamar Alexander.

The most memorable moment was the Senator from California's effort to gin up a cute line about busing (not cute) and hawk some t-shirts after the debate.  Very Presidential, huh?  \n\nSo now we turn to the primaries a caucuses.  The bizarre caucuses and arcane delegate selection process now await us.  I read that Bernie is surging in Iowa.  Joe is doing something and Elizabeth is not surging.  Independents, who are the key to this election despise all three.\n\nTrump is unfit and should be removed from office either by the Senate or at the ballot box.  The Dems will not achieve the former and are working hard to achieve the latter thanks to their process.  \n\nThe only thing left is the 401k election.  An economic calamity that results in a meltdown or serious recession before election.  It worked in 08 and can work again.  Pinning your hopes on the suffering of others is no way to run a campaign. \n\nPat Paulsen for President.",

In the event that suspicions that all of this is mendacity ring true, it seems worthwhile to mention a few things. The Democrats want Trump out because they can't find the evidence that Mercer's whiz kids \"rigged\" the election, and so they try to blame the RF and Putin, which is where it does not lie. The problem with Ukraine is that with all of the western  investment it is still in doubt whether an offensive military establishment requisite for installing a puppet and exploiting the treasure trove of natural resources  which the RF has is feasible. Obviously, with the dissolution of the SU, the nuclear weapons exited and rampant corruption replaced them, especially under Poroshenko. So much for abuse of power, the real substance of which is in Trump's Iran policy. The MQ-9 is not out of sight, but is out of mind, and after it struck, 6 F-35s were strategically placed on Iran's borders. More abuse. Trump does display actions commensurate with the criminal mind, but it seems that in addition to the election fraud which put him in office, there was collusion with H.Clinton, who didn't really want to win, and likely assented to the fixing scheme. This is all obfuscation rather than obstruction. Whether he has the power to obviate criminal proceedings against him through executive privilege remains to be observed.",

Article 2 provides him with the ultimate shield from scrutiny - the toy he always wanted for Christmas. His taxes, his money laundering, his philandering, his bribery - all the skeletons, are hidden from investigation, let alone prosecution. He can do anything, order non-disclosure, and rest assured that congress can do nothing.\n\nAll future presidents will enjoy this power when the Senate does not remove Trump.

If they call witnesses, the truth (more likely) comes out.  If they don't, they are clearly complicit and not interested in the truth.  \nListening to all of the House managers, but particularly Schiff, made me proud.  Not only a brilliant presentation in which they brought the witnesses into the room through recorded testimony, but the flow of Schiff's oratory that merged law with emotion and virtue was phenomenal.  He gently but clearly tried to provoke them, asking: \"Who are you?\" \"What are you?\".  \nI bet he also succeeded in bolstering the Democratic base--finally, someone who is virtuous who can stand up and call it like it is with true intent and integrity. All of those outcomes were wins for Democrats and for the entire country.",

That's a longer run than in Athens, and it is partly because the founding fathers had some good ideas, such as separation of powers and the Bill of Rights.\n\nPlato might have said the Achilles heel of democracy is the voters.  If they are not fully informed they can be influenced by demagogues to vote against their own self-interest.  Thus democracies often degenerate into tyranny, or as we would say autocracy.\n\nThe impeachment trial will likely be a political victory for Trump.  It all comes down to the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has several advantages.  Incumbents usually win reelection.  And the economy is strong by measures the public looks at like GDP and the level of the Dow.  Actually the plight of poor Americans is dismal.\n\nIn 2016 Trump received 63 million votes to Clinton's 66 million, but Trump won the electoral college.  There were also about 100 million eligible voters who didn't vote.  That works out to Trump receiving 27.5% support from eligible voters.\n\nTrump can be defeated but only if Democrats seize the middle.  Trump's outrageous behavior however seems to have pushed Democrats further to the left.\n\nIt will be a close election.  It is important for Democrats to get their strategy in order.",

This Senate impeachment trial, this moment in American history, is in the hands of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, and his power resides in the meaning of the word \"preside.\" In the world of checks & balances, the executive branch and the legislative branch are hogging the impeachment stage. In the end, when the House managers and Trump's lawyers have had their say, one man, John Roberts, if he so chooses, can restore order and honor to our current bout of madness.",

This is a crisis of confidence, or credibility, and of integrity. Our nation is indeed at a crossroads. Will we pursue the search for truth, or will we dodge, weave and evade the truth? I am of course referring to the investigation into serious allegations of illegal conduct by the president of the US. That the president has engaged in a persistent pattern and practice of obstruction of justice. The allegations are grave, the investigation is legitimate, and ascertaining the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the unqualified, unevasive truth is absolutely critical. The search for truth is led by... Star. Mr. President I am deeply troubled today because Judge Starr\u2019s pursuit of the truth is being undermined every step of the way, every single day in the press by those whose sole mission is to attack and impugn the court-appointed independent prosecutor and the congressionally-created process. And these attackers are not the journalists or the broadcasters. Mr. President, what troubles me most here is that these reckless attacks, these ruthless onslaughts, are being carried out by the closest advisers to the president of the US.The smear campaign is being orchestrated by the WH.",

Once the GOP is willing to build arguments on propositions that are in fact false their rhetoric and epistomology become chaotic and valueless.\n\nNot only all Senators but all Americans should heed Schiff's warning, in the echo of Niem\u00f6ller, that they could be next. Next for no reason other than Trump finds you in his way.\n\nWhilst many voted for Trump knowing of his many, grievous personality flaws it can only be hoped that at least some have repented their choice. \n\nDemocrats may indeed rely on facts. Republicans do not. Republicans will use any scheme of claims that get them what they want. They have the right wing media echo chambers to amplify their propaganda. \n\nNo one can seriously expect the Senate to aquit.

No one's fooled by their games anymore.\n\nIn Washington, the bottom line is staying in power and getting re-elected. Duty to country and Constitution is now a horse-and-buggy anachronism. And the enlightened ideals this country was founded on? They appear to be next.",

Perhaps we should not expect more as the Republican Party (Mitch McConnell) stated upon the election of Obama that their goal was to limit him to one term.  Their goal was not to find common ground for the benefit of the country. Their goal was not to seek to improve the life of everyday Americans. Their goal was not to represent the interests of the voters. Their goal was to limit Obama to one term. And today we have a president whose first priority is himself and he has managed to deceive a substantial part of the electorate that he works for them. If he decided supporting climate change efforts would work to his political advantage he would change his position overnight.",

Some of the differences between (liberal, progressives, Dems) and (conservative, right, Reps) include how we value and understand the relationship between facts and beliefs, critical thought and hypocrisy. \n\nScience teaches us that if new information becomes available, one should at least review their position, if not reconsider it. Many conservatives see this approach as not really being committed to one\u2019s beliefs. \n\nFor example, one of the sayings the political right has is, \u201cAmerica, love it or leave it.\u201d Now, the writings we have from American\u2019s Founding Fathers, whom conservatives laud, exemplify that critical discourse is essential to democracy. \n\nConservatives tend to also dislike freedom of religion (unless its Christianity), free press, free speech. When taken with their dislike of critical discourse, it is them who should really \u201clove it or leave it.\u201d \n\nWhen I have pointed out the above hypocrisy to conservatives, typically, they are nonplussed. This is because avoiding hypocrisy is really not high on conservative list of values. \n\nSuggesting that they would act differently if the shoe was on the other foot presupposes that they wouldn\u2019t want to be seen as hypocritical. \n\nBut if the Reps just want their side to win and don\u2019t care how they do it, the current situation is just about the Reps continuing to win, and that is happening, so that is good. \u201cFairness\u201d doesn\u2019t factor into it.\n\n\n.",

Even disregarding the Ukraine affair does anyone really believe this is the only mafioso-like operation that Trump has been engaged in -- the guy has operated like this for decades. Does any GOP rep and senator really believe this will never come to the surface.\n\nThe deeper issue is that there is a fundamental problem with the presidency, if not with the institution itself then at least how it is viewed. Presidents main roles are less and less that of policy thinkers and leaders, but more and more personifications of cultural rifts to the extend of creating personality cults. The presidency has always had a strong monarchic streak already in its initial conception -- and that has come to untenable fruition in the age of reality-TV and social media.\n\nIMO, America has to take a very hard look at the institution of the presidency and whether this is a survival concept going forward.",

Perversely, this has given each party's Donor Class (which in many cases are the same people) even greater control over the primaries and therefore the menu of candidates in general elections.  The abortion issue can give purpose and meaning to voters who believe that abortion is murder.  No matter what one's station in life, saving millions of innocents can (and should be) incredibly motivating. \nAlthough I personally don't share this belief, it's entirely understandable that believers come out for the primaries. The Republican establishment never delivered.  But Trump appears to be delivering (while blowing off healthcare, among other promises).  Thus, his ability to threaten the re-election of Senators who buck him.\nSo that's all understandable.  But why would McConnell at this point in life care when he knows (he's very smart) that a) Trump is, as Doonesbury once said of Nixon, Guilty, Guilty, Guilty, b) acquitting Trump elevates the Presidency into a monarchy, and c) he's eventually going to lose or die.\nMaybe he believes in an afterlife and believes that ending abortion gets him into The Good Place.\nOr perhaps like Smeagol in the Lord of the Rings \"the Precious\" turned him into Gollum. Where's my Samwise Gamgee?",

You're asking us to consider how we would act if someone behaviour was consistently exemplary turned out to be misusing the power of his office behind the scenes.\n\nSome have suggested \"what if it was Hillary\" but even then, as much as I now resent that woman, the smearing of her character for several decades has been outright slander. Lots of reasons not to like Hillary, but none of them fit the Republican Crooked Hillary narrative.\n\nNo, the best character for this counterfactual is John Edwards. When we found out about his misuse of campaign funds (I should say alleged misuse, as he was never convicted) to cover up an affair and love child while his wife was dying--well, there was some shock and even some denial. The truth was so at odds with the public persona we had already seen. We didn't want to believe it. But I don't think there's anyone out there who's still Team John Edwards.\n\nBut even then, this isn't a fair comparison. Trump's scheme with Ukraine is shocking mostly for how unshocking it is, coming from him. This is not a wild deviation from the Trump that has been on display. It is 100% consistent with that person. He's an objectively horrible person with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. (And man, that is an accomplishment!)\n\nPussygate, kids in cages, Stormy Daniels, etc. etc. etc. He deserves to be impeached.

The evidence is that in the USA the application of justice discriminates and does not dispense blind decisions to all citizens.\nIf one can afford the best lawyers with corresponding political influence, justice may be applied with a lot more leniency, than to the regular John Doe, so in a way our justice system is flawed.",

He is merely a caricature of what is wrong with the Republican Party. Remove him, and not all would be fixed, but the groundwork toward healing would be established.\n\nThe Republicans should let Trump be convicted. Get rid of him, and let President Pence reset the tone of the Party toward something more palatable to the electorate. (A fantasy, perhaps.) But if the Republicans lose in the election this year (from my lips to God's ears) it will be because of Trump, not because of any regressive actions the Party itself has taken (even with such a wide array of them to choose from).\n\nSpeaking of fantasies, what I'd like to see is a deal made with Trump. If he agreed to not run for a second term, then Congress would let him finish out his first and only term with no further pressure to remove him. Let him go out quietly, and promise him that no further investigations into his private finances or relationship with Putin or duping the government into paying $150 million in his golf fees would be done. He would be scot free. If he doesn't agree to this, and announce it very publicly, then it would all continue, even after his second term if he wins, and would end up with him in jail.\n\nIt will never happen.

The party should be spending its time and energy finding the best possible presidential candidate for nomination in 2020, to ensure a win, and prepping someone up for 2024, not wasting them on this pointless sideshow. But we're caught up now in our own whirlwind of rhetoric.\n\nLook out for the \"deplorables\" in November. You think they care about Ukraine?",

The fact that academics, the man on the street and many, many other categories of folks were imagining the shameful crimes and misdemeanors of trump well before his election is, for me, proof that Americans in general are morally, ethically and rationally challenged. People no longer know what good is. Trump should be investigated for so many other \"crimes\": rabble-rousing hate-mongers, mocking the dis-advantaged or the handicapped, starting useless trade wars that cripple the American labor pool, then crowing glorious victory when he capitulates...so much more than Ukraine to gripe about. Obama never would have been here, and even those opposed to him know this. Remember McCain chastising the woman who said he was a Muslim? Trump should be impeached again and again and again. If he gets off this time, the House should send more articles to the Senate. There's so much to choose from. Obama? Well it would be unimaginable.",

They say those lawyers won the day with their arguments that Democrats want only to delete Trump from the ballot in November and are trying to overturn the results of the 2016.

Because, after all, he\u2019s the president and, as he has told us several times, he can do whatever he wants under Article II of the Constitution.

Sen. Ron Johnson was quoted in the WaPo 5 days before the election: \"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, told a Wisconsin newspaper Monday that Clinton could be impeached, citing federal laws against 'willful concealment and destruction.'\"\n\nIn that same article: \"the chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee, told The Washington Post he is personally convinced Clinton should be impeached for influence peddling involving her family foundation. He favors further congressional investigation into that matter.\"  That was Trent Franks.\n\nThe next day, in Vanity Fair (4 Nov 2016): \u201cAssuming she wins, and the investigation goes forward, and it looks like an indictment is pending, at that point in time, under the Constitution, the House of Representatives would engage in an impeachment trial,\" Texas Rep. Michael McCaul said on Fox News. \n\nSo when the Trump team says Dems are trying to overturn an election, let's remember Republicans were planning to do EXACTLY that even BEFORE the election!",

However, I'd also be livid and want him removed immediately as the whole point of choosing Obama was for him to protect our Constitutional Republic, not destroy it. \n\nYou think you can use this exercise to understand what drives Republicans instead of accepting that Republicans act as they do because the GOP is a true right-wing Authoritarian Party backing a true right-wing Authoritarian Despot. \n\nIf you still doubt how fundamentally different Democrats and Republicans are, consider how facts and truth mean nothing to Republicans. Like Trump, Republicans lie, ignore facts, and destroy truth, (and destroy the country), to win. Then look at the Democratic Primary.

But there was a Republican president in the White House.  We were still involved in Vietnam.  We'd had the gas shortage.  People were reluctant to believe that a president would engage in criminal activity or countenance it if he knew about it.  Nixon's resignation probably changed the history of America.  \n\nNever again would the generations who were old enough to be aware of what was happening trust the government to do the right thing.  Many of us didn't want anything to do with politics.  We were disgusted with all of them.  I remember feeling betrayed.  Now I'm older and watching the GOP defend Trump's actions horrifies me.  It horrifies me to see and hear people marching and chanting \"Jews will not replace us\".  What horrifies even more is that it's accepted by our president.  \n\nObama's presidency was boring.  He tried to his job.  Trump's presidency has been one scandal after another.  I worry that if he is not removed from office future presidents will take his acquittal as license to do whatever they please.  The difference between Obama and Trump is immense.  Obama was far from perfect but he had a conscience.  Hilary Clinton, for all her self serving statements, had a conscience about Benghazi.  \n\n1/25/2020 10:48pm first submit",

Kamala Harris), and Biden would have had the complete package.\nBut with a single public announcement by the Ukraine (Trump couldn't care less about an actual investigation) he'd take out his most dangerous opponent, and let the Dems shred one another for months into defeat.\nWithout the whistle blower, he'd have completely gotten away with it (those meddling kids!).  \nBut, as it seems the Republican Senators are wiling to say that 2+2=5, he can blow off his impeachment as nothing more than sour grapes AND still leaves Biden wounded.\nTrump, it is obvious, cannot feel shame, but he does have a genius for seeing into motivators of many: proximity to power, greed and fear.   Like the self-promoting genius he is, he found a way to fuse a well-groomed base of resentment to his own persona. His Impeachment is now no more than the Pharisees attempting to crucify their Savior. \nBut unlike that model of kindness, Trump hits back harder.\nWhat a great, great piece of entertainment.

I would warn everyone I knew away from him as a dangerously unstable sociopath displaying the classic duo traits of extreme narcissism coupled with extremely low empathy that warn of a cruel, often criminal personality.    Vice principal?  Ha!  I wouldn't trust him to bag groceries.\n\nNeal Katyal's thought experiment is one that peoples my nightmares.  Donald Trump is either unaware of or doesn't care about the complexities that governing presents.  He has branded all Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters enemies, even though they account for half the people in the country.   He seems unaware that Independents and Democrats are also part of his constituency.  It's too complex for him to fathom,  I think.  \nWhen it comes to international politics, Trump is even worse.  Witness him fawning on Vladimir Putin, as if Putin was our most favored ally, and our NATO allies the real enemies.  He's clueless.\n\nFinally, if Barack Obama did ANY of the things that Trump has done (emoluments clause, unsecured phone, leaked Israeli secrets to the Russians, abandoned allies to death, abandoned Americans to death)  I'd be the first to be calling for his removal from office.  Because this is not about party at all.  It's about competence, empathy, and ability to govern.\n\nAnd Donald Trump has none of those traits.",

Now that this Republican Senate will absolve Trump of obvious criminal wrongdoing, what will he do next?\n\nTrump has ordered thousands of Hispanic children into internment camps, with no plans to ever reunite them with their families. And not a whisper of disapproval from his Republican toadies. Trump has publicly said that the KKK and neo-Nazis are some very fine people and his Republican toadies continue to kowtow to him, as hate crimes against ethnic minorities skyrocket.\n\nWe can now expect Trump to become even more extreme. There is literally nothing he would not do to ensure his position in the Oval Office. He certainly will not leave voluntarily, in 2020 or 2024. \n\nTrump needs to continue to stoke the hatred of his base. So we should expect this \"president\" to continue to target minorities. There is no reason to think that he won't expand the internment camps to include U.S. citizens. This Supreme Court has undertaken the most ridiculous legal contortions to uphold his Muslim ban and Wall funding - acts entirely devoid of any supporting evidence. In short, Trump is now limited only by his imagination and the laws of physics. \n\nAnd for those of us who aren't white, aren't straight, or aren't Christian, we must redouble our efforts to ensure our safety, and the safety of our families.

No problem, Dems said, because Obama\u2019s star spangled democracy bombs are designed by Raytheon to spread peace and justice and universal happiness, in an ethical and politically correct way, with due regard for diversity issues.\n\nIt's amazing that self-obsessed liberals are wringing their hands over a Ukraine phone call, but didn't care that the Dems almost unanimously funded the buffoons $739 billion military budget (Warren voted for it) and the trillion dollar nuclear trainwreck started under Obama. No outrage is sputtered about the civilian deaths in Afghanistan or the US funding of ISIS.\n\nMr.Kristof seems to have a very low opinion on the intellectual capacity of NYT readers.",

Though I voted for Obama twice and will vote for any Democrat in November, even those I don't particularly like, I don't think it's quite that easy and clear-cut.\n\nThat Obama was the first African American president would have tainted the calls for impeachment with our nation's history of white supremacy and raised real questions among his supporters whether those making the charges were driven by racial bias. Furthermore, given that Republicans' stated intention to hamstring an Obama presidency and deny the president any political victory, I would wonder whether the charges of misconduct were motivated by the Republican's obstructionist agenda.\n\nAfter a life time of watching the mendacity of Donald Trump, I can't fathom how anyone could admire him. However, millions do, and given the Democrats' hatred of him, I can understand how his fans would be suspicious.\n\nTwo details in the case against President Trump, though, would weigh on me if President Obama had done the same. Against the beliefs of US intelligence officers, Trump promoted Russian propaganda, and rather than use the institutions of American justice to pursue allegations against the Bidens, Trump secretly used private actors. These are the actions of a dictator, not the leader of a democracy.",

What if we were talking about Biden or Sanders or Warren? What would you feel?\n\nOnce Trump is acquitted, the answer is not much. If a Supreme Court position was vacant today, a Democratic Senate wouldn't bat an eyelid over refusing a vote on any Trump nominee. So too with foreign election interference. Future presidents from both parties will be expected to solicit foreign help. Thanks to McConnell, this is the new normal.\n\nNATO, if you're listening, Democrats could use some help.

I assumed the French hated him and were out to get him because he won and wasn't French.  One of my friends told me Armstrong was using stuff they couldn't test for. It wasn't until so much evidence came forward from so many people (and books like Wheelmen, where I read definitely about blood doping in the bus) that I realized that the guy I admired cheated his way through 7 winning TdFs. All the years and stages and wins I saw had the taint of drugs.  But he did it to win, and reportedly has no regrets. \n\nI needed convincing evidence, and my bar was higher than the French bar, because I didn't want to believe otherwise. That's sort of why evidence matters. Armstrong got away with this for years by force of personality.  Keeping more evidence out of the trial allows Republican Senators to wear their red MAGA hats. With Armstrong, it was blood doping; with the Senate, it's just a lot of dopes.  \n\nArmstrong's avoiding Josef Beloki's crash in 2003, however, showed the quickest thinking and best riding I ever saw.

Trump will be free to do as he pleases, and I fear he will be reelected, especially if Bernie or Warren becomes the nominee.  The right-wing/Russian echo chamber will bury them.",

Johnson was impeached for disobeying the Tenure of Office Act, which made it impossible for a President to remove a cabinet member without approval from Congress.  Johnson vetoed the Act, but Congress overrode the veto.  (SCOTUS overturned the law later on.)  Impeachment failed and Johnson left after his term. \n\nThe difference between Johnson and Trump was that Johnson wasn\u2019t withholding Congressionally appropriated fund from a foreign government to get that government to manufacture a scandal for a political rival.  Johnson should have simply sued to push the case to SCOTUS earlier.  Trump went to great lengths to keep Congress and the American people from finding out what he was doing.  Trump\u2019s impeachment is legitimate, and the evidence for his removal is overwhelming. \n\nRepublicans know this, of course. And after being unable to impeach any Democrats they\u2019re going to accept the high crimes of one their own. When Trump is acquitted Republicans have to know that they are just as responsible for Trump\u2019s illegal actions as he is.  The Republican party and Donald Trump will be forever linked and any time they attempt to scold Americans about honor, morality, or the dignity of the office the response will be easy: \u201cDonald Trump is a Republican.\u201d",

Although, I often suspect that what's at the heart of their continued support of Trump is purely emotional: people don't like to admit they made massive mistakes. Republicans had no less than 16 other candidates in the run up to 2016 and picked the least qualified one hands down. A quick search for justification set in with these folks when it became obvious after the election that Trump was a terrible pick. Seeking others who made a similar choice, there is safety in numbers, and helps to rationalize the daily deceit, incompetence and corruption: the Supreme Court is at stake, religious freedom, reproductive choice, jobs,. etc., pick your cherished cause. Their 2016 vote is further rationalized and reinforced by watching cable news and following social media messages with others who made the same mistake. They are fooled into believing they are the last defense between decency and anarchy. Watching this Republican psychosis unfold from the sidelines has certainly been a wake up call for me. I do not believe I would ever display such poor judgement or practice situational ethics in justifying corruption in exchange for cherished policy issues. I cannot say the same for others in my party.",

The second Bush was not impeached.

Then this goes the other way too, since we have a long history of our 45th pres and so it is right in his character to be doing this stuff.  So that thought experiment only goes so far.  \n\n I remember when Clinton was impeached I was alot younger, being 61 now.  I recall I was pretty mad that they were going after him for a what many were calling a personal issue.  I then found out he lied and etc, etc, my views did change.  I now see that with all we know now about power differential and sexual harassment in the workplace I would see it all differently.  I did have a hard time believing he was lying under oath!  \n\nthe school scenario, I would clearly not be Okay with the whole scenario, but clearly these things go on all the time and people in power positions learn how they can game the system for personal game and to cover up misdeeds and crimes.   \n\nThe biggest take away of this whole thing/thought experiment is that all of us doing this are the kinds of people that would reflect and contemplate and question our own beliefs and actions, something I fear many people would not do.

In Ukraine, there is a strong echo of that same drive.\n\nRegardless of one's political orientation, there is more than enough to conclude Trump must go.

The Republicans are setting a trap here - and the entire process should be halted - in order to focus on the forum where these issues can be handled in a non-preordained matter i.e. the election.\n\nSo, when the Republicans refuse to handle this as a matter of evidence and trial, the Democrats (rather than continuing this farce of a trial) should abstain and turn this matter back to the People, saying:  \"We have placed the evidence before the public, and if the Senate will not try the President, then it is even more important that the People do so in the coming election.

The most insightful historical comment about the trial was the observation that the founders of the constitution never anticipated the Senate being corrupt- Justice Roberts was more than kind with his own assessment of where the Senate ranks as a deliberative body. Consider the 'jurors' in our impeachment trial. Some admit before the trial they are not impartial and openly coordinate with the accused. They read, attend to 'intestinal problems', fidget, sleep, and who knows what during key parts of the trial. The presenters for the president sometimes lie in lock step with the accused as if they were dictating tweets. \n\nI think the founders did an amazing job writing the constitution given they could in no way predict things like twitter, the internet in general, the complexity of the world market, etc. If everyone was willing to attend to the 'spirit' of the constitution with integrity I think we could all live with the resulting rough edges. The Republicans however are not playing with rough edges. They are openly gutting parts of the constitution without shame. \n\nSomethin drastic must happen or the American experiment is in jeopardy of failing.",

And then there's Trump... whose trail of abuse to people he has hired or even people he supposedly was working with has left a litany of tales of a man who has no respect for the law or the truth. In other words, Trump is uniquely unqualified on so many levels not to be president that the country is on a cliff and he is easily capable of pushing it over the edge into chaos. Certainly the price of the lesson learned by electing Trump is something that should concern every voter in 2020. And the fact that GOP congressmen have embraced trump with steel hoops of loyalty is also of major concern to anyone who loves this country and wants to see it recover and once again be a world leader for all the right reason. So Kristof\u2019s experiment, hopefully after 2020s election, will simply be resolved in the bright morning sunshine when a Democrat is in the White House and a majority of Democrats are in the Senate.",

Many if not most would deny the facts, deny the alleged act was impeachable, argue impeachment was the result of hatred not principle. No different from Republican voters today, and that's understandable. It's also why impeachment is not decided through a national referendum, but by the Senate. Men (now men and women) the Founders believed could rise above faction and place their oath to uphold the Constitution above loyalty to a president. \n\nIt's an incredibly difficult task, I won't deny that. Most Republicans refused to abandon Nixon during Watergate. However, once the \"smoking gun\" tape was released, all but a minority of Republican Representatives and Senators were willing to remove Nixon from office. \n\nAlas, instead of Baker, Goldwater, and Hugh Scott, we have McConnell, Nunes, and Romney.

A spy planted inside the Humphrey campaign. A break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist. The Watergate break-in merely opened the door on the fact that all of these acts were bankrolled by a slush fund in Nixon's re-election campaign. Nixon struggled to cover-up the connection between CREEP, as it was eventually known, and that break-in. In doing so Nixon leveraged the powers of the presidency, including most of the national security apparatus. \n\nTrump is no different here. He used the presidency in an effort to damage a political rival, Joe Biden. If he's acquitted now, he'll be emboldened to do worse between now and November 3. Whose to say what he'll do if he loses.

Still stung by Russian interference in the 2016 election, Clinton decided to pressure, in exchange for US support on trade and other issues, the new Russian leader to divulge information on the efforts of his predecessor Putin to sow confusion in the 2016 American presidential campaign. \nWhatever the merits in that scenario of getting to the bottom of Putin\u2019s secret meddling, that projection of presidential diplomatic power across international borders to supply dirt on the campaign of a potential re-election rival would have been an abuse of power. Republicans would have been right to seek impeachment for using coercive diplomacy for that purpose. \nImpeachment on that ground alone might have failed to remove a President Clinton from office because of party loyalties, but the charges and a vigorous trial would have set an important precedent to deter present and future Presidents from assuming the personalized power of Roman emperors.",

This is why in the House the Republicans made no attempt and search for the truth and now they are blocking all witnesses and documents. Our system of government has collapsed. The executive branch is autocratic and the Senate is a rubber stamp body under Mitch McConnell. The House is still democratic but for ademocracy to function both the president and Congress must support democracy. So far this appears to be a sham trial in the Senate which is what you would expect in an autocratic government. We keep hoping that the Republicans will show some signs of supporting democracy again but so far all of these hopes have been dashed.

I would be resistant to believing that Obama would attempt to subvert democracy, as Trump has clearly, repeatedly done, but if it were demonstrated that he had done so, then I could only conclude that he would be unfit for public service. No, I am not holding Republicans to a higher standard than I would hold myself. For the past thirty years, I have only ever expected them to be decent, honest, reasonable human beings, and for the past thirty years they have failed to approach that standard at every opportunity. To me, the question of foreign interference is merely a practical detail; the core problem in Trump's conduct is his attack on the democratic election process, which amounts to treason, pure and simple. It is the same reason that I consider Republican gerrymandering and other forms of electioneering to be treason as well, and fully demanding of the punishments for treason that our Constitution sets out. An attack on democracy is an attack on all of us, and has no place in any level of our government.",

There is a difference between being \"immoral\" and \"amoral.\"  The former implies there is at least a conscience.

What power does the president hold over so many republicans that they refuse to face the facts put before them and want to protect him and lie for him?  I can't believe this is happening in The United States of American.  Why are some republicans attacking media and reporters.  Where does all this vile language and vitriol come from?

So I'm scratching my head as to why Trump and his guys feel they need this latest shift. One problem is it reopens the door to the question of whether he did something really bad, and they\u2019re only arguing that the case should be tried in a different court, this fall's election.\n\nAnd one more problem. These guys must have been passing notes in eighth grade civics. If settling things at the next election is always how we should go, then why did our founders even put the possibility of impeachment and removal from office in the Constitution?\n\nBut it's a losing game. Trump never was going to be removed, and he always was ultimately going to be judged in the fall election anyway.

All were steps too far down that road.\n\nWe have never used bills of attainder or made any conduct criminal only after the fact. Impeachment and trial by a legislature is close to doing that. Too close.\n\nImpeachment is an archaic procedure adopted by the British parliament in the Middle Ages and abandoned there more than 200 years ago. We should make it obsolete here as well.

It said that the \"faithful execution of the law\" - the Impoundment Control Act- \"does not permit the president to substitute his own policy priorities for those congress has enacted into law .\"\n\nBut, yes, it does - when it comes to \"Foreign\" policy.\nThe Constitution allocates to the president sole authority over foreign policy (short of declaring war or signing a treaty). It does not permit Congress to substitute its foreign policy preferences for those of the president.\n\nBecause the Dems are arguing that the statute at issue constrains the power of the president to conduct foreign policy, they are acting in an unconstitutional manner.\n\nSo despite what Trump did or did not do with regard to the Ukrainian money \u2014 which was eventually sent without strings \u2014 he certainly had the authority to delay sending the funds. \n\nWhat is not being discussed AT ALL is what exactly did Biden do when he was VP and who benefitted by his actions\u2026but we won't go there for this editorial.",

That was ALL true of the Democratic managers from the House, and the Democratic senators I've heard comment on these issues in the media.  Yet, the Republicans in leadership, and this defense team think we are all idiots and can't see they are attempting to defend the president by attacking the process and the messengers versus the actual behavior of the president.  He is guilty by his own words and actions.  He stated he wanted Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens.  He demanded that their be no documents or witnesses granted.  Inviting foreign influence in our elections is illegal. Defying lawful subpoenas is illegal. If he thought there was reason to investigate the Bidens, he had two years with Republican leadership in the majority and he could have done it.  He did NOT.  There was no reason, other than his desire to smear an opponent that was polling much better than he.  Justice must be served.  The day of reckoning will come.",

And it's also the reason our Constitution is a failure. The framers greatly mistrusted government by a people's assembly. They created a popular assembly\u2014the House\u2014but then checked it by denying it executive power and instead giving that most essential power to a president and by creating a second legislative body, the Senate, to limit the House's power. Neither the president nor the Senate were directly elected by the people. Senators were originally appointed by state legislatures. The Constitution also requires no popular election for the Electoral College, and early on many states simply appointed their electors, holding no popular election for the President at all. \n\nDistrusting the people and fearing rule by a mob, the framers instead\u2014in true Enlightenment Fashion\u2014felt they could create a perfectly calibrated machine where the various spheres of government balanced each other with forces of push and pull preventing any from flying out of orbit. The people might be the prime mover, but the machine would operate mostly without them. \n\nIn fact\u2014contrary to the framers' belief\u2014the best control on the government is a popular assembly, a parliament, responsible for both the executive and legislative functions of government and highly responsive to the people's will through regular direct elections. The framer's contraption is not working. It's time to try real democracy.",

How are Americans suppose to accept that there is no remedy to hold an President accountable for Abuse of powers? Are the American people expected to accept that the new normal is allowing a corrupt President who doesn\u2019t consider their own national security on par with his own political ambitions? That elections are free game rife with foreign interference done at the behest of American enemies and the President himself?Ask yourself what happens when people can no longer trust their country to do the right thing.

We hear statements that say, not quite explicitly, \"Who needs democracy if we have good employment statistics?\"  That is equivalent to the supporters of Benito Mussolini saying that \"He made the trains run on time.\"\n\nIn this case it is likely that the American people will see through these arguments, but the Republican senators live in fear of the wrath of Trump and his hard core base of Republican voters.

In truth over 11 million more votes were cast for candidates that were NOT Trump in the 2016 election. And that was before he turned out to be unimaginably worse than anyone predicted. I think the fear we all have now that this outrage could be repeated in 2020 is good. We're on our toes. But he's already a giant loser with most of the larger public. Fox props him up with greater and greater difficulty. He and his Friends have zero credibility with non-dittoheads. Since day one of this farce against democracy I've wondered how much rope it will take for Trump & gang to hang themselves. It's taken much more than I thought, but I believe the sham trial in the Senate will finally be it. The Republican suppression of the truth will be rocket fuel for Dems come November. So go ahead, do your worst, you nasty Trumpies. The country and world are watching - and chomping at the bit for the 2020 losing landslide you deserve.",

It's progressive in that it seeks to invalidate the present in the name of the future. It's cynical because this future is imagined  to be determined by holding onto power, rather than transforming it. It imagines a future that's only acceptable if it resembles the past.\n\nWe might as well say that it doesn't matter who wins the primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire, since that person will only be invalidating the last election....",

This circus that the GOP has intended to create from the start of the proceedings will run its course with Trump still in office, but hopefully those undecided voters who have heard the facts presented clearly and precisely will now recognize this dire situation for what it is and join us in removing this plague come November.

It doesn't matter if it flies in the face of tradition, or the workings of the Constitution, b/c they'll just define both of them any way they want to.\n\nWe have one party interested in governing, & one interested in locking up the system so nothing can ever be changed. \n\nRepublican governance has become nothing more than a long delaying action until 5 ultra-rightwing Supreme Court justices (all picked by the Federalist Society) can be confirmed. When this happens, the Courts will be able to return to us to the 1920s. Indeed, all progress made since the Dred Scott decision may be up for reconsideration. \n\nBut none of that will matter to their supporters. Because they don't really want the government to do anything anyway, except build a wall and cut their taxes. In other words, what they would do if *they* were elected! What's \"right\", \"wrong\" or \"lame\" has nothing to do with any of this.",

If that policy wasn't in existence--and it shouldn't be--Trump would have been indicted when his attorney Michael Cohen was with the same result, a jail sentence.\n\nNow the idea that people should have the say in voting out a president and impeachment should take a backseat is another harebrained idea by the Republicans to keep Trump in power.  Unfortunately, they have the majority in the Senate and will probably acquit Trump.  \n\nHopefully, the people will not only vote Trump out but also the Republican Senators who seem to put their party above their country.",

Another party has gained control of the House.

We need to be perfectly clear that impeachment is *not* about extemporaneous mind-changing. The Constitution does not concern itself with signs that a president has simply fallen from favor with the public. Though impeachment is a political process, it's not a political barometer. The reply to the Republicans' sophistry about vote-canceling should go like this:\n\nSay I'm elected president. It's a thousand pities, but there it is. A sufficient number of voters (fortuitously distributed) chose to trust me with the powers and responsibilities of the office. I then proceed to abuse those powers and throw off those responsibilities. Impeaching me on such grounds doesn't amount to canceling people's votes, because they can't have voted me in to do what a president must not do. On the contrary, I've violated their trust and must therefore be removed. Any voters who say they wanted a rogue president all along can be ignored.

I'm fairly certain that the Founders would have thought that having each Representative constituency average over three quarters of a million citizens was absurd (the Constitution only indicates a 30,000 minimum for a representative, and while no one could foresee a nation of 330 million, I don't think anyone foresaw an artificially truncated number of legislators, either).",

But we need to look at this feeble argument about the \"voters deciding\" to see what Republicans really mean. What they mean is that \"their voters\" should get to decide everything - and only the voices of their voters count for any actions they take.\n\nThe fact is, a majority of us are sickened by this \"president\". But we understand now that our votes mean nothing. And we know that Trump and the Republicans will do everything within their power (and with Russian assistance) to ensure that Trump is re-elected - including cheating and widespread vote tampering. This isn't a surmise or supposition. We know they will do this. They have said as much. \n\nSo when the Republicans claim that we should \"let the voters decide\" they mean only those voters who will keep them in office. The rest of us no longer have a voice in this government, even though we are the majority.\n\nI have been shocked at the passivity of Americans on the left, though, as they continue to look the other way while Trump consolidates absolute power. People of any other democracy would have been in the streets, every week, for the past three years. And yet, Trump and the Republican Senate have effected a bloodless coup, with absolutely no sustained opposition from us.\n\nThink your vote still counts? Think again.

In one hour his defense lawyers completely destroyed 21 hours (really months) of insinuation and obfuscation.  The charge against Trump is that he abused his power by pressuring the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens in order to receive aid that was on hold.  The defense lawyers showed in short order that that is impossible.  Never mind that the Ukrainians said there was no pressure.  Never mind that Trump never mentions any quid pro quo in the phone call.  Never mind that nobody could testify that Trump told them to withhold funds for an investigation.  Never mind that all the diplomats said that investigations never came up in any discussion with the Ukrainians.  Nobody in the US government or representing Trump or Trump himself ever told the Ukrainians that they needed to conduct an investigation to get aid.  We know this, because the evidence is overwhelming that they found out about the hold on aid when the news leaked in a Politico article over a month after the July 25 phone call.  In other words, for almost the entire time aid was being withheld, the Ukrainians did not know about it, and they only found out from a news article.  Clearly, there was no effort to pressure the Ukrainians.  This trial is over.  It should be dismissed on this evidence alone.",

There are no counterparts in the Dems to the Repub's, Jordan, Nunes, Graham, McConnell, Cruz, McCarthy, et al. At best there's an AOC, and she's not a threat! \n\nBret, former Repubs (who just want the GOP Clubhouse back) reflexively denigrate Dem candidates.

Trump clearly does not believe in the rule of law,  especially when he interferes with his transactional aspirations.  The likely failure of Impeachment would only embolden his documented criminal actions and surely taking his criminality to new levels.  There was a reason that the left wing Social Democratic Party of Germany supported the right wing Paul von Hindenburg in the presidential elections of 1931 - as reactionary as Hindenburg was they knew that he would uphold the legal system of the Weimar Republic and strongly suspected correctly that his opponent Adolph Hitler wouldn't.   Stephens knows that a president by her or himself cannot realize large domestic changes without the support of the legislative body, and likely the Supreme Court.  Roosevelt wasn't able the them radical New Deal by fiat, nor could a Sanders or Warren. Trump beside operating as an unconstrained felon can also do real harm but gutting  environmental protections when the planet might be in a death spiral.  I would say to Stephens what the journalist said to the scientist at the end of the Godzilla film who was concerned that the weapon that could destroy the monster could cause other damage.   Brett, you have your fears that could be come reality, but you have Trump which is reality.",

The use of your estimable perch both to smear as \"reckless\" these candidates for the presidency who are responding to growing socioeconomic inequality and to suggest that the current agent of public indecency and enemy of government is better than they is, well, reckless.",

Personally I could write for pages explaining the objections I have to Obama\u2019s policies, especially those that knowingly gave away billions to corporations and banks while screwing over homeowners who were sucked into unpayable loans. But I was never ashamed of him as president. Surely I don\u2019t need to remind you that Obama speaks in full sentences and would never have bragged about assaulting women. Life with Trump is a nightmare. His sympathy with the racist right and his tendency to bring out the worst in this country\u2019s bigots is undeniable. As Michael Cohen put it he is a liar, a con man, and a cheat. Both Sanders and Warren want to defend the American people from such real dangers as bankruptcy due to heath costs (still a huge threat) and the real effects of climate change. Trump is still trying to undo the real gains in Obamacare and supports fracking despite (or because of?) the damage to the environment. His destruction of environmental regulation is unending. You are right in saying that he is a \u201cmorally corrosive and corrupting force\u201d but I suppose you really believe that socialized healthcare will bankrupt us, but consider the fact that this country now puts more money into military spending and endless wars than the military budgets of the next 7 highest spending countries and those include Russia and China. Most of the rest are American allies. Of course those \u201callies\u201d are the most common victims of Trump\u2019s insults. Go figure.",

Under Trump, the rights of POC, women, and immigrants have been stripped. Environmental protection policies have been rolled back, making more people vulnerable to future devastating effects of climate change. When you talk about labor, I hear an argument for keeping millions in minimum wage jobs, trapped under the imprisonments of corporate bosses and owners. If you think that Americans experience daily life as \u201cmostly the same\u201d under Trump and Obama, you haven\u2019t been listening, and you must live in a bubble. When I listen and learn about the hopes and policy implications of Sanders and Warren campaigns, I see possibility for a more equal and just and healthier future - for individuals and the environment. So what if more people work for the government instead of private insurance companies and Amazon warehouses? Why should the pursuit of free markets and unchecked capitalism lead to mass poverty and inequality? Where is your moral center? Where did you go wrong?",

As others have noted, almost anything of note has to get through congress.  If the democrats fail to retake the senate-- which is entirely plausible-- the entire Bernie domestic policy platform is mostly dead on arrival.  Even a slim senate majority would require dems to win in conservative states, so they'd not be marching in lockstep.  You'd need a supermajority to overcome the inevitable filibusters, and I don't know of any projections for a democratic senate supermajority.  And (now the history brush up) even when dems did have a supermajority in 2008, passing the ACA was an epic struggle.\nWhen I look at Sanders and Warren I'm mostly annoyed at how they pander to civic ignorance.  If they were honest they'd admit that their projects, under the current system, are at best aspirational.  Anyway, you are a New York Times political columnist and should really know better. \nI think Sanders in particular would be an ineffective president, well meaning but weak kind of like Carter.

This philosophy has enriched the upper classes to the point where it has financialized our economy. This has had a devastating effect on our manufacturing base and virtually all industries that middle-class America relied upon to support itself. This approach has altered our government\u2019s fiscal priorities by drying up tax revenue we used to reserve for social programs used to support the majority of Americans. The middle-class has suffered and shrunk over the past several decades. This is why today we reference the loss of the American Dream. The supply-side economic approach has created jobs, millions of jobs. And unemployment overall has been low, historically low in some cases. However, the jobs that have been created by this approach are low-wage hourly jobs that could not sustain one\u2019s living, forcing many Americans to string together two or more of these jobs for survival. And overall, wages have failed to increase while Americans have been forced to work more hours and take less vacation time than our northern European brethren. Frankly, unless you are well-off, I think you would be voting against your own economic interest if you did not enthusiastically support either Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren.",

Stephens argues that while Trump wants to do all these bad things, he hasn't been able to.  On the other hand, somehow Sanders and Warren will both be able to implement every program they've ever considered.  That's disingenuous to the extreme.  \n\nIn addition to the logical inconsistency (comparing apples to oranges), it's worse.  In the 2nd term, if Trump beats impeachment, he may actually be able to implement those programs he's wanted to but has been held back by institutional resistance. The institutional checks have been eroding (see the impeachment trial), and with an additional electoral victory by Trump, they will likely collapse. An emboldened Trump will be worse than any possible Democrat.\n\nAnd as for Sanders and Warren, while both are pushing policies that would entail dramatic change, Stephens should be smart enough to know that they will need to be modified to pass Congress, so his fears of radical change are unwarranted.  But while not all their policies will pass,  at least they are pushing in the right direction and the people pushing them are moral, responsible, intelligent leaders (in contrast to Trump).   \n\nTrump is an existential threat to this country, so yes, it requires voting for ANY Democrat over Trump.",

He acknowledged that Trump is a menace, but still could not imagine himself voting for Warren or Sanders.\n\nThese reactions appear visceral, and manifest themselves as something like \"yes, Trump presents a fascist threat, but nothing nearly as dangerous as 'socialism.'\" The GOP's blowing up of the deficit to give even more money to rich people is met with a yawn, but OMG, don't let the progressives in or it's economic doom!\n\nThe most powerful part of the propaganda is not informational, but emotional. It is the generalized transmission of a feeling; a sense of foreboding with regard to anything that even whiffs of social reform. As we can see here, even pundits like Stephens can't avoid its subconscious undercurrents. Unfortunately for the rest of us, they then use their formidable writing skills to spread fallacious arguments without even realizing that they are doing it.",

However, pretty much any northern Europe country has done so, a lot of them very successfully, \nin particular Scandinavian countries. And all have a lower GDP per capita than the US. Of course you can go to far in \"socialism\", like France but that will take many presidencies. Meanwhile, if I remember it correctly, did opinion polls show that if Bernie Sanders would have been the Democratic candidate for presidency in 2016, he would have beaten Donald Trump. I think that a core issue is that a large part of the US electorate has lost faith in the political establishment. As an outsider, Trump did profit by this in 2016. Outsiders such as Bernie Sanders and to a lesser degree Elizabeth Warren, may therefore be best positioned to recapture the Oval Office.",

Wealth inequality is out of control and steering us towards serious crisis; the wealthy pay the lowest taxes; climate change is being ignored to all of our peril; subsidies still exist for thriving pet industries (agriculture, oil, etc.); and our infrastructure is toast.\n\nAnd what about the human component of it all?

It needs to be assaulted to solve social inequality, to protect the environment and address climate change, and to provide a better health care system.\nSome where behind your rhetoric is a fear that your old convictions have failed this country and given us Trumpism and you can't quite bring yourself to suggest that we need change, not just from Trumpism, but from business as usual with, say, Joe Biden, who you endorse by omission.  \nBret, don't just hear Gail Collins, listen to her.

For most Americans, nothing about life is much the same under Trump as it was under Obama.\n\nOf course, the Americans this author cares about are really not the majority of Americans, are they?  The author also fails to mention that the more writers like himself dismiss whatever Trump attempts, the more he attempts to promote and protect himself, the more he destroys America. \n\nAlso the argument understates and trivializes the radicalism of what the administrations of Reagan, Clinton, Bush and Obama have allowed American capitalism to become.  The wealth gap is an assault not only on the majority of American citizens but also on capitalism itself, turning it into crony capitalism.  The wealth gap has wreaked devastating dislocations to millions of American workers lasting for years.  It has ALREADY had disastrous effects on the country that will persist for decades.\n\nIn quoting calculations from an economist from the Manhattan Institute, founded by Antony Fisher and former CIA Director, Bill Casey, the author neglects mentioning the hundreds of millions of dollars we have spent on unneeded weapons systems and an unneeded war in Iraq.  He also neglects mentioning the recent unneeded tax break that gave corporations and the obscenely wealthy more unneeded millions.\n\nI find it highly unlikely that any program of Sanders or Warren would wreak the devastation already wreaked upon the country by the Iraq War or the now still widening income gap.",

Neither Elizabeth Warren nor Bernie Sanders believes that Article II of the Constitution grants them the right to do whatever they want.  Both know that they have to work with Congress and, in spite of what they say on the campaign trail, they know that they won't be replacing private health insurance and laying off millions of workers any time soon.  Fracking won't be eliminated immediately either but the methane leaks surrounding it may be.  Additionally, while Donald Trump may not yet have accomplished all of his most disastrous plans, he has appointed hundreds of judges and two supreme court justices that will shift our nation to the right for decades. While I wish her the best of health, the likelihood that Ruth Bader Ginsburg can serve another 5 years on the Supreme court is slim. The fact is that while Donald Trump is reckless and may be the \"devil we know\", neither Bernie Sanders nor Elizabeth Warren is reckless and neither is the \"devil\".  So, while we might be better served by an Amy Klobuchar or a Joe Biden, I'll take either Bernie or Elizabeth over Donald any day!",

This country can and should encourage immigration - legal immigration.  Our failure to do so is very much a bipartisan failing.\n\nImportantly, our economy under Trump is strong.\n\nThe fact is that the socialist policies espoused by Senators Sanders and Warren would likely devastate this country, and risk doing far more harm than another Trump presidency.  For strong evidence, look at Venezuela. Venezuela is a country endowed with fabulous natural resources. And yet, thanks in part to socialism, it is a failed country. The collapse of Venezuela happened quickly.  For another example, consider Zimbabwe.\n\nThere is an alternative to another term of President Trump: the Democrats could nominate a rational, centrist candidate.

I cannot see myself voting for Sanders (not a Democrat) or Warren. Simply, they are too far too my left; just as far to the right as Trump is. I genuinely think their socialist policies would be devastating to the country.  If they win the nomination, I will not vote for President. Many other Democratic and Democratic leaning voters in the states that will determine the election feel the same. Please check out the recent NYT The Daily podcast about union voters in Pennsylvania.  Getting a few more radical voters in CA or N.Y. won't help to defeat Trump. Arguing, as many of the readers do here, that Congress will prevent the enactment of their radical agenda is a weak justification for supporting Sanders and Warren.",

Apart from FDR in times of crisis living Americans cannot begin to comprehend, that has never happened.\n\nBut underneath it is the false notion of a Sanders cult. Yes, Sanders represents a movement as much as it does a political campaign and, like Trump, it's a movement as timeless in our politics as the nativism Trump tapped.\n\nBut Sanders is no Huey Long. The entire theme of his campaign is anti-ego, no dear leader, no messiah, no \"I alone can fix it.\" \n\nSanders is no William Jennings Bryant, driven by religious fervor, relying on biblical images to create dangerous yet moving oratory like Bryant's Cross of Gold speech.\n\nThe Democratic party will not fall into line behind president Sanders as Republicans did with Trump. And Republicans certainly won't follow Sanders.\n\nSo, more gridlock? Perhaps, but electing Joe Biden takes us back to the conditions that created Trump in the first place. All candidates offer visions that seem absolute but Sanders is a wise, veteran politician who seeks to tip the scales. \n\nThey need tipping. And as counterintuitive as it may seem, that may be just the adjustment our politics needs. We're not swapping out loons here, just moving in a long-deferred but necessary direction.",

That is bad enough to make people fear what an unstable, incompetent Trump, surrounded by sycophants and dangerous tools like Barr, with no adults in the room and no guardrails, may yet do in an unbridled 2nd term.\n\nNevertheless, Stephens may be right that enough voters who are disgusted by Trump and would be open to a Biden or Buttigieg would reject Warren and Sanders, to the point of giving Trump a 2nd term -- not because they'd vote for Trump, but because they'd sit out the election. But that leads us back to the fact that of the 109 million nonvoters who gave us Trump, 66% were under 50, and 33% were under 30.

Who are excessively screened at airports and rejected from entering the country without any justification? \n\nWhat about all the Latinos who fear of being deported after dedicating their lives to US productivity? \n\nWhat about all the African Americans who are told in their faces that their voices don\u2019t matter? That their votes don\u2019t count?\n\nEven among whites, what about all the Jews who feel threatened in their existence by the surge of domestic terror attacks because white supremacists feel empowered by a President who says that there are good people on both sides? \n\nWhat about women who feel they do not have agency over their own bodies because of men who feel empowered by a President who says he can touch women in their private parts and openly attends an anti-abortion rally? \n\nWords can be as powerful as actions. The words this President speaks and writes empower parts of our society that are destructive and dangerous. This is why the Trump Presidency is dangerous and this is why it cannot be repeated \u2014 no matter what.",

She is as moderate a candidate as we can afford. \n\nYour conservatism may once have been a stabilizing influence. I question that, but I'll accept it as a hypothetical.

If a Democrat wins in 2020, especially if it is one of the avowed Marxist-Socialist-Leninist candidates, the reaction to the historic accomplishment of the Trump administration will be fast and furious and led to conflict, confusion, and disaster.\n\nFor this reason, I look forward to the re-election of Donald J. Trump so that sanity will prevail for at least another four years. Too bad he can't be re-elected again, and again, and again.\n\nTrump is the best thing that has happened to America since Ronald Reagan. Reagan followed the one-term disasterous presidency of Jimmy Carter, during which time America reached the lowest ebb of national prestige and power, humiliated by Iran.\n\nSimilarly, Trump followed Obama, who allowed Iran to gain prominence and power in the Middle East, paving the way for Iran eventually acquire nuclear weapons. Trump is fixing all of that, repairing the damage Iran has done to America since Carter and Obama.\n\nIn this context, it is important to consider the fact that the missiles Iran fired upon the defenseless Ukrainian airliner were purchased from Russia.  Ask yourself, if you dare, where did Iran get the money to make such a purchase?  From the cash provided by Obama, of course!\n\nNo we can't go back to Democrat rule, we must stay the course with Trump for as long as possible. Thank you.",

Merely because jobs will be shifted in say the health insurance or fracking industries should Sanders or Warren prevail, is not a reason to deny them the office. Both of those industries must be reformed as their current practices are unsustainable in their current form. While the candidates are busy thinking through how to adjust them to improve their efficiencies, functionalities, and in the case of fracking, to reduce or eliminate their potent toxicities, you prefer to let them persist as is until they fail utterly and poison us in the process. \n\nYou fail to recognize that we are at a crossroads in the human story. Radical shifts in everything we do are required if we are to survive the next century, let alone thrive in it. Extolling the status quo is doomed to abject failure and the only way to make the requisite changes is to deeply understand & somatically internalize that everything we have built our exploitive, capitalist structure on is a flimsy foundation.

Never mind that the psychic toll Trump has taken on our nation is evident everywhere.  \n\nThere is also the class aspect and his cherry-picking of a right-wing think tank's stat to bolster his case, which I won't go into (because calling the NYT out on its class bias is a waste of breath; they simply can't see it). But I think that white people have a moral responsibility to not equivocate on this, and take responsibility for this white supremacist president and get him out.  For privileged white people like this author (and myself), a Sanders presidency might actually cause some \"harm\" to them in the short run. But fundamentally, privileged white people who are so scared of the Sanders presidency will be absolutely fine.  I am happy to give up some of my privilege (and paycheck via taxes) so that we can get this racist white supremacist out and have a social safety net that ensures everyone has a decent standard of living in the richest country in the world.

The idea that we should prop up bloated, inefficient industries like the medical insurance industry seems to me like something conservatives usually rail against.",

I had access to the finest medical care in the US as a child. I was privileged though.  I would gladly give up that system for the system in Japan. I can walk 5 minutes and find five doctors. I can get an MRI for $50 in any number of places. My friend needed surgery a month ago for a kidney problem. They could offer it to him within the week even though there was no emergency. He was in the hospital for 3 nights and it cost him under $450 with a private room. Americans cannot imagine what they are missing. They simply don't know and the medical establishment yells boo to scare them silly. But it works in all the developed countries not just here in Japan.\nFurthermore, the gap between the rich and privileged and the poor in the US is tearing the country apart and probably is the main factor that allowed for the con artist Donald Trump to come to power and further poison the system.

Small businesses complained they couldn't compete with big companies in terms of coverage for employees and self-employed people were paying a small fortune they couldn't justify in purchasing.  Obama was elected and the creation of the ACA was passed.  It worked in solving most of the Healthcare disfunction but was not perfect and had some issues that needed correcting.  As a result of the disfunction of the ACA, the Republican's incorrectly diagnosed the Healthcare issue as being fine before the ACA and subsequently went about dismantling it.   Today, America agrees that Healthcare is still the number one issue.  But, poll after poll, shows American's overwhelmingly want their employer group plans and to fix the ACA.  Not a call for socialize medicine.",

A President Sanders or Warren will not be able to dissolve the medical insurance industry the first week in office.\nThat is why I'm not comfortable with Sanders or Warren, though I endorse all their ideas. They're zealots; they're not politicians, especially Sanders. They can make more progress promoting their ideas in the Senate while working for a President Klobichar, Biden, Budigeg or, what the hell, Bloomberg.\nThe next Democrat president is also going to have to sit down and play serious, high-stakes stud poker with Vladimir Putin. I don't see Warren or Sanders doing that very well either, for the same reasons above.",

They are a reaction to the fact that trajectory to power and influence, system of succession, in probably every modern democracy is still far from perfect, that for all concept of say American Revolution there was no clean and decisive break from the past. The successful people in society in not dissimilar fashion to times and places over all of history not only rise to the top but preserve place for descendants to detriment of ideals of power and influence based on merit.\n\nThe key is to somehow articulate power, influence, succession by pure merit but this probably will offend both left and right political leanings of today.",

He has not closed the border to all immigrants, but he has labeled them rapists and murderers while whipping up his base, and separated parents from their children. And let\u2019s not forget, these people are fleeing very dangerous and unstable place and cling on for life during a perilous trip.

It's a mess now (if you think not, you haven't had to use it).  Let's admit failure and not let the flawed reasoning of having made massive investments of scarce resources justify America's further descent.  One scary example:  the USA has the highest maternal mortality rate in the industrialized world.  And, every year, we fall further behind across a wide variety of health outcomes.  But, we should continue to let the healthcare housefire rage out of control because it will upset the system?  It needs to be upset!\n\nAs to common ground, the President and Sen.

We have no shelter housing for homeless as well. And we have homeless living in our woods behind shopping centers. We must use clergy association funds on a debit card to supply shelter at motels for women and children. There is a homeless crisis everywhere not just in California and Florida.

Our state system uses 211 as an access point where clients must call the number to register. So far I have spent 5 hours per client trying to get state services for them without a firm decision on eligibility. The systems did not work under Obama and it is worse. Much worse now. I really think this has something to do with elites and globalists allowing this chaos to cause deaths of our most vulnerable humans. It is a dastardly way to control population. And irregardless of our political persuasions we involved community volunteers are upset in general with our federal government and state governments and the taxpayers yelling \u201c I don\u2019t want my taxes to go up and I don\u2019t want homeless sleeping in my parks. \u201c \nBrett time to visit some small towns of less than 40000 to see things are worse all the time.",

All elements of the global security regime, global trading regime, and global economic regime are at risk.  Stephens used to care about those things.

He always spoke from the heart and he has an amazing track record of voting the right way when almost everyone else was wrong. \n     \nOur system has checks and balances. There is no reason to fear Bernie Sanders.",

Happy days are here again.  But no investment happened.  Has Trump punished corporations who didn't do what he said they would do, like he did China and the EU and Iran?  No, he did not.  So income inequality hasn't been narrowed, it has substantially widened.  And now, despite his denials, he plans on cutting all social programs the way Republicans have wanted for years.  The 90% just didn't suffer enough back in the Pre-Depression days.  We need to go back there.  This time the 10% will do the right thing.  But they have proven, at every opportunity to do so, they will not.  \"We cannot afford what Sanders and Warren suggest\" is the right's rallying cry.  Except, actually, we can.  We choose not to.  We choose to allow Bezos and Buffett and Gates, et al to amass ungodly sums.  They then sit and wonder what to do with it.  The thought of sharing that wealth with those that helped them amass it didn't enter their minds then and it doesn't now.  The teacher redistributing  the toys the bully takes away from all the other kids is the right thing to do.   And is easy to do.",

I prefer Medicare-for-all-who-want-it as a transitional approach, BUT:  it appears from Advisory.com and a cited Kaiser Foundation study that Americans spend on the order of 13% of their income on health insurance: so the stated rate of increase in the payroll tax would appear NOT to increase health insurance net costs to Americans -- just who they are paying it to -- and would increase coverage and portability, creating freedom for workers who could flex and move with the economy rather than be tied to jobs and locations to ensure health coverage.\n\n2.  I support a strong military and spending for it (but we need strategic reform on weapons systems etc.).  It facilitates American  leadership and an economic system that fosters peace and prosperity.  But when you start comparing American taxing and spending to other countries, remember that other countries are not spending at our level for defense.  If we want our big military -- I do -- we should pay for it, and not by cutting First World levels of government functioning elsewhere in the budget.\n\n3.  Trump IS a destroyer of our national social fabric, and of our constitutional system, on an order no other politician presents (though entire R. party is with him on that).  Bernie/Warren will not pass their unadulterated agendas.  I'm more concerned that by trying for so much, they will achieve less than others might.  But I will vote for either of them over Trump.",

In that sense, insofar I am concerned, 'anybody' is better than the curren rascal in the Oval Office, ignorant by choice, hence, malevolous, and cruel to no measure towards 'the other'.",

No matter who, if a democrat wins, the right will circle the wagons and jump up and down and yell, and maybe even get out their guns.  The democratic party is viewed by the Trump base as unamerican, traitorous, dangerous, and undemocratic.  They don't see a fine line between Klobuchar and Warren--for them, these Senators are both communists.\n\nAs to point two, it is possible to remember that unions and organized labor were once viewed as a threat to capitalism, and, with Reagan's support, they were decimated.  The happy result is that workers are poorer and working more than one job, and have no pensions.  Yippeee for Capitalism, it works so well!!!  It's time for the pendulum to swing the other way, the wanton abuse needs to be ended, and the very rich won't stop themselves.\n\nAS to point one, the main things he has done, is to support a nation in which one half hates the other.  The other big thing is the tacit support of bullying in all forms as a path to American prowess.   The general international consensus towards the US now is disdain.  Yup, we are overstating what Trump has done when we say he has taken the nation down from its place of enviability to one of disdain.  Let's have more of this.\n\nI really respect the arguments and intelligence of conservatives, but finding ways to think that a democrat could be as bad or worse than trump is a waste of energy and time.",

They want Sanders to burn down the house, take over, and install a new doctrine, sound familiar?.  Feel the Bern, they say,  MAGA says Trump.  The young are understandably attracted to Sander's utopia as they have never been disappointed by one.  Fortunately, more of us know radicalism when we see it, and since there are no more moderate Republicans, its up to us to not let the center collapse.  History is littered with those disastrous consequences.  Sanders hates the rich corporations.  To him, they are all evil.  He sees everything in absolutes.  Stephens makes the point that Sanders and Trump are two sides of the same coin, and Warren is Sanders light.  The result, Outrage!!  We're not radical, we're just trying to be like Europe!  Cover it in honey, and it all goes down easier.  Guess what, NATO is scared of you.

While \"Trumpism\" is \u201cmorally corrosive and corrupting\" more than \"politically or economically catastrophic,\" allowing it continue unchecked risks major international disaster, economic implosion, and/or social upheaval, and Trump is the least qualified and desirable of 2020 presidential candidates for dealing with such unforeseen but not unlikely new challenges. Allowing Trump to stay in high office is as unnecessary, reckless, foolish and unconscionable as was allowing him to gain that position in the first place.\n\n2. This piece, like 95% of press coverage of Trump, commits the cardinal sin of defacto assuming/pretending that he is some anomalous and unforeseeable \u201cblack swan\u201d which flew in out of the blue, and took over by unknowable magic. In reality, both political parties had many good opportunities to stop this, blew them outrageously, and have been covering it up by blaming each other, while the press almost completely ignores this monstrous deceit. Candidates Sanders and Warren take this reality seriously, they have credible plans to fix it, and that is why if the American electorate is clearheaded it will elect one of them.\n\n3. A useful contribution of this piece: The here stated cost of a Warren or Sanders policy package looks like bunk: But both candidates need to step up with more careful and deliberate estimates and explanations of such costs.",

Of course in this case he's joining the establishment assault, and employing all their usual tropes, against Sanders and Warren, the only candidates who really want to change anything. He accuses them of the radicalism of not wanting to find common ground with Republican voters, whose leaders have perfected the art of refusing to even consider compromise. So basically, Stephens is for the fracking industry and the health insurance industry, the latter of which adds nothing of value to our health care system but siphons off hundreds of billions of dollars in unnecessary overhead per year while killing tens of thousands annually. What Stephens says he really fears is the \"assault on American capitalism\", adhering to the fantastical notion that the version of capitalism we currently practice serves anyone well except a fraction of one percent of the population. This is nothing more than gaslighting clothed as an even-handed, pragmatic approach - a pragmatism which can lead only to the continued destruction of this nation and the entire planet.",

            "comment_body": "To say that Trump hasn't changed much politically or economically for the majority of Americans reminds me of an old joke: A man jumps out of a 53rd story window. Someone shouts to him from a 30th story window, asking him how he is doing. The falling man responds, 'So far, so good.' In other words Stephens largely avoids looking at the possible consequences of a second term. Next, the US doesn't work on a parliamentary system. Electing Sanders far from assures his policies get enacted, or enacted as he envisages. This outcome seldom happens in the US. Lastly, careful when you quote research done by 'think tanks' like the Manhattan Institute. These outfits tend to do more marketing and less thinking. I could easily find an analysis from a left leaning institute that would counter the outcome of the research done by the right leaning Manhattan Institute. I couldn't have predicted the precise numbers of that study, but I could have easily predicted the proposed outcome. Without being convinced of Sanders methods for achieving his proposed outcome, I can still strongly doubt that his presidency would be a disaster. I'm much more willing to attach that to another four year of Trump (assuming he would be willing to leave after another four years). Conclusion: Any Democrat is better than Trump. (Don't forget Stephens does support Trump's judicial appointments plus the economically unfounded faith in the efficacy of tax cuts. I assume that helps to color his evaluation.)",

This is not a difference of policy, but a different  understanding of the rule of law and the constitutional principles that make America what it is.  \n\nStephen's position looks to me like a more sophisticated version of something I hear from some conservative friends:  Yes, there is much wrong with Trump's governance....  but look at his judicial appointments!

Priorities will need to be set, and step-by-step approaches articulated.\n\nBut since the sanity caucus appears to be shrinking, the logic of the situation needs to be explored. What is needed is a candidate who embraces the Sanders/Warren stance as setting out valid aspirational goals, but who also can provide a practical roadmap for moving forward in a responsible and minimally disruptive way. \n\nThe poster child for this problem is of course universal healthcare. It may embody a desirable objective, but the reality is that the first actual attainable steps are likely to be plugging the holes in Obamacare created by Republicans. \n\nThe answer is either for Sanders or Warren to embrace a greater level of pragmatism about the stages required to achieve their long term goals, or for a centrist to embrace those same goals but focus on the less daunting first steps in the process. The latter option seems more likely to occur. So we need a moderate whose commitment to the ultimate vision is credible enough to pull in voters further to the left.\n\nThe wild card here is climate change, one topic where aggressive approaches cannot be deferred. Can we find a moderate who is radical on climate change?",

It seems to be a feeling that if the right wing can do it so can they. I would rather not see any of these types emboldened. There's a much bigger group on the right that also appear to be threatening violence. And of the recent terrorist mass shootings, homegrown type, all have been right-wing inspired.  Polarization is dangerous.  Would Trump or any Dem president decrease polarization?  My money's on the Blue, but, but I wouldn't bet the farm.",

So why the existential angst, Bret.\n\nIn spite of the intellectual muddle of most of the column, Stephens makes a valid point in the middle when, almost off-handedly, he writes, \"The truth of Trumpism is that it\u2019s a morally corrosive and corrupting force, not a politically or economically catastrophic one. It\u2019s a reality Trump\u2019s critics need to internalize lest their criticism become a self-defeating caricature.\" This is something those who oppose Trump need to take seriously, if he is not to have four more years to corrupt our country.\n\nA broader perspective on relevant dynamics is in David Brooks' current column, where he describes  the punditocracy's myopia blocking out the gap between the current iteration of the working class and those who speak in their name\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/opinion/joe-biden-2020.html#commentsContainer&permid=104787396:104787396\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/opinion/joe-biden-2020.html#commentsContainer&permid=104787396:104787396</a>",

Trump is certainly no LBJ but neither are Sanders or Warren.

They are always asking how much would the federal government have to raise taxes to pay for such & such a program.\n\nThe idea that the federal gov has to pay for things, good & bad, with taxes or borrowing is just plain wrong. The gov doesn't need your money. It can (thru the FED) create as much as it needs out of thin air. Just think about where money you pay your taxes with came from in the first place. Unless you have a printing press in your basement, it originally came from the federal gov. \n\nOf course, creating money has consequences, but that is entirely a different question. If the program greatly facilitates production, that will hold down prices. If we need to increase taxes at all, it may well be far less than $X. \n\nI don't know if Bernie understands this, but it seems he is perfectly willing to propose programs without worrying about taxes. In addition, he has advisors (e,g, Stephanie Kelton) who do understand how the federal gov works. I don't see any such at the Manhattan Institute. \n\nA reader from Boston called max neatly summed it up: \n\n\"So many of our economic issues could be solved if people understood that the US cannot run out of money, and how hard it is to cause hyperinflation from gov spending alone.\"",

Our democracy is being disassembled.  Our environmental laws are being gutted.  Civil Rights are endangered.  These are policies supported by GOP Senators who were in reckless Rupert-Murdoch-world mode way before Trump appeared.  They voted (how many times?) to take away pre-existing conditions protections from millions of American breast cancer survivors - and therefore the health care they depend on to live.\n\nOn the other hand, Democratic Senators have maintained a dedication to civility and bipartisanship (despite McConnell's vile blockage of the advise and consent role of the Senate, in his successful coup blocking a moderate Supreme Court nominee.) Unlike the GOP - half yahoos, half cowards, and all marching in cult-like conformity, the Democrats on the other hand will be deliberative, responsible, and willing to challenge any President.  I'm certain - and hopeful - that some of Warren's policies that you fear will be amended and modified, but also advanced by a thoughtful Democratic Congress.  That's the way the system works when it isn't being run like a madhouse.  Reckless only happens when you have Republicans revering Putin.  Thankfully, my Democratic Party still adheres to the sage wisdom of Will Rogers:  \"I am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat.\"",

But he seems to be unrealistic in his belief that we can achieve it immediately.\n\nYou can't just extend health care to millions of uninsured immediately without creating shortages.  First you have to train the doctors.\n\nA few years ago, I asked myself the question:  Why do medical costs in the US keep going up?\n\nI remembered the Econ 101 law of supply and demand.  You keep medical costs down by training enough doctors.\n\nThere have been articles and articles written by economists on how illegal immigration decreases the wages of unskilled workers (as George Borjas of Harvard argues) or they do not.\n\nBut perhaps a more important issue is that since 1986, the population of the US has increased by 36% while the rate of production of doctors from medical schools has gone up at about half that rate.\n\nThus population growth driven by immigration is most likely partly responsible for exploding health care costs.\n\nA plan for universal health care would start by giving excellent high school students scholarships to attend universities, fellowships for medical schools and residency, with an agreement to come back to their communities and provide medical services.\n\nWhy haven't Sanders or Warren included such a proposal in their plans?\n\nThe devil is in the details, and both of these candidates do not seem to publicize the details, if indeed they have thought about them.",
