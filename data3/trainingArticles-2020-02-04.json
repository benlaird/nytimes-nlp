            "full_text": " Iowa\u2019s Unholy Mess The stakes are too high to begin \nlike this. By Frank Bruni Opinion Columnist Is Iowa a metaphor? A harbinger? \nEither way it\u2019s a mess \u2014 and not the way any Democrat wanted the party\u2019s voting \nto begin in an election year with stratospheric stakes. To excite the most \nAmericans possible and have its best chance of toppling President Trump, the \nDemocratic Party needs a sorting of candidates that\u2019s coherent, a system that \ninspires faith, a process that makes participants feel respected and heard. Iowa\n provided none of that on Monday night. Instead it staged a baffling spectacle \nresistant to any timely, definitive verdict. More than 18 hours after the \nactual, physical caucusing at hundreds of locations across the state had \nfinished, there were still no official results, just resentments, recriminations\n and reports that a newly intricate manner of counting had proven laborious, a \nnewly developed app for it hadn\u2019t worked as planned, a backup phone line had \njammed and the campaigns had been asked to join a pair of emergency conference \ncalls with state Democratic officials. Maybe there\u2019s a moral here about dreaming\n too big and reaching too high. Maybe there\u2019s just a terrifying repeat of the \nparty\u2019s awful luck in 2016. The candidates were stunned. Their aides were livid.\n And Democrats nationwide, so hungry for the first signs of resolution in a \nprimary with so many competitive candidates, waited and waited late into the \nnight on Monday and surely, in most cases, gave up and went to bed. Not me. I \nwas too aghast, agitated and curious to see how soon Trump and his enablers \nwould exploit this turn of events. The inevitable answer: right away. Brad \nParscale, the president\u2019s campaign manager, sent a tweet out before midnight \nEastern time on Monday. \u201cDemocrat party meltdown,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey can\u2019t even \nrun a caucus and they want to run the government. No thank you.\u201d Lovely \u2014 and \nnot the last of it. Trump quickly amplified the gloating and taunting, which, \nafter golf, are his favorite sports. On Tuesday morning he tweeted: \u201cThe \nDemocrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran \nthe Country.\u201d Donald Trump Jr. used his own Twitter account to spread a \nconspiracy theory about a fraudulent outcome and sniped that \u201cthere\u2019s no \nquestion anymore that the greatest threat to US Elections is in fact Democrat \nincompetence.\u201d The Trumps, Parscale and the rest of their wretched gang will \nfold what happened in Iowa into their persistent narrative: Democrats are \nhapless, and the traditions and institutions that Americans are asked to trust \ndon\u2019t deserve that deference. Iowa is a prompt for cynicism. Cynicism is \nPresident Trump\u2019s lifeblood. As predictable as Parscale\u2019s tweet were formal \ncomplaints about the credibility of the vote count from Democrats worried about \ntheir showing in the caucuses. One came from Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, which argued \nthat \u201cconsiderable flaws\u201d should be examined and addressed before any results \nwere accepted. And so the victor in Iowa may be denied his or her full measure \nof credit and exultation, the losers may be spared some of the usual damage and \none or more of the candidates and his or her supporters may question the \nfairness and legitimacy of how the entire Democratic primary plays out. It\u2019s \n2016 all over again. Wasn\u2019t the party supposed to learn from its mistakes? \nThere\u2019s no excuse for this, not given how long the Iowa Democratic Party had to \nprepare, not given the privilege of the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation status, not \ngiven how deeply invested tens of millions of distraught Americans are in the \neffort to get rid of an unfit, amoral president. That effort can\u2019t start like \nthis. The debacle was a specific betrayal of Iowa\u2019s voters. I spent most of the \npast week in Iowa, where I was wowed and moved by how much thought Iowans were \nputting into which candidate they\u2019d caucus for. They made clear that they saw \nTrump as an existential threat. So they weren\u2019t merely deciding on a favorite \ncandidate. They were anointing a savior and anxiously unsure about who \nrepresented the surest and best hope. I\u2019d never seen voters so twisted into \nknots. I\u2019d never seen pundits so perplexed by the tea leaves in front of them \nand so hesitant to play fortuneteller. I\u2019d never been so stymied for insight, so\n barren of instinct. This wasn\u2019t a political contest; it was a kidney stone. And\n by late Tuesday afternoon, it still hadn\u2019t passed. The candidates, too, were \nbetrayed, cruelly and destructively so. They tried to work around the crazy \nambiguity, delivering remarks to their supporters that neither declared victory \nnor conceded defeat, because no one was yet victorious and no one yet defeated \u2014\n not officially. \u201cSomehow, some way, I\u2019m going to get on a plane tonight to New \nHampshire,\u201d Amy Klobuchar told the crowd at her election-night party, and that \n\u201csomehow, some way\u201d was a nod to the surreal limbo in which the candidates \nlanguished. \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk out of here with our share of delegates,\u201d Biden\n told the crowd at his election-night party. It was a safe statement, because it\n was an utterly and necessarily vacuous one. Bernie Sanders matched it: \u201cI have \na strong feeling that at some point, the results will be announced.\u201d As the \nhours ticked by, the Iowa Democratic Party released a statement saying that the \ndelay was attributable to their diligence in resolving inconsistencies and that \nthere was \u201cnot a hack or an intrusion\u201d that should stoke doubts about the \neventual vote tally. But doubts had already been stoked. They\u2019ll probably never \ngo fully away. And in an era when \u201crigged\u201d and \u201choax\u201d are the actual mantras of \nthe American president, they\u2019re devastating. They\u2019re unaffordable. Pete \nButtigieg spoke later than other candidates and seemed to have information that \nconvinced him that he\u2019d finished at or near the top. \u201cAn improbable hope became \nan undeniable reality,\u201d he said, referring to the long odds against a 38-year-\nold, openly gay man rising this high in the Democratic primary. He gave a shout-\nout to \u201cthe love of my life,\u201d his husband, Chasten. That moment was historic. \nBut would it be remembered instead as premature and overconfident? Thanks, Iowa,\n for the clarity on that. Way to get the ball rolling. ",

            "full_text": " I Feel Personally Judged by J. Lo\u2019s Body Are we \nreally supposed to look this good at 50 now? By Jennifer Weiner Contributing \nOpinion Writer Most mornings, things are pretty chill on my Facebook feed. \nThere\u2019s the ongoing simmering outrage about the current administration \ninterspersed with posts about kids, about books, about yoga. Someone\u2019s posting a\n pair of dresses and asking her friends to vote; someone\u2019s sharing a video of \nher child at the high-school talent show. Typical middle-age mom stuff. But on \nMonday morning, I woke up to major mom drama. My Facebook community was \nconvulsed in a take-no-prisoners battle, a war being waged on the tanned, taut \nterrain of Jennifer Lopez\u2019s body. Yes, she shared the bill with the 43-year-old \nShakira, but the most intense debate was all about the seven-years-older Jenny \nFrom the Block. In this corner: the women who found J. Lo\u2019s Super Bowl high-\nenergy hit mash-up unnecessarily salacious, designed to titillate male viewers, \nperformed for the male gaze. \u201cSponsored by Pornhub,\u201d sniffed one. \u201cTrashy,\u201d said\n another. Why did there have to be a stripper pole, and why couldn\u2019t she have \nworn more clothes? Call them the Pearl Clutchers. In the opposing corner: the \nwomen who found the show inspiring, a stirring political statement, a \ndemonstration of Puerto Rican pride and also what a woman\u2019s body can do, given \nthe right combination of genetics, effort, discipline and money. Call them Team \nRump Shakers. Whether women singing and dancing in barely there costumes or \notherwise celebrating their bodies is empowering, or an assault on our ability \nto move through the world as men\u2019s equals, is one of those forever fights that \nflares up whenever sex workers\u2019 rights or pornography are debated or Emily \nRatajkowski posts a topless selfie. What gave this iteration its special sauce, \nhowever, was the age of the woman at its center. If there was one thing the \nShakers and the Clutchers could agree on, it\u2019s that Jennifer Lopez looks \namazing. At 50, she is a force of nature, a woman who looks so amazing it\u2019s like\n evolution took a tiny step forward, just for her. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s 50 and\n looks so good!\u201d women said. Which quickly became, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m 50 and I\n look so bad!\u201d (\u201cAside from making me feel physically deformed, that half-time \nshow was 100!\u201d wrote the Sports Illustrated editor Sarah Kwak.) Some members of \nmy social-media community were in awe. Others \u2014 myself included \u2014 were feeling \npersonally judged. I\u2019m just a few months younger than J. Lo, and, with every \nbirthday, I have asked: Is this the year it ends? Surely there\u2019s a finish line; \na point we\u2019ll reach when the You Must Be This Hot in Order to Participate sign \nat the amusement park ride disappears, and we all get a seat on the roller \ncoaster (right alongside the lumpy, balding, graying, potbellied men who\u2019ve been\n riding the entire time). That\u2019s what I always imagined. But I also thought that\n pregnancy would be a nine-month time out from competing in the Looking Good \nOlympics. Alas, I had my daughters in the heyday of the Hot Mom, an era where \nbillowy maternity garments gave way to bump-hugging body-con styles, where \ncelebrities left the hospitals holding their newborns, wearing their skinny \njeans. No respite there. Forty was clearly too soon to surrender, given Halle \nBerry and Jennifer Aniston, Brooke Shields and Lisa Bonet, not to mention those \nubiquitous lists of 10 Celebrities Who Are Unrecognizable Today (You Won\u2019t \nBelieve Number 8!) that popped up every time I went online and told me that \ngaining weight and aging visibly were a fast road to irrelevance and mockery. \nStill, I\u2019d been picturing 50 as the year when I\u2019d be done. I\u2019d quit dyeing my \nhair and donate my high heels; I\u2019d greet the occasional chin hair with a \nBuddhist master\u2019s zen and treat my body like a place I could exist without \napology instead of something akin to a seedy apartment complex, a place I needed\n to constantly manage and improve, with unruly bits to be waxed and plucked, \npainted and dyed, trussed in spandex and lifted with underwire. I have always \ntried to tell myself that celebrity bodies are a little like art galleries. I \ncan appreciate and be inspired by their beauty. I can acknowledge the time and \nmoney that went into their creation. When I\u2019ve finished looking, I can go home, \nsecure in the knowledge that nobody expects my living room to look like that. \nThen I saw the meme that made the rounds on Monday. \u201c50 Years Old in 1985,\u201d read\n one side, with a shot of Rue McClanahan from \u201cGolden Girls,\u201d in period-\nappropriate feathered hair and a dowdy-looking sweater. \u201c50 Years Old in 2020,\u201d \nread the other side, with Jennifer Lopez in a silver bodysuit, toned thighs \ngripping the pole, honeyed locks streaming, and bronzed skin gleaming, looking \nimpossibly \u2026 impossible. If Blanche Devereaux is now, through some cruel twist \nof the worst timeline, on the Not side of Hot or Not, I guess Dorothy Zbornak is\n completely out of the question. And Dorothy had been my plan all along! The \nanswer, I think, is to watch these types of performances like a man. Women watch\n a 15-minute show featuring elite entertainers and, in some cases, end up \nfeeling bad about ourselves. Men, meanwhile, watch a three-hour game, played by \nelite athletes with single-digit body fat, and most won\u2019t feel a single twinge \nof self-doubt, or miss a single chip from the nacho platter. Women see \ninspiration or goals we\u2019ve failed to attain or a pretty stick to beat ourselves \nup with. We hear a voice (sponsored by Weight Watchers and Revlon and Planet \nFitness and Jenny Craig) whispering This can be yours, if you just work hard \nenough. Men see entertainment, athletes who exist on a different plane than mere\n mortals. Their inner voice whispers, Are there any more nachos? I don\u2019t even \nthink it would occur to them to feel bad, or try to emulate what they saw. And \nso, my fellow Gen X ladies, if you want to be J. Lo, more power to you. If you \nwant to be Blanche, be Blanche. But if it\u2019s always been about Bea Arthur, come \nsit back here, with me, in your Eileen Fisher tunic and the newish bifocals you \nhaven\u2019t quite mastered. We\u2019ll wait till the crowd goes home, and we\u2019ll dance \nlike nobody\u2019s watching. Jennifer Weiner is a contributing opinion writer and the\n author, most recently, of \u201cMrs. Everything.\u201d ",

            "full_text": " Mother Nature Scoffs at Trump\u2019s Mideast Peace Plan \nClimate change and other conditions don\u2019t respect boundary lines. By Thomas L. \nFriedman Opinion Columnist TEL AVIV \u2014 To get a different perspective on the \nTrump-Kushner peace plan, I decided to call the best Middle East analyst I know.\n Her name is Mother Nature. So, Mother Nature, what did you think of the Deal of\n the Century? Well, Tom, not a lot. For starters, it mentioned me in only a few \nshort sentences. Let me take you on a tour of the neighborhood, as I see it. \nWarning: My maps have no boundary lines, no walls \u2014 and no Areas A, B and C in \nthe West Bank. You can be sure that President Trump, who has declared climate \nchange a hoax, has no idea that the Eastern Mediterranean has experienced \ndrought conditions for 15 of the last 20 years, which is unparalleled in the \nmodern historical record. A recent study by Tel Aviv University predicts that \nthe Eastern Mediterranean will get steadily hotter and drier and gradually lose \ntwo months of winter \u2014 i.e., rainfall months \u2014 within the next 25 years. \nMeanwhile, in 1948 Israel\u2019s population was 800,000. It\u2019s now 8.7 million. \nJordan\u2019s was 450,000. It\u2019s now 10 million. Syria\u2019s was three million, and it\u2019s \nnow 17.5 million. So, the future is steadily more people and less water. What \nare the implications? Israel used to pump up to 500 million cubic meters of \nwater a year out of the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake, to meet domestic \nneeds, including for agricultural fields in the south of Israel, to turn the \ndesert green. In 2018, Israel could pump out only 30 million cubic meters! In \nthe summer of 2018, the Sea of Galilee was so low from droughts and water \nwithdrawals for rising populations that it was threatening to become another \nsaline lake, like the Dead Sea. You remember that Jesus walked on water in the \nSea of Galilee? Well, you could have done that, too, because it was so low that \ntwo islands were visible in the middle of the lake. How does that affect the \nJordan River and all those dependent on it? Sadly, in the last 50 years, the \nJordan River\u2019s annual flow has dropped to a trickle. With Israel, Jordan and \nSyria each grabbing as much clean water as they can, it\u2019s actually mostly sewage\n that is keeping the river flowing today. But since a lot of the river is a \nclosed military zone, most people don\u2019t know it\u2019s drying up. The only guaranteed\n water for Israel\u2019s big urban centers and farms on its coastal plain is \ndesalinated water and treated wastewater, which have chemical issues. And now, \nin order to adapt to climate change, Israel is having to reverse the direction \nof its national water-transportation system \u2014 to take desalinated water from its\n coastal water plants up north to the Sea of Galilee, which, until sustained \nrainfall this winter began to replenish it, was so diminished it could not serve\n as Israel\u2019s national water tower. At the same time, Gaza does not have \nsufficient sewage treatment facilities, so roughly 100 million liters of raw \nsewage flows from Gaza every day into the Mediterranean. The prevailing current \ntakes it right up the coast, where Gaza\u2019s waste gets into the filters of \nIsrael\u2019s big Ashkelon desalination plant, which intermittently has had to be \nshut down to be unclogged. What about Gaza, Jordan and the West Bank? Well, \nAmman recently cut municipal water service from two days a week to eight hours a\n week for its residents. They have to buy the rest of their water from private \nvendors. Jordan has had to absorb 1.5 million refugees from Syria\u2019s civil war, \nwhich itself was partly prompted by drought. The Jordanian people should get the\n Nobel Peace Prize for how they have peacefully absorbed so many refugees. \nJordan has 600,000 people living on its side of the Jordan Valley. With markets \nto Iraq and Syria both disrupted, and a decrease in water supply as a result of \ndrought, youth unemployment on the Jordanian side of the valley is at 40 \npercent. The water-intensive crops they, and the Israelis, grow in the valley \u2014 \ntropical and subtropical fruits, like bananas and citrus, and fruits and \nvegetables for export \u2014 are not sustainable. The conditions have left most of \nthese communities impoverished. How has this affected the war on terrorism? \nJordan was the third-largest contributor of youth recruits to ISIS in the Arab \nworld. You can be sure plenty of these recruits were from the Jordan Valley, \nwhich is full of frustrated young men who can\u2019t get jobs and so can\u2019t marry. \nIt\u2019s a trifecta of ecological demise, poverty and radicalization. What about \nGaza under Hamas? Both Israel and Gaza traditionally drew most of their water \nfrom the coastal aquifer. The Gaza portion has totally collapsed under Hamas \nmismanagement, Israeli blockades and overuse. Some 97 percent of the Gaza \naquifer is no longer potable. People there live by filling jerrycans with water \nfrom small desalination plants run by private vendors and international \norganizations. About a quarter of the disease in Gaza today is associated with \nunhealthy drinking water. The mountain aquifer running down the spine of the \nWest Bank and Israel is also being rapidly depleted and polluted. The Jewish \nsettlers in the West Bank are connected to the Israeli water system through a \nsophisticated network that runs 24/7, but the Palestinian cities are not. So, in\n hot summer months in Bethlehem, for instance, residents get municipal water \nonly episodically. You also have many West Bank Palestinian villages and towns \nwithout sewage treatment facilities. Their raw sewage is tossed into cesspits \u2014 \nunlined holes in the ground \u2014 that let the liquid seep into the groundwater and \nthe solids collect, to then be dumped into wadis. Sewage in the greater Hebron \narea, with over 300,000 people, flows via the Hebron Stream to the Israeli town \nof Beersheba, where it becomes the Beersheba Stream! As I said, I recognize no \nborders. So what would be Mother Nature\u2019s peace principles? To begin, any plan \nthat carves up the West Bank into siloed political spaces, walls and roads \u2014 \ndriven by a Trump-Kushner desire to embrace the \u201creality\u201d of where Jewish \nsettlers have haphazardly settled around the West Bank \u2014 makes no sense to me. \nThis is a single ecosystem, and there will be no physical security for one if \nthere is not human security for all. More than once my flash floods have knocked\n down Israel\u2019s security barrier around Tulkarm and Jerusalem. You have to start \nwith the right question: How do we bring peace to this region in an era of rapid\n population growth and climate change? Not: How do we bring peace to this region\n in a way that gives primacy to the demands of Israeli, Palestinian or \nevangelical Christian zealots? What would your map look like? Peace and \nprosperity came to Europe after World War II via the creation of the Common \nMarket. The Common Market was built on trading last century\u2019s main energy source\n and industrial product \u2014 coal and steel. Peace between Israelis and Jordanians \nand Palestinians will come through a confederation of their sovereign entities \nbased on sea and sun. The only way Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians will \nall have water and energy security is through large-scale desalination, and the \nonly way they can get that \u2014 and not worsen climate change \u2014 is through massive \nsolar-power generation. How might that work? Israel and Gaza have vast capacity \nto tap the Mediterranean Sea for manufactured water, and Jordan has great \ncapacity to tap its vast empty deserts for manufactured solar power. They all \nshould be networked into a confederation, harnessing the sea and sun \u2014 with \njoint commissions to manage water, energy and food security \u2014 that would create \nhealthy interdependencies. Then they could all rise economically together. \nRather than the siloed, unhealthy interdependency or unilateralism that they are\n now creating \u2014 where they compete for water, energy and food and pollute one \nanother, and fall together. For more on all of this, look at the work of the \norganization EcoPeace Middle East and particularly its feasibility study. That \ngroup understands me like nobody else. If you build on my formula, any peace \nwill have to involve mutual respect and respect for my ecosystems \u2014 in contrast \nto the zero-sum thinking of the political extremists now driving this story and \nmessing with Mother Nature. It\u2019s not smart to mess with Mother Nature. Ask the \nAustralians. ",

            "full_text": " Are You in a Gang Database? The bar for being labeled\n a gang member is low, and the consequences are serious. By Stefano Bloch Dr. \nBloch is an assistant professor at the University of Arizona. I found out I was \nin a gang database \u2014 a shared criminal intelligence system used by policing \nagencies to store information on identified gang members \u2014 in 1996 after a dozen\n members of the Los Angeles Police Department crashed through my front door. The\n officers were from an anti-gang and graffiti task force and the arrest warrant \nidentified me as a leader of not one, but two, graffiti gangs. When I found out \nthat officers had torn through my family\u2019s apartment looking for spray paint and\n markers as per the search warrant, it reminded me of the actual gang members \nwho had done the same just a few years earlier. As a local graffiti writer I had\n spent my adolescence running from gangs that resented how \u201ctaggers\u201d like me \nwrote in the neighborhoods they claimed as their own. Now I was labeled a gang \nmember. I had been labeled a gang member because I must have looked like one. Or\n it may have been because a judge is more likely to issue a warrant for a kid in\n a gang than a kid who writes on walls. I will never be sure. I was a vandal, \nbut I was not in a gang, and the legal consequences for each are vastly \ndifferent. At my arraignment, my \u201cgang\u201d identity was brought up to frame the \nmany charges for vandalism I was facing. Like the more than 94 percent of state-\nlevel felony defendants in America, I plea-bargained and received a fine, \nprobation and community service, but avoided jail time. It was the gang label, \nnot the criminal charges, that scared me most. I realized then, as I understand \nnow, that gang categorization is often more of a legal tactic than a matter of \nidentity. Recent accusations of Los Angeles Police Department officers falsely \nidentifying people as gang members are nothing new, and the problem is certainly\n not just a local issue. The Los Angeles Times reported last month that 20 \nofficers from the Metropolitan Division assigned to crime suppression duties \nwere suspected of having willfully falsified information on field interview \ncards during traffic stops. Information on such cards is relied upon later to \ndetermine who should be entered into a gang database. Self-identifying as a gang\n member, in addition to tattoos and officers\u2019 descriptions of \u201cgang related\u201d \nclothing, are used to make a gang distinction. Such gang member categorization \nsometimes based on superficial if not completely fabricated indicators is part \nof a longstanding campaign of deportation of young people supported at the \nfederal level, and increasingly so under the Trump administration. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security and a subsidiary agency, Immigration and Customs\n Enforcement, rely on gang databases that pull together local law enforcement \ndeterminations about gang membership. The Obama administration did the same. \nFrom Los Angeles to Long Island, where Operation Matador was announced in 2017 \nto target suspected members of La Mara Salvatrucha, or MS13, federal officials, \nwith the help of local police, have actively and often erroneously targeted \nimmigrant minors based on purported gang affiliation. The \u201cgang member\u201d label \nthat federal authorities have been gleaning from gang databases is not based on \nthe determination of a court, and is applied without due process. A local \nofficer\u2019s observation about attire, tattoos, affiliation or in my case, \nvandalism, can set a life-altering legal process in motion. While entry into a \ngang database alone does not automatically trigger deportation proceedings or \nincarceration, being identified as a gang member does embolden federal agents to\n selectively carry out deportation procedures and allows prosecutors to call for\n sentence enhancements. In Los Angeles, such gang categorization has gone on \nsince a year before the passage of the Street Terrorism Enforcement and \nPrevention (STEP) Act in 1988. The legislation sought to reduce gang-related \nviolence through targeted anti-gang policing. But a lot has changed since three \ndecades ago when there was an all-time highs in crime across the city. According\n to the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s website, the criteria used to determine \none\u2019s gang identity today can include \u201cfingernails painted a certain color, \ncertain undergarments \u2026 and specific hairstyles,\u201d in addition to wearing jewelry\n that is \u201cexpensive or cheap,\u201d or shirts that are \u201cworn loosely and untucked.\u201d \nIn 2016, an audit by the California State Auditor of CalGang, a database used to\n keep track of gang members across California, revealed that the system even \nincluded 42 \u201cgang members\u201d under the age of one. According to the justification \nentered into CalGang by law enforcement officers, 28 of these babies had \n\u201cadmitted to being gang members.\u201d Classification mistakes like this are \ncertainly costly, especially for those without the benefits of citizenship. \nAttorneys surveyed by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in 2018, reported \u201cthe\n increased use of gang allegations in adjudications involving cases of immigrant\n youth seeking protection through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \n(DACA).\u201d In 2019, the matter of misidentification became more widely known after\n a mother brought her case to the attention of the L.A.P.D. A supervisor looked \nback at body camera footage that supported her claim that her son had been \nfalsely categorized as a gang member. People in minority communities have been \nmisidentified as gang members for years, but until recently, individuals on \nCalGang were not notified of the designation. Neither were the parents of \nminors. Many people who were added before Jan. 1, 2017 still do not realize they\n are in a gang database until they reach a criminal or immigration judge or are \nconsidered for a job in government. Most other state gang databases do not \nrequire notification. Although it happened to me personally, it was not until I \nhad earned my Ph.D and began researching the insidious forms of gang abatement \nand the legality of anti-gang policing that I realized how low the bar was for \nbeing labeled a gang member, and how high the stakes could be. The allegations \nagainst officers out of the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s elite Metro Division\n concerning \u201cgang framing\u201d are troubling. Not only because, as the department\u2019s \nchief, Michel Moore, puts it, \u201cfalsifying information on a department report is \na crime,\u201d but because such crimes of misidentification have been going on for \nyears with untold consequences. Stefano Bloch, an assistant professor at the \nUniversity of Arizona, is the author of \u201cGoing All City: Struggle and Survival \nin L.A.\u2019s Graffiti Subculture.\u201d ",

            "full_text": " The Center Cannot Hold Bernie Sanders\u2019s strong \nshowing in Iowa is a turning point in the battle between the party\u2019s \nestablishment and left wing. By Elizabeth Bruenig Ms. Bruenig is an Opinion \nwriter. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in mid-January, Hillary \nClinton said she considered Bernie Sanders unaccomplished and unlikable, with \nfew friends on Capitol Hill. Then, last Friday, as though sensing the \ncontroversy generated by her remarks had faded all too quickly, Mrs. Clinton \nappeared on the liberal-minded podcast \u201cYour Primary Playlist\u201d to accuse Senator\n Sanders of failing to do enough to unite the party behind her candidacy after \nher primary win in 2016. Mrs. Clinton was not alone in her apparently rising \nanxiety. Near the end of last month, the centrist think tank Third Way released \na memo all but begging Iowans not to vote for Mr. Sanders. The former Democratic\n nominee John Kerry was reportedly overheard on Sunday contemplating several \nstrategies to stop Mr. Sanders from taking the nomination. Meanwhile, Democratic\n National Committee members are considering shifts in convention rules tailored \nto hobble Mr. Sanders\u2019s chances. It is fair to conclude that the Democratic \nParty\u2019s center is panicking, and it is now fair to conclude that it has good \ncause: With 62 percent of Iowa caucus results in, Mr. Sanders leads the popular \nvote, with 26.3 percent. He trails former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, \nInd., in state delegates by a slim margin. But with Mr. Buttigieg struggling in \nprimary polls in New Hampshire and Nevada, it seems unlikely his campaign has \nthe kind of momentum that could lead to the nomination. Thus, the greater Iowa \nupset is that heir apparent Vice President Joe Biden is a distant fourth. With \nMr. Biden\u2019s front-runner status compromised, Mr. Sanders emerges from Iowa as a \nformidable candidate \u2014 without establishment imprimatur. Mr. Sanders leads the \npopular vote in Iowa not because he is favored by entrenched powers within the \nDemocratic Party or because he has institutional support in the form of steady \ncontributions from policy-minting think tanks, big donors or major political \npundits. On the contrary, Mr. Sanders leads the popular vote despite lacking all\n of those mainstays of traditional electoral success, and in defiance of a \nvigorous tide of establishment attacks. And he leads amid an incompetently \nexecuted caucus process that delayed results and robbed him of a traditional \nwinner\u2019s news cycle. Mr. Sanders\u2019s strong showing is no guarantee that he will \nwin the nomination. But it is a powerful repudiation of establishment hegemony \u2014\n and an inflection point in the battle between the party\u2019s center and left wing.\n Shortly before the caucuses, Michael Kazin, a professor of history at \nGeorgetown University and co-editor of the left-leaning journal Dissent, told me\n that a Sanders nomination would be very significant. \u201cHe\u2019d be the most radical \ncandidate, in many ways, in American history, not just for Democrats, but for \nany party,\u201d Professor Kazin said. Mr. Sanders\u2019s radicalism, Professor Kazin \nspeculated, is troubling to establishment Democrats for a variety of reasons, \nfrom worries about his strength against President Trump in the general election \nto a desire to find a candidate who can unite the party. Both of those concerns \nseem surmountable to me. But the one unsurmountable establishment fear \nsurrounding a Sanders win is something more like naked self-interest, and its \nattachment to power. Joe Biden was perhaps the closest candidate the party\u2019s \nestablishment had to a sure thing in the 2020 election, and he has run on the \npremise that he alone can defeat Mr. Trump, even though the latest head-to-head \nmatchup shows Mr. Biden performing about the same as Mr. Sanders against Mr. \nTrump. Mr. Biden has run before and lost before, and despite early leads in \nseveral important primary polls, he has begun to slip in key states, including \nPennsylvania. Worse, Mr. Biden has become entangled in the impeachment \nproceedings against Mr. Trump, with Senator Joni Ernst floating the idea of \ninstigating an investigation into the Biden family\u2019s dealings in Ukraine. Part \nof Mr. Sanders\u2019s resilience against centrist attacks stems from his grass-roots \nmovement of small donors, organizers and vocal supporters. If party leaders \nopenly assail him, they risk alienating Sanders loyalists, only 53 percent of \nwhom say they will certainly support the Democratic nominee if it isn\u2019t him. The\n problems at the Iowa caucus have instilled even more rancor and suspicion \nregarding Democratic institutions among his base. Establishment attacks on \nSanders \u2014 especially if effective \u2014 could result in Mr. Sanders\u2019s base simply \nstaying home in the general election. Yet if Mr. Sanders\u2019s rise continues \nunimpeded, the party may risk demoralizing fiscally conservative Democrats, \nthough those voters may be more likely to support a Democrat in the general \nelection no matter what than Mr. Sanders\u2019s passionate backers. If they attack \nMr. Sanders, \u201cthey\u2019re going to get a massive backlash, but if they don\u2019t, then \nthey\u2019re going to lose the center of the party,\u201d Jefferson Cowie, a historian of \nAmerican class politics at Vanderbilt University, told me recently. \u201cIt\u2019s a very\n volatile moment, I think, in the party\u2019s history.\u201d But the threat Mr. Sanders \nposes to centrist control over the party apparatus seems to be the most serious \nrisk of all, at least as far as party insiders are concerned. \u201cIf he won the \nnomination, I think obviously he would take over the party,\u201d Professor Kazin \nsaid. \u201cWhen you get the nomination, you usually get to name a new chair of the \nD.N.C., for example. And every congressional candidate would either have to get \non board with his politics, more or less, or at least make peace with him.\u201d A \nSanders White House would likely also produce much less demand for the center-\nleft policymaking institutions that dominate Washington. \u201cThat\u2019s the change, I \nthink, that would be quite radical and amazing,\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager,\n Faiz Shakir, told me over a recent lunch. \u201cYou\u2019d have to compel and force \ninstitutional structures to start to bend to an agenda that they have long \nforgotten or discarded.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019d have to have people doing analyses of \nMedicare for All, what the benefits of cost savings would be for families \u2014 \nthings that could have and should have been done, but haven\u2019t really ever been \ndone on a sophisticated major national scale.\u201d So the Democratic establishment \nhas its reasons for opposing Mr. Sanders. And though Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has \novercome a bracing bout of what Mr. Shakir calls \u201celite headwinds,\u201d it still \nfaces barriers. Mr. Sanders\u2019s embrace of democratic socialism will likely be an \nitem of anxiety for many voters. But if 2020 continues to signal a repudiation \nof establishment politics and norms, the socialist stigma may be weaker than we \nthink. Recent polling from the Pew Foundation shows that, while Republicans are \noverwhelmingly opposed to socialism, 65 percent of Democrats feel either \nsomewhat or very positively about socialism (55 percent say the same about \ncapitalism). It may be that socialism is less disturbing to voters on the fence \nthan Mr. Trump\u2019s manifest deficits, or it may be that the label itself has lost \nsome of its Cold War infamy. Or it may be that, whatever voters think of \ndemocratic socialism, they understand that it signifies a departure from \nDemocratic politics as usual. It is difficult to see a robust centrist victory \nin the months ahead. Supposing Mr. Sanders follows Iowa with a win in New \nHampshire on Feb. 11 \u2014 as polling forecasts \u2014 then his campaign will have \nachieved heady momentum. Mr. Biden may hope to eke out a lead through success in\n Southern primaries and tweaks to convention rules, but Mr. Sanders is picking \nup steam in South Carolina, and these 11th-hour D.N.C. machinations reek of \ndesperation. A narrow win under dubious conditions is no victory for the center,\n and augurs doom even as it delays it. Matt Bennett, vice president of Third \nWay, has expressed deep worries about Sanders. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t stand by while \nthere\u2019s a threat that Democrats could nominate a guy who would hand such \nnuclear-level ammunition to the Trump campaign,\u201d Mr. Bennett recently told NBC \nNews. Meanwhile, the party\u2019s left wing seems \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 \nascendant. Still, Mr. Sanders insisted during a phone call days before the \ncaucuses: \u201cWe don\u2019t take anything for granted. We are taking on the entire \nestablishment. We\u2019re taking on the big money interests that control the economy.\n We\u2019re taking on Trump, we\u2019re taking on the Republican Party, we\u2019re taking on \nthe Democratic establishment, so we take nothing for granted.\u201d Elizabeth Bruenig\n (@ebruenig) is an Opinion writer.

            "full_text": " Sorry, Republicans Rule the Internet Right now, being\n the best internet arsonist is what counts. By Kara Swisher Ms. Swisher covers \ntechnology and is a contributing opinion writer. Is there an app for that? \nApparently not for the Iowa Democratic caucuses, which is now red-faced over \nwhat appears to be an inept rollout of new technology to help precincts report \nthe results of the voting on Monday. Who won? Who knows? Which is not exactly \nhow the Democrats want to start off these critical primaries. This looks more \nlike my octogenarian mom when her New York Post app does not load correctly than\n a political party leaning into the future. This reminds me of another \nDemocratic tech snafu: the debut of the glitch-laden and over-budget Obamacare \nwebsite, technically called HealthCare.gov, in 2013. A nonpartisan report from \nthe Government Accountability Office later concluded that there was a lack of \n\u201ceffective planning and oversight practices\u201d in the development of the site. The\n primary season is a much larger beast, made more complex by the hyperpartisan \npolitical landscape, the breathless media environment in which cable TV hosts \nvamp for hours and, most of all, by social media, which on Monday immediately \nstirred itself into a frenzy. There was the hashtag #MayorCheat, alleging links \nbetween Pete Buttigieg and the company that built the app for the caucuses, \nShadow \u2014 Could it have a worse name? No, it could not! \u2014 and also its funder, a \nDemocratic digital strategy operation called Acronym. There were the twins of \nconspiracy mongering \u2014 also known as the Trump sons, Eric and Don Jr. \u2014 along \nwith the Trump campaign head Brad Parscale shoving out a series of \nunsubstantiated rumors about rigged results. And bots, so many bots, making it \nall worse by turning the social media engagement into enragement. And, \ncertainly, there was also the possibility of hacking and possible foreign \ninfluence that hangs over our elections like a Putin stink bomb. Above all, \nthough, it appears that rank tech incompetence is at the bottom of the Iowa \ndebacle; I have seen enough Silicon Valley apps do similar belly flops to feel \nconfident that\u2019s what happened on Monday. As the Democrats sort out the problems\n \u2014 from bad mobile connectivity to an app that gives beta testing a bad name, to\n obvious human error caused by the confusion of using a new system \u2014 such \nineptitude is not a good look for the party. As the writer Maura Quint noted on \nTwitter: \u201cFeels like you can ask people to trust the process or you can name \nyour election companies Acronym and Shadow like they\u2019re rival gangs of \nsupervillains in a movie where Spiderman teams up with G.I. Joe to save \nManhattan, but you can\u2019t do both.\u201d This gets to the heart of a persistent myth: \nthat the Democrats are the party of the internet generation, intuitively \nembracing the whole app-tastic, A.I.-centered, who\u2019s-got-the-V.R.-headset future\n better than the Republicans. That fallacy was fueled, in part, by the use of \ndigital tools by Barack Obama\u2019s campaign in 2008 and the image of him as tech-\nforward, a guy who hung out with Silicon Valley leaders like the former Google \nchief executive Eric Schmidt. The truth is that Mr. Obama was only sort of \ntechie. More important, his administration did not challenge the industry in any\n significant way. In the Obama years, Silicon Valley consolidated its influence \nand centralized its power without oversight. In addition, the idea took hold \nthat the tech industry was full of liberals, when in fact it is more \nlibertarian-lite with a strong proclivity for an unusual combination of live-\nand-let-live social mores and \u201cdon\u2019t regulate my innovation or tax me\u201d business \nattitude. In fact, from the start of the internet age in the 1990s, the right \nhas been more clever than its rivals in exploiting ever-morphing tech to \ninfluence vast numbers of people with targeted messages. While it\u2019s hard to \nforget in the age of Fox News ubiquity, a couple of decades ago most of the \ntruly powerful media outlets were centrist (or slightly left of center), and \nmass-media broadcast technology was not readily available to the emerging \nconservative movement. Thus, these outsiders latched on to the web, which in \nmany cases meant they were among the first to effectively use highly targeted \nemail and search ads. Back in the early 2000s, people like the evangelical \npolitical strategist Ralph Reed showed us what was coming: campaigns that are \nfought and won online, and power shifting to those who know how to move the tech\n levers. Right now that\u2019s people like Mr. Parscale, whose tactic is to use the \nentire arsenal of weapons that companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have\n provided in the most creative and sometimes nefarious of ways. And, as loath as\n I am to say this, why shouldn\u2019t he create a raging digital fire of confusion \nand propaganda and microtargeted lies and truths if no one is making rules to \nstop him? It is not meant as a compliment, but right now being the best tech \narsonist is what rates. Meanwhile, as it all burns, the Democrats in Iowa are \nfiddling away on an app that can\u2019t tally what is a relatively simple set of \ndata. Long ago, during a debate about the Obamacare site mess and what it meant \nfor eventual online voting, I suggested to a panel of Washington power players \nthat maybe we get a start-up like Tinder to run the voting system, since it did \ncomplex matching calculations in real time. My comment was greeted by looks of \nhorror, with one panel member asking me why our democracy should rely on dating \napp technology. The answer was simple: because it works. ",

By Natalie Friedman \nDr. Friedman is the director of family engagement at Barnard College. \u201cI \nwouldn\u2019t normally call you, but my child is not good at advocating for herself.\u201d\n Working as dean and director of family engagement at Barnard College, I often \nhear this kind of claim. It\u2019s rarely true. In almost all cases, the parents and \nguardians who tell me this have, unknowingly, prevented their children from \nhandling their own affairs. I wish they would recognize this kind of \noverparenting for what it is: counterproductive. Research has linked \noverparenting to a wide range of negative outcomes, including low self-efficacy,\n depression, decreased school engagement and poor academic adjustment. Worst of \nall, acting as a go-between and swooping in to solve every minor problem can \nsignal to young people that their parents think they\u2019re incompetent and \nincapable of self-advocacy. Though 61 percent of American adults with children \nages 18-29 say parents are doing too much for their young adult offspring, just \n28 percent say they themselves are doing too much. It\u2019s hard for them to see how\n their own \u201chelping\u201d behaviors are harming their children. Those who intervene \nunnecessarily in the lives of their college-age children are typically aware of \n\u2014 and emphatically reject \u2014 being categorized as \u201chelicopter,\u201d \u201cbulldozer,\u201d \n\u201csnowplow\u201d or \u201clawn mower\u201d parents. That\u2019s probably O.K. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s \nmuch to be gained from assigning negative labels to moms and dads who need a bit\n of guidance on how to take a step back as their sons and daughters transition \ninto adulthood. I prefer to think of them as \u201cfix-it\u201d parents since their \nprimary, shared goal is to solve problems in order to protect their children \nfrom pain or discomfort. Their actions are motivated by love. Remembering these \naltruistic intentions helps me reach common ground with the parents who call the\n Office of Family Engagement to complain that their daughters are unable to \nregister for their preferred classes, are intimidated by their professors, are \nnot happy with the water pressure in the dorm showers, are worried their \nroommates don\u2019t like them or are dissatisfied with the food options on campus. I\n hear from dads as frequently as I hear from moms. The fathers who contact my \noffice have a tendency to infantilize their daughters and try to enforce their \nown \u201csolutions.\u201d When a student isn\u2019t able to register for a class because it\u2019s \nfull, for example, her exasperated father might call to inform me that the \nadministration needs to open more sections of the course so there will be an \nopen seat for his child. And when I explain that no one is available to teach an\n additional section, the common response from dads is, \u201cWell, then you need to \nhire more instructors.\u201d Moms usually take a more collaborative approach. In this\n same situation, a mother usually inquires about how similar issues have been \nhandled in the past. When I respond that most students simply register for the \nclass the next time it\u2019s offered, she will typically implore me to do everything\n in my power to facilitate a one-time exception and ask what she can do to help \nme make a spot available for her daughter. Some parents start right at the top. \nAfter one anxious dad contacted the college president\u2019s office to voice concerns\n that his daughter wasn\u2019t registered for the \u201cright classes,\u201d I followed up with\n the student directly. It turned out that she and her father weren\u2019t on the same\n page at all. Not only was she satisfied with her courses; she had no idea that \nher dad intended to intervene on her behalf \u2014 and she was mortified that he had \ndone so. Being embarrassed by parents who meddle in your affairs is a normal, \nhealthy response for a college student. I worry about the ones who have been \ntaught to be helpless. What will happen to them when their moms and dads are no \nlonger around to solve their problems? Fortunately, there are many ways to \nsupport young people as they learn to speak up for themselves, solve their own \nproblems and make important decisions. Here are a few: Encourage them to take \nsmall steps. If your student tells you something isn\u2019t going well \u2014 a roommate \nwho\u2019s abusing alcohol or drugs, a less-than-stellar exam grade \u2014 encourage the \nstudent to take a first step: Send an email to an adviser on campus, or tap in a\n phone reminder to call an appropriate person and set up an appointment. Help \nthem write \u201cscripts.\u201d If your student is scared to talk to a professor or feels \nintimidated by a dean, help write a \u201cscript\u201d for the occasion. Chances are \nyou\u2019ve had experience talking to your boss or manager, so tell your student what\n words to use. I tell students who have trouble talking with professors to write\n down a few sentences like, \u201cHi, Professor X, I\u2019m Sally, and I\u2019m in your intro \nto biology course. I wondered if I could speak with you about my midterm. I made\n a lot of mistakes, and I\u2019d like to understand how to do better next time.\u201d Ask \nyour student to write down your suggestions in a notebook or type them into a \nphone, somewhere your student won\u2019t forget to look right before stepping into a \nprofessor\u2019s office. Encourage them to follow up. Sometimes a student will work \nup the courage to find a professor, only to hear something disappointing: They \nare failing the course, or the next exam will count as their final grade, or \nthey can\u2019t possibly take a makeup exam after missing the first quiz. Some \nstudents will take this disappointing news and turn it inward, feeling terrible \nand using negative self-talk. (\u201cI\u2019m so bad at this subject, I should just drop \nout of school. I don\u2019t belong here.\u201d) If your student has a tendency to do this,\n help to reframe the disappointment as a learning opportunity: Your student \nshould follow up with an email or another visit to the professor with specific \nquestions like, \u201cWhat can I do to be better prepared for the next exam?\u201d or \u201cIf \nI can\u2019t make up this quiz, is there another way for me to try to understand the \nmaterial and raise my grade?\u201d Remind them to talk to more than one person. A \nprofessor, a friend or a teaching assistant might have one answer to a question,\n but others on campus might have advice of a different kind. Encourage your \nstudent to get to know other adults on campus who might be able to help navigate\n a less-than-ideal situation. Getting lots of information and input can help \nthem make better decisions. Remind them that learning to live with \ndisappointment is a facet of self-advocacy. Even students who are great at \nasking for what they need may not get the response they want. Remind them that \nthis is O.K.: Rejection is a part of life. Too many parents have a \u201cdon\u2019t-take-\nno-for-an-answer\u201d mind-set, and their children adopt the same attitude. This \napproach rarely works for self-advocacy. Remember that every conversation is a \ngive-and-take, and coming off as angry or inflexible is only going to create \ntension with the very people who are in a position to help. Students need to \nlearn when to accept \u201cno\u201d as the final answer and when it is appropriate to push\n back or ask more questions. With time, your student will become better at self-\nadvocacy \u2014 but only if you step back and let them practice. Natalie Friedman is \nthe director of family engagement at Barnard College. ",

            "full_text": " The App That Broke the Iowa Caucus Democrats \ndesperately need to win the internet to beat Trump. Their first big test was a \nmassive failure. By Charlie Warzel Mr. Warzel is an opinion writer at large. A \ntransformative piece of technology is supposed to \u201cdisrupt\u201d the unwieldy ways \nthat came before it. On Monday evening, an app built to deliver quicker caucus \nresults took the Silicon Valley term of art literally, contributing to massive \ndelays in reporting the results in Iowa. Hours after the caucuses ended, the \nstate Democratic Party, citing inconsistencies in the reporting data, still has \nnot publicly reported any results. It stressed there was no \u201chack or intrusion.\u201d\n Over the past hours a disheartening game of electoral tech support, conducted \nby journalists across the internet, has unfolded. And in place of definitive \nresults, an information war has broken out, unleashing reckless speculation, \nconspiracy theories and deep anxiety. First came the reports \u2014 trickling in from\n caucus leaders, precinct captains and observers \u2014 that the app wasn\u2019t working \nproperly. On Monday evening a precinct captain told me by text that their caucus\n manager was \u201cunable to get the app from the Democratic Party to work\u201d and \u201chad \nto do the math to figure out delegates \u2018long hand.\u2019\u201d FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Amelia \nThomson-Deveaux spoke to a frustrated caucus leader who suggested the app itself\n wouldn\u2019t download. \u201cWe could not problem-solve getting the app onto one of our \ndevices,\u201d he told her. NBC News reported some caucus leaders had missed the \nwindow to download the app altogether. The Biden campaign issued a letter to \nIowa party leaders suggesting the app had failed. Reckless speculation followed \nabout possible security problems with the technology. Stories from late last \nmonth raising concerns about the caucus app\u2019s vulnerabilities recirculated on \nTwitter. Among the chief fears: The app was to be downloaded directly to the \nphones of caucus volunteers, making it difficult to ensure the safety of the \ndevices. After midnight, The Huffington Post reported that Shadow, a tech \ncompany funded by the progressive digital media firm Acronym, was responsible \nfor building the app. Shadow, according to its website, bills itself \u201cas \nbuilding a long-term, side-by-side \u2018Shadow\u2019 of tech infrastructure to the \nDemocratic Party and the progressive community at large.\u201d Acronym quickly put \nout a statement distancing itself from Shadow and noting, \u201cWe, like everyone \nelse, are eagerly awaiting more information from the Iowa Democratic Party.\u201d \nThere\u2019s a great deal we don\u2019t know yet about Shadow and the caucus app, though \ndetails have trickled in. Vice attempted to install the app itself and had \nsimilar issues to caucus leaders logging in. On Tuesday afternoon, Shadow issued\n its first official statement taking responsibility for the delayed results. Via\n Twitter, the company stressed that \u201cthe underlying data and collection process \nvia Shadow\u2019s mobile caucus app was sound and accurate, but our process to \ntransmit that caucus results data generated via the app to the IDP was not.\u201d Its\n apparent failure is a nightmare scenario for Democrats and the political left. \nQuite simply, the party desperately needs to win the internet in their race to \nbeat President Trump. That means building infrastructure to connect and assuage \nvoters, controlling the narrative and overcoming the substantial time advantage \nheld by the president. In its first critical test, the party systematically \nundermined each of those goals. Shadow\u2019s failure suggests a potentially deadly \ncombination of techno-utopianism and laziness. The two fuel each other: The \noverarching belief that software will fix everything leads to slapdash \nengineering, procurement and deployment. The result is an obsession with another\n Silicon Valley term of art, \u201cminimum viable product.\u201d The author Eric Ries \ndefined it as \u201cthat version of a new product which allows a team to collect the \nmaximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.\u201d \nShadow\u2019s app seems to fit that definition. Reports suggest that the app was \nengineered in just the past two months. According to cybersecurity consultants \nand academics interviewed by the Times, the app was not tested at statewide \nscale or vetted by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s cybersecurity agency. \nAnd even if the app was working just fine, reports suggest the roll out of the \ntool was bungled, to the point where those tasked with reporting via the app \nweren\u2019t trained to know how to use it. The process feels reckless given today\u2019s \ninternet, where individual devices are easy to compromise and where routine \ndisruptions like denial of service attacks can happen at a moment\u2019s notice. \nThere\u2019s also precedent for rigorous testing. A 2012 profile of President Obama\u2019s\n digital team in The Atlantic detailed an excruciating process by which the \norganization simulated \u201cevery possible disaster situation\u201d weeks before Election\n Day to ensure reliability. Since the caucus is conducted in public view and \nwith a full paper trail, it seems hard to imagine that the results would be \nlost. Still, a critical failure like this creates credibility problems for the \nparty and confidence issues for voters, who woke up Tuesday morning to \nuncertainty. The cryptic nature of the digital firms and tech contractors is \nalso bound to raise questions. Who exactly is responsible for building the apps \nintended to protect the integrity of the democratic process? Who is funding the \ncompanies behind the tech companies? Why didn\u2019t the Iowa Democratic Party \ndisclose the app maker? How are procurement decisions made? Where\u2019s the \ntransparency? That the name of the company at the center of the fiasco is the \nliteral definition of opacity doesn\u2019t help either. Perhaps most concerning is \nthat, on an internet engaged in a constant information war, the Democrats\u2019 \ntechnology failure created an information vacuum that was quickly seized upon by\n trolls and political operatives alike to cast doubt on the electoral process \nand sow division. \u201cQuality control = rigged?\u201d Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s \ncampaign manager, tweeted on Monday night. The message was retweeted and liked a\n combined 14,000 times. Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. questioned whether \nthe results had been \u201crigged\u201d or fixed, as did the Trump campaign\u2019s national \npress secretary, Kayleigh McEnany. In 2020, even in periods of relative calm and\n certainty, conspiracy theories abound. By failing to deliver as an anxious \nnation watched, the Iowa Democratic Party helped transform the caucus into a \npetri dish for conspiracies. Democrats floated suspicions of their own party; \nRepublicans amplified them and tried out theories of their own; unsubstantiated \nclaims of meddling or hacking rattled around picking up shares, likes and \nretweets. Facts were scarce. Fear, uncertainty and doubt took their place. \u201cBig \nWIN for us in Iowa tonight,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted shortly before midnight. \nDisruption, indeed.

            "full_text": " Who Won and Who Lost the Fiasco in Iowa? The biggest \nwinner, Mayor Pete, loses the most from the debacle, while a big loser, Biden, \nwelcomed the absurdity. By Ross Douthat Opinion Columnist The disaster in Iowa \non Monday night exemplified so much about the American situation at the moment \u2014\n the failure of our parties, the self-sabotage of our institutions, the \ndisastrous interaction between creaking political systems and the flimflam \n\u201cimprovements\u201d of the tech economy \u2014 that it\u2019s tempting not to attempt political\n analysis at all and just let the thing stand as a kind of outrageous art \ninstallation, a fiasco that speaks for itself so completely that all commentary \nis superfluous. But the Democratic primary campaign will continue, and so \npunditry of some sort is required. So let\u2019s try, in the shadow of absurdity, to \nfigure out what was won and lost Monday night (at least based on the returns we \nhave right now). Let\u2019s start with one of the de facto co-winners, Pete \nButtigieg. Strip away the tabulation problems, and he had a great night: not \nonly outperforming expectations slightly to battle with Bernie Sanders for the \ntop, but also watching Joe Biden sink dramatically, leaving the way clear for \nthe erstwhile mayor to claim to be the viable moderate alternative to Sanders \nand socialism. As the biggest winner from the reported results, Buttigieg is \ntherefore the biggest loser from the botched count. He\u2019s deprived of headlines \nand momentum that both his own vote totals and Biden\u2019s plunge should have earned\n him, and his decision to serenely claim victory in the midst of a massive \ntechnological \u201cupgrade\u201d-turned-meltdown, I\u2019m afraid, played as a bit of an \nobnoxious McKinsey move. Even if Biden melts down, Buttigieg\u2019s window to become \nthe moderate choice could be a narrow one, lasting only until Mike Bloomberg\u2019s \nmoney comes to bear \u2014 in which case every day we\u2019re litigating outcomes is a \nlost one for his campaign. By contrast, for Buttigieg\u2019s co-winner, Sanders, the \nbotched count actually balances his apparent failure to win decisively, making \nhim a winner in the voting and the fiasco both. Yes, it\u2019s not as good an outcome\n for Sanders as a thumping 10-point win or a big delegate edge, but the solidity\n and national spread of his support means that he has the clearest path to the \nnomination in a permanently divided field, and if one of the main effects of the\n Iowa disaster will be to delay any winnowing, that\u2019s almost certainly good news\n for him. And the fact that it\u2019s Buttigieg rather than Biden sharing the win is \nalso probably good news for Sanders, given that Mayor Pete has negligible \nsupport in many national polls and little traction with minority voters. A race \nwhere Biden collapses and Buttigieg and Bloomberg scramble to fill that space is\n almost certainly better for Sanders than a quick consolidation into a Sanders-\nBiden battle of the septuagenarians \u2014 and the first scenario just became a lot \nmore likely. But less likely than it would have been without the fiasco, which \nis why Biden, the big loser of the actual voting, is probably the biggest winner\n of the tabulation debacle: It obscures just how much he slipped beneath his \npolling, lets Iowa be swallowed up by other stories (the State of the Union, \nimpeachment, coronavirus and then \u2026 New Hampshire!), and makes it modestly more \nlikely that he can limp through to South Carolina with a chance to make a stand.\n That effect is only modest because voters aren\u2019t momentum-obsessed pundits, and\n if Biden\u2019s support is as fundamentally weak elsewhere as it proved in Iowa, \nthat will manifest itself going forward regardless of the caucus headlines. But \nat the very least we can say that Biden is the only candidate competing in Iowa \nfor whom the delayed announcement of the victor is unqualified good news. For \nElizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, the disaster\u2019s impact is somewhat less \nsignificant. Warren\u2019s apparent third-place performance keeps her in the running,\n but if she can\u2019t beat either Buttigieg or Sanders in the early states, then her\n campaign\u2019s only purpose will be to accumulate delegates for a hypothetical \nbrokered convention. In which case maybe the meltdown helps her a little, by \nmaking such a marathon more likely \u2014 but it might also just obscure her \nweaknesses relative to the top finishers, giving her a reason to burn donor cash\n a little longer than she reasonably should. That\u2019s definitely the case for \nKlobuchar, whose failure to even come close to catching Buttigieg or Warren in \nher own Midwestern-High Plains territory should probably finish her campaign: \nThe tabulation meltdown may be a useful excuse to keep her campaign going \nthrough New Hampshire and even all the way to South Carolina, but she doesn\u2019t \nactually have a good reason to stay in. [Listen to \u201cThe Argument\u201d podcast every \nThursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] \nFinally, for Iowa\u2019s non-competitor, the other mayor in the race, the whole night\n went beautifully: A wounded Biden and a Buttigieg deprived of the full benefits\n of victory is pretty much all that Bloomberg could have hoped for in his \napparent plan to be the last non-Sanders option standing when Super Tuesday \nrolls around in March. And if this also brings us closer to a scenario where \nBloomberg succeeds only in pushing the Democrats into a brokered convention that\n fatally divides the party, helps re-elect the incumbent and makes the free-\nspending billionaire one of history\u2019s goats? Well, that\u2019s a risk Bloomberg is \napparently willing to take \u2014 and one reason among many why the biggest winner \nlast night was the man who has been profiting from folly and chaos and stupidity\n among his rivals since 2015, the president of the United States.

            "full_text": " The Racism at the Heart of Trump\u2019s \u2018Travel Ban\u2019 \nAdding Nigeria to the expanded list of excluded countries just makes it more \nobvious. By Jamelle Bouie Opinion Columnist It\u2019s happening a little bit out of \npublic consciousness \u2014 swamped by impeachment, the coronavirus and the \nDemocratic presidential race \u2014 but on Friday President Trump announced further \nrestrictions on immigration and foreign entry to the United States. Citing \nsecurity concerns, the administration has slammed the door on immigrants from \nthe African nations of Sudan, Tanzania and Eritrea, as well as Myanmar in \nSoutheast Asia and Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia. These countries, which have large\n Muslim populations, join seven others on the president\u2019s ever-developing travel\n ban. There\u2019s one other country on the expanded list \u2014 Nigeria. Home to more \nthan 200 million of Africa\u2019s 1.2 billion people, Nigeria has the largest economy\n on the continent and has worked with the American military on joint operations.\n But given an \u201celevated risk and threat environment in the country,\u201d \nadministration officials say there\u2019s a chance Nigeria could become a vector for \nterrorists who want to enter the United States. Nigeria\u2019s government has long \nstruggled with the Islamist group Boko Haram, which is responsible for multiple \nkidnappings and dozens of attacks that amount to mass slaughter. But there\u2019s \nlittle to no evidence that this group is a threat to Americans, nor is there any\n history of Nigerian terrorism on American soil. From 1975 to 2015, according to\n an analysis from the libertarian Cato Institute, just one Nigerian national was\n implicated in a terrorist attack against the United States. And, it should be \nsaid, the administration has not banned all entry from Nigeria \u2014 only \napplications for permanent residence. Tourists can still visit America, an odd \nloophole if the White House is actually worried about terrorism. But I don\u2019t \nthink President Trump is actually worried about Nigerian terrorism. In 2017, The\n New York Times reported on a meeting between Trump and several members of his \ncabinet in which he raged against foreign visitors to the United States. Citing \na memo from Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s chief immigration hard-liner, Trump \ncomplained about the pending arrival of thousands of people from Muslim and \npredominantly African nations. They \u201call have AIDS,\u201d Trump reportedly said, \nabout immigrants from Haiti. As for Nigerians? Once they saw America, they would\n never \u201cgo back to their huts.\u201d All of this was separate from the president\u2019s \nremarks on what he famously called \u201cshithole countries\u201d \u2014 those came the next \nyear, when he found a fresh way to articulate his racist vision of immigration \npolicy, where white Europeans are welcome and nonwhites are not. Which is to say\n that it does not matter that Nigeria isn\u2019t much of a national security threat \nor that Nigerians are among the most successful immigrants to the United States,\n surpassing native-born Americans in income and educational attainment. What \nmatters is that they\u2019re black and African and, for Trump, at the bottom of a \nracial hierarchy. I\u2019ve written before about the 1924 Immigration Act, also known\n as the Johnson-Reed Act, which codified a decade\u2019s worth of nativist hysteria \ninto law. It followed the Immigration Act of 1917, which imposed literacy tests \non new immigrations and barred immigration from the Asia-Pacific region, and the\n Emergency Quota Act of 1921, which established the first per-country percentage\n limits on the number of immigrants to the United States. The 1924 act was the \nharshest. It was also the most far-reaching. Meant to reduce immigration from \nSouthern and Eastern Europe, it also defined the American nation in explicitly \nracial terms. The quota system established by Johnson-Reed, the historian Mae \nNgai writes, \u201csubtracted from the total United States population all blacks and \nmulattoes, eliding the difference between the \u2018descendants of slave immigrants\u2019 \nand the descendants of free Negroes and voluntary immigrants from Africa. It \nalso discounted all Chinese, Japanese and South Asians as persons \u2018ineligible to\n citizenship,\u2019 including descendants of such people with American citizenship by\n native birth.\u201d In doing so, Ngai continues, the 1924 Immigration Act \u201cexcised \nall nonwhite, non-European peoples\u201d from its \u201clegal representation of the \nAmerican nation,\u201d setting the stage for the \u201cracialization of immigrant groups \naround notions of whiteness, permanent foreignness and illegality.\u201d Trump is \nalmost certainly ignorant of the Johnson-Reed Act (Stephen Miller, on the other \nhand, is not). But he\u2019s channeling the impulse of that law \u2014 the attempt to cast\n the United States as a white nation, off-limits to those who don\u2019t fit his \npreferred racial type. And with the Supreme Court\u2019s blessing (granted to the \nrevised version of the original travel ban), he\u2019s doing just that: using his \nimmigration policy to resurrect and reconstitute the exclusions of the early \n20th century. Although immigration policy deals with the external boundaries of \nthe United States, the elevation of whiteness has internal consequences as well.\n Not because the president intends to distribute benefits and favors on the \nbasis of race \u2014 although there are elements of that in his administration\u2019s \nbehavior \u2014 but because it sends a larger signal about who matters in this \nsociety. Every time Trump and other members of his administration make the \ndecision to stratify and racialize, they are also making a statement about who \nreceives a voice and who deserves respect. ",
