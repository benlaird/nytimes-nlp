First, you assume that what the GOP is offering is a reasonable and acceptable alternative. If that makes sense to you, it means you are one of the millions of Americans who have decided it's okay to flush our democratic republic down the toilet, as long your 401k remains intact.  It also implies that this current economic boom will continue unabated for eternity, that Obama had nothing to do with it, and that it's all happening because Trump is a very stable genius. You make the assumption that we can continue stripping away even the most basic environmental protections and be perfectly okay, as the waters rise to flood our cities and towns.  You make horrific moral compromises, like saying it's okay for our government to put children in cages and greatly expand the private prison system in order to do so.  You make the assumption that America can survive while abandoning our most deeply held principles, intentionally promoting lies, and abandoning even the semblance of fairness in our society. You make the assumption that everyone out there has a nice, fat 401k.  You assume there are other promising candidates like Bernie, who can bring massive followings to the race when there aren't.  You assume Biden is a solid candidate when he's just weak.  You assume there's a solid, moderate candidate to replace Bernie with when there isn't.",

If prosperity raises moral largess how come the plutocracy squeals like pigs when there is mention of a \"wealth tax\"?

The Trump team united confronts with a pugilistic stance the opposing Democratic coalitions, who as a team don't seem ready for prime time. \n\nUnfortunately, the Trump team has worked the economy well, even if to do so it runs huge deficits and dangerously deregulates. The Democrats may aptly criticize, but nothing seems to succeed like success. America has arrived at prosperity. Trump bets that principle will be overlooked in exchange for the goods on the table today.\n\nBrooks suggest that to effectively counter the Trump team united, a counter aim must be advanced by the Democrats. To run against the unethical, corrupt, morally opportunistic, divisive and re-polarizing, arrogant behavior of Trump: it might be enough. But compared to the economy, such issues might appear as merely rearranging the frosting. The cake, it's baked by Trump.\n\nMichael Bloomberg, however, might more effectively take the Democratic case to the public. A good bet is that he can talk business to the American voter better than Trump. His bright demeanor alone will contest Trump the boor and philistine, the slick reality-tv guy.\n\nPlus his can-do charm might appeal to Americans taken with Trump, the heavy-handed champion of twentieth-century America. Bloomberg might usher in a genuine American renaissance, one even many Trump supporters would prefer.",

The division between so-called \"progressive\" and \"moderate\" Democrats, and the animosity between the groups--often seen in these comment forums--is ridiculous. All the current candidates share broad policy goals with some differences on how to attain them--but you wouldn't know that by some of the divisive commentary between Democrats. \nThe reality is that Trump is benefitting from the Obama economic recovery. However, is preaching a \"revolution\" the best message when the public at large is optimistic about the economy? \nIn another time, the public would be outraged at Trump's behavior. I thought the Mueller report was damning. I was sure the impeachment evidence was the smoking gun and last straw. Nothing sticks. His behavior is unconscionable, as attested in his rejection of loving your enemies (Jesus' teaching) at today's prayer breakfast. \nThe Democrats need to get their act together soon.",

What Mr. Brooks fails to realize about the current economic outlook is even in good times everyone is still worse off.\n\nThe Great Recession knocked 4 years off economic independence for young people. A similar thing happened at the opposite end of the spectrum. Older working adults getting prematurely retired. What would you say if I told you you had stop working at 60 rather than 65? 5 years lost income and reduced retirement benefits. The economic repercussions are never going away. Why do you think young people are having fewer kids than they say they want?\n\nTrump is spinning fantasy. If you're drinking the Kool-Aid, that's your problem. Not mine.

I have been reading and following your commentary on PBS for years, and I cannot fathom for the life of me why people as bright as you are still don't understand that what you continue to do will only re-elect Trump. You are deliberately re-enforcing the points he made to justify his desired reelection, just like you did by constantly harping on the point that Hillary was somehow evil because she used a private email server as secretary of state. I am convinced beyond any doubt that had it been Obama that gave the speech we all heard yesterday, you would NEVER have written a column like this one. I have been reading a lot lately about America, from its revolution to the many obstacles that have littered its path to where it is today and have come to the conclusion that the country you have today (at least that you used to be before Trump come on the scene) was far from inevitable---on the contrary---not withstanding the wisdom of the founding fathers. I have lived in Russia/USSR for 30 yrs now and can see what America will look like after a Trump second term. Not at all a pretty picture. You are deeply deluded if you think that's an exaggeration. My hope (a fading one) is that a miracle is still possible, althought I am not optimistic. What a waste it would be!!!",

Brooks buys into the old theory that there are a significant number of swing voters, which is being challenged everyday by academics and others. And he wants us to believe that followers of a socialist would vote for a neo-Nazi like Trump. Sorry but I think he\u2019s wrong on both counts. It is  more likely voters stayed home in 2020 after Bernie and Hillary ended their contest in hostility towards each other. And there is clear proof in the data that is exactly what happened when you compare turnout in Dem districts that went to Trump in 2016 and Obama in 2012. So it\u2019s more likely Hillary lost because of low turnout rather than high numbers of turncoats.\n\nBrooks also ignores all of Trump\u2019s negatives and focuses strictly on rising favorably ratings that may not last. Moreover he ignores the legions of GOP voters who held their nose and voted for Trump in 2016. But I sense they won\u2019t do it again. Today\u2019s NYT article about the former Navy Secretary who is a lifelong conservative Republican and will vote Dem is an example that Trump has turned off many in the GOP. Then there is Romney who represents another never Trumpster faction: moderates. Brooks ignores such trends and instead posits an argument based on positive Trump data only.

I read this column with a lot of skepticism.  Yes, there are Bernie fanatics who care only about him being elected.  If they are in the huge numbers Brooks asserts, then the future of this country is more hopeless than I realized.

The Democratic Party's answer to that is, well, they are racist or sexists or probably both, so they are to be placed in the \"deplorable\" group, anyhow.   A group that they created and started pushing more and more people (IE. voters!) into.  This forced these exiled people to vote Republican  (the same people that, coincidentally, voted for Obama earlier).  \n\nEssentially, Democrats will take any mundane policy issue and make into a moral imperative as an method to try and win an argument.  Agree with us, or be grouped into the bucket along with all the rest of the \"Deplorables\".  It was an effective weapon for many years, but that weapon is no longer effective.  People see how it is being misused and are now immune to it.  As an example, reasonable people against late term abortion aren't misogynists trying to control women's place in society.  Perhaps, perhaps, that issue is difficult for some people to morally reconcile.  But Democrats, said there is no place in the party for them (as did Pete Buttigieg recently) .  \n\nMy sorrowful prediction is that Trump may win over larger than normal percentages from other groups of voters and Democrats will not know what hit them in 2020.  They will be dumb founded like they were in 2016.  Maybe he could get 20% African Americans, 45% Latino, 45% Asian Americans.  A landslide might occur.  I sure hope not.",

Are they going to vote for a man who cheated on his taxes, cheated his business investors, cheated on his wives and lied about it all for the last 4 years? Are they going to vote for a traitor? Are they going to vote for a man who took aid from the enemy in 2016 and tried to blackmail an ally to do it again in 2020? Are they going to vote for a man who is merely a money launderer? I think Mr. Brooks asks the wrong question. He should be asking Republicans why they vote for this kind of man? Why they vote for someone with his values? Why only Mitt Romney had the guts and the conscious to vote against Trump? I believe its because they are all corrupt and they have no issue taking advantage of uneducated Americans. They fund propaganda via FOX, Salem Media, etc and are getting aid from foreign sources. They have no backbone nor values other than putting their private interests above the public interest. They have no shame. They have installed coal lobbyists to run the EPA. They have left many government positions open creating dysfunctional government. Consumer financial protection has been abandoned. They cut corporate taxes creating massive deficits for our grandchildren so a wealthy few can receive dynastic wealth they will offshore. When America collapses they will just blame somebody else, anybody else for the collapse. That day is coming as financial deregulation is creating another bubble.",

I'm kind of skeptical of this view that \"all is well\" suddenly.\n\nAnd this \"either you're for capitalism or against it\" theme of Trump's is utter nonsense. You don't try to expand health care because you think capitalism doesn't work--you try to expand it because people NEED IT, and aren't getting it. \n\nTrying to figure out a way to get them insurance (Obamacare) was never a war against capitalism! Only in our country could lack of health care become an ideological football! \n\nAt the same time though, think about this: the last three Democratic presidents were each elected when people had a very strong sense that the economy had gone off the rails. \n\nAnd a lot of people in this country don't really think big picture that much, but only something like: \"will I be able to make enough money to take care of my family?\" And its hard to blame them, \nbut that kind of person probably won't give the other party a try if they feel secure themselves.\n\nToo bad they don't understand that we're basically one supreme court vacancy away from minority rule, and path toward the end of democracy. No amount of personal financial success will be able to fix that once it happens!\n\nIs a downturn the only thing that can save us now?",

The truth will come out eventually and this man might even have to go to prison for his past cheating and crimes against so many people. If tax cuts and conservative judges mean that much to people that they will ignore all his cheating and crime (fake university, fake charity, mob-like friends with the likes of Jeffrey Epstein, lying about his grades in school, assault on many women, paying  no taxes, ,many bankrupts, cheating on all his three wives, etc. etc.) then America will just get what she deserves.",

Even if Bernie wins, the big deal is going to be the platform, what the Democrats announce formally, and I suspect it will be a lot more moderate than Bernie did, because face it, the Democrats are a lot more diverse than the GOP. The GOP these days is a party relying on the anger of the white, working class, especially in rural and midwest farm belt, feeling like 'their country is no longer theirs' all the while really catering to the uber rich who hold the purse strings, the Koch brothers and the like (who are predominantly responsible for why the white working class is angry).

This will have tremendous ramifications for Ukraine to be vital to European energy security if Russia ever attempts to blackmail Europe by suspending natural gas supplies even briefly some future winter.\n\nIn addition, the Trump sanctions on the Russian second Baltic Sea gas pipeline to Europe has delayed its construction sufficiently so that Putin had to negotiate a 5 year extension its gas contract with Ukraine rather than just the one year contract he wanted.  There is no doubt that Putin wants to drop Ukraine from receiving gas from Russia totally.  The Trump deal has changed Russia\u2019s natural gas business on its head for years to come.

As Brooks notes, it is exceptionally difficult to unseat *any* incumbent president. When it has happened in recent decades (Bush 41 and Carter), it required both a recession and some type of unforced error on the incumbent's part. (In Bush's case, ongoing denial that we were in a recession until it was too late; for Carter, his perceived ineptitude - fair or not - at handling the hostage crisis).\nWe aren't in a recession, and it's unlikely - not impossible - that we'll be in one nine months from now. And Trump also seems keenly aware that avoidance of a major foreign policy crisis is essential to his re-election.\nI'm not a Bernie guy by any means, but I do think that he brings a moral clarity which the moderate wing - which I'm normally inclined to support - often lacks. Yes, the economy is doing great if you have a 401k, but...why is the min. wage still only $7.25, why is college increasingly unaffordable, why is daycare increasingly unaffordable, why do we still have no guaranteed parental leave, why is health care increasingly unaffordable, why do Amazon, Netflix, et al, pay no income tax?

For example, between environmental regulations and opening up immigration, if you had to choose one, what would it be?  My feeling is that most Republicans would choose limiting immigration, at the cost of accepting more environmental regulations.  Many of you would loathe to limit immigration, and that's understandable; but given the choice, my feeling is that you would choose better environmental regulations, and put immigration aside for now.  This leads to a natural compromise to both sides.   Limit immigration and increase environmental regulations.  Both sides will not be 100% happy, but much happier than before.  Am I right?

A qualification might be that David is looking at a nation-wide strategy, but with the political calculus narrowing down to four states, state-specific strategies should be considered.  The argument in favor of looking to a moral revival may, however, runs into the same difficulty that David sees in the argument in favor of pressing for economic reform: not everyone will think a moral revival is necessary, and the kind of 'moral revival' that might appeal in a red state might not work for a blue state.  I continue to think that when Justin Trudeau ran against Stephen Harper in Canada, his strategy worked surprisingly well: against Harper's rhetoric of us-against-them, Trudeau looked forward to \"sunny days\".  I think there are a lot of swing voters who just don't like Trump's enemy-focused politics.  What Democratic candidate can persuade us that he or she can bring Americans together?",

It's self-defense.\n\n- Unlike Trump who inherited his wealth, Bloomberg started a company from scratch.  This proves that he can competently run an organization.  Unlike the pampered baby prince Bloomberg grew up middle-class and has some clue what life is like for people who work.\n\n- Bloomberg is committed to fair capitalism: universal health coverage, raising taxes on the wealthy and making sure that everyone benefits from a strong economy.  Trump can't characterize him as a socialist or a radical.  \n\nDemocrats need to balance idealism and principle with pragmatism.

On top of this the Dems and the Times chose one neoconservative after another to make their case (Fiona Hill, Vindman, Pamela Karlan). Schiff dreamed Bolton, the arch warmonger and Doctor Strangelove would clinch the matter. Some Dems went to the far right to get unhinged Trump proving they too were not very stable. \nIn 2016 the media followed Les Moonves rule : Trump was bad for America but good for the media. The media are still thriving on this formula, all Trump, all the time which is good for their finances but bad for democracy, the Dems and the prospect of victory in November. \nThe Times rightly makes fun of Trump when he calls himself a \"stable genius\" but the geniuses among the Dems and the media have boosted Trump, 10 points thanks to the really not smart impeachment procedure. Now the Dems make a hash of their apps and primaries, support some unpalatable foreign policy preferences and the DNC seems more focused on stopping Sanders than on getting the conman kicked out. \nSometimes I wonder if not all Dems agree with D.

The more ideological, zealous or ruthless a candidate's following, the more incentive they have to lie to pollsters in this way. The only reasonable response by media is to downplay or ignore such polls and hope people stop conducting them.\n\nGiving someone a chance to benefit from lying anonymously is generally a bad idea.\n\nThe Clintons are, to many people, fairly shady and laughably poll-obsessed. Bill got impeached and tried to discuss the meaning of the word \"is\" in front of the country. That someone would sit out Clinton-Trump is not proof they would sit out after watching Trump's disaster.\n\nThe psychology of fearing a wide range of hypotheticals can exhaust people. Trump tries to play this game by overwhelming the news with a constant flow of bad and crazy stuff, but he is not the only one who uses such tactics. We need to make a conscious effort not to fall for them unless we want to see it used even more in the future.",

The Soviet, Maoist and allied governments set out to turn people against each other, to make spies of everyone in order to preserve the power of a tiny minority. What we in America did not realize was that the same pathology was at work here although in more subtle fashion. As inequality increased and community was destroyed by the proliferation of  mass sports and \u201centertainment,\u201d we became not only isolated but hateful and suspicious toward each other, we were trained in these emotions from childhood. Trump the master entertainer understands this almost instinctively; the actual Democrats seem to be operating under a view of human nature that does not apply here any more than in does in post-communist moral wastelands. Only Sanders, who subscribes to his own version of hate-thy-neighbor, is succeeding in stirring up the kind of anger that garners votes. Alas, the poor rationalists like Warren, Biden and Romney.

That is what a values based campaign against Trump calls for. Brooks needs to wake up his fellow Republicans to the fact that their dream of unbridled capitalism is an unmitigated nightmare.",

If, as I do, you believe that defeating Trump is the most important thing, why make the task more difficult by providing him with an easy target?  \n\nThe ideal Democratic candidate would be someone with broad appeal, a center-left candidate who can satisfy the progressives by signalling an intention to seek meaningful change but not so hard-charging as to drive away independent voters and moderate Republicans eager to be rid of Trump.  Bernie's rhetoric excites his base but makes moderate voters nervous.  Warren is better at signalling a willingness to compromise; but she, too, can appear overly strident.

Even mixed messages would  be better than the clarity seen from the left.  The exceptions - Klobuchar, Buttigieg, who are fringe candidates, and even Biden, who can\u2019t muster insider support, probably can\u2019t beat Trump.  It\u2019s depressing for those reasons alone, and made worse - politically - by the very real fact that indeed, the economy is doing well and wages are rising.  It can\u2019t end this comment on a happy note.",

The sentiment in these two states is not rising on behalf of Mr. Trump.  Thirdly I think Maine's two votes that went for Mr. Trump in 2016 will flip back to the Democratic candidate (and Senator Collins will also lose her seat.  In this scenario, the electoral college will be 270-268 in favor of the Democratic candidate.\n\nThat said, I think Mr. Trump, who does not believe that he ever loses (and so far, unfortunately, he doesn't appear to have lost much) will have a difficult time conceding the election, especially if it's close.  As usual he'll claim irregularities and file lawsuits and the GOP will back him.  THIS I believe is more likely than what Mr. Brooks presumes of those behind Mr. Sanders.",

If this is the best the middle class can expect 10+ years into a recovery, God help us in the downturn. \n\nMeanwhile out of control debt growth is robbing these same people from any hope of getting ahead or expecting competent and available government services (education, healthcare) moving forward due to the need to service this debt.",

Nothing. The only argument against Sanders is from the financial elite and their media servants trying to create the illusion that voters can't get what they want.

Every single Republican in the US Senate knows that Trump is guilty and that if it were a Democrat in his place they would have convicted that Democrat.  This election is almost exactly like the last election: Trump lying almost nonstop.  The only difference in 2020 is that Trump now has almost every Republican in Congress lying for him.  It isn't just Trump creating a faux reality it's the whole Republican Party.  This explains why the impeachment has helped Trump's numbers.  My own mother, who hates Trump, told me last week that the impeachment was a farce.  Propaganda works.  But, David, when it comes to what Democrats are saying now you have to take into account that this is the primary not the general election.  That said you're absolutely correct about Bernie supporters.  If their guy doesn't win the nomination they throw America under the bus.  Sickening.  And I know lifelong Democrats who would never vote for Bernie because he's all about giving stuff away for free.  That's his entire message.  Of course, they won't vote for Trump either.  Can Bernie win the general election?  He'll need to pick a Midwest VP, perhaps Pete Buttigieg or Amy klobuchar.  He'll have to change his message and win the debates.",

Done is done. But if we don't learn from the past, we are doomed to repeat it. The progressives thought they could counter the Tea Party, cooped by the Republicans, with Occupy Wall Street, at the time when President Obama was under full assault by McConnell & co, whose unabashed \"number one goal is to make Obama a one term president.\" Yet, instead of ring fencing Mr Obama, people took the Sen Warren's path to attack moderates or apolitical people like Jamie Dimon, who was a democrat. Incidentally, I have voted for Ms Warren twice as my senator; but it will be difficult for me to vote for her as the Democratic nominee for the presidency.\n\nMy point is simple. Extremism begets extremism. It can only drive moderates like myself away. In general, I do like a kinder and gentler nation, a real one, not the two Bushes's faux one. And Trump's amoral or even immoral presidency is not something one should aspire to. However, the extreme opposite is not the answer",

They become animated by the schoolyard histrionics of Donnie, the Punisher of Pelosi and the Slayer of Schiff.  Abortion and gay agenda were emoted as being felled by Donald Trump; and his \"haters\" became their \"haters\".  Upon acquittal, relief was expressed in churches.\n\nRank-and-file Democrats and Independents shared their disgust of how Trump was directed our government and Ukraine to march to Giuliani's smear campaign and of how the President defied all Congressional oversight.  The purpose (cheating) and the proof (the career patriots' testimony) were discussed.  And knowledge that McConnell and Company professed a political outcome was invariably the shared conclusion.\n\nYou see, David Brooks shapes his narrative that impeachment was much ado about nothing.. because, as a conservative first and foremost, he works to dispell backlash in the 2020 Senate contests.",

Yes, unemployment is down, but not every job is writing op-eds; many are menial and exploitative positions in Amazon, Walmart etc that REFUSE to offer full-time work or benefits (especially health insurance). Thirdly, economic \u201cconfidence\u201d is a pretty wispy metric, and it doesn\u2019t mean that people think there isn\u2019t tinkering (structural or otherwise) to be done. People are indeed happy with this relative economic stability, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s 2007 again. Capitalism, generally, may poll well but Americans have not forgotten their frustrations with its potential gross excesses. \n\nI\u2019d also like to note that there already is a Democrat running on a hopeful message of social mobility, caring and interdependence: Bernie Sanders.

Only Mayor Pete comes close in levity and optimism, whereas the other candidates are always looking over their shoulder and don\u2019t project the same confidence.

Hacker is very well regarded among political scientists on issues pertaining to political economy and democracy. \n\nAs Hacker noted, \"President Trump is running for re-election on the strength of the economy, and why not? The unemployment rate is lower than it\u2019s been in five decades. The stock market is booming. Overall economic growth has been steady.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: Voters are not particularly enthused about it. Recent polls suggest a substantial majority of Americans feel the economy is working only for \u201cthose in power.\u201d\n\nA big reason for this disconnect is that many Americans feel insecure... A booming economy hasn\u2019t quieted these concerns, because insecurity remains a huge and growing problem in ways that voters and candidates instinctively get but the sunny job numbers largely hide.\"",

He wants to expand economic opportunity in rural communities to temper their historic racism. More direct is his support of reparations for racism. These ideas are as materialist as those of his redistributionist critics, and offer an olive branch. But Sunday school teaches that evil precedes repentance or hellfire, not a bigger paycheck. So in addition to reparations, we need public confessions of guilt as in South Africa after apartheid. Criminalize voter suppression laws and give the authors amnesty for admitting their wrongs before victims. Brooks fears a vindictiveness flowing from perceived moral superiority, but victims can lose their taste for revenge when perpetrators speak truth. (See the ending of Polanski's Death & The Maiden.) Materialists have trouble understanding this. Weaving the social fabric requires a truth commission like South Africa's, and reformation or destruction of the political party that tore it.

Voting him out of office before the economy tanks would make the victory Pyrrhic for the Democrats. He would be left off the hook, free to continue claiming he is a stable genius - and of course the crash and the upcoming recession will become the responsibility of the next president. You and I know that what's happening now is a Ponzi scheme, more or less. They keep printing money and burning it - the deficit has exploded, in times of prosperity no less, so is the national debt, they keep borrowing more than we'll ever be able to repay - and frankly the whole thing is running on borrowed time. But try as you might to explain this to most voters  - you can't blame them for not taking your word for it, when their income has actually gone up and they seem to be doing ok. But it will crash sooner or later. And Trump has to own it. I know that was a questionable kind of optimism - but I'm not very optimistic by nature. \nOh, and another optimistic idea I have: if the GOP is now the party of Trump, and the Dems are on the way to become the party of Bernie - maybe decent centrists - Romneys and Buttigieges will come together and form a viable third party?

The same logic applies this year. If Dems nominate Sanders, he and he alone will beat Trump in the Rust Belt. That by itself should win the election for Sanders. But on top of his advantage with Rust Belt working-class whites, all women for choice and blacks \"have no choice,\" as Jill Biden would say, but to vote for Sanders, whether he's their preferred candidate or not, since the alternative is four more years of Trump, which would wipe out huge swaths of all the legal gains of women and blacks in the liberal courts of the past 60 years.

Bernie is by far the strongest candidate in that region, just as he was in 2016, especially since Trump's policies have led to manufacturing and farm recession there for average people, not growth.

Hate and fear can move voters to the right and Trump could win enough close swing states. In any case I would expect another close election with the Democratic candidate winning the popular vote.",

As the national debt and deficit reach historic levels, the stories of it are few and lack any real analysis of the implications. Democrats too fail to bring this to the forefront. Dems should frame the economy as having grown despite Trump. Both Dems and the media should be educating the public on the downsides of the massive deregulation being pushed. Coal ash in our water, more permissible pollution from power plants, etc. It is also important to remember we ar still in the primaries. The party candidate will run against Trump when there is only 1 left standing. Too soon for gloom and doom. I would also ask Mr Brooks, what responsibilities do Republicans have for supporting him?

Some of the repurchased shares are used as executive pay package further exacerbating pay differences. Some companies such as Delta air lines have given large bonuses,good for them.

Check. Use said deficit to justify gouging entitlements. Check. The Republican playbook is as old as topsoil, yet, they get away with over and over again because, honestly, I really don't know anymore. \n\nMaybe you should consider the economy when you drift into yet another high moral reverie. Is there such a thing as economic justice? One you seem certain of is you wouldn't want a socialist anywhere near the Oval Office, with all that undeserved health care.\n\nSo, just go ahead and do it. Jump.  You really don't have to dissemble about what a even-handed, sober, and responsible steward of the economy Trump has been. I had my fill of reality television  with the State of The Union Address. \n\nAt least you had the decency to make reference to an \"Obama recovery\". Obama inherited unemployment numbers in late 2009  at 10 percent. Trump showed up in January 2016 and the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent.",

We may not know yet who the Democratic candidate will be, but this country has had enough of this man who is as empty as a Nazi bunker.\n\nOn the other hand, I have just viewed Speaker Pelosi's press conference in order to make my own judgement instead of relying on a media navigator. \n\nI listened very carefully with no other noise in the room because she speaks softly and sometimes actually projects her thought out without the words themselves... yet, if you listen carefully, you understand her meaning. \n\n...And, I have to say, that each time I listen to her conferences, I am more and more impressed.  It is obvious that she is not a mouthpiece for a speech but is so involved with every idea and nuance in it that you begin to see how much it comes from her values and her heart. As Frank Lloyd Wright might say, \"It feels totally organic\".\n\nSo, in this conference after the State of the Union, Speaker Pelosi thoroughly explains her feelings and thoughts about the President's disrespect of the House and the falsehoods contained in his address.  She, therefore, felt it imperative to make a statement by shredding his State of Mind speech.",

It reflects the beltway blindness for the large segment of the population who are being told that the economy is doing great but do not see it working for them. They have been experiencing the negative effects of decades of wage stagnation ( any recent gains are paltry relative to their loss in the ability to afford descent housing, pay medical bills, get a decent education, etc.), the erosion of consumer protections, and the social safety net.  They are \"collateral damage\"  of the  deregulated supply/side, neoliberal brand of capitalism that gained steam under Reagan and has been abetted by establishment \"centrist\" democrats.  They didn't necessarily believe that Trump would fix this, but they were willing to try something different or at least lodge a protest vote--if they had any faith left to vote at all. You and many of the folks that you \"rub elbows\" with  probably have a nice nest egg and have no need to panic in the face of an unforeseen expense costing $1000.00  Most Americans are not in that position.  Like FDR (but nowhere near as \"radical\") Bernie Sanders is offering a real alternative to business as usual.  Rather than disrespecting these fellow Americans, we can win by electing someone that will actually represent their interests (and folks such as yourself will nevertheless, continue to do well).",

His failure to enthusiastically campaign for the Democratic candidate gave us the first four years of Trump; should he lose the 2020 nomination, there's good reason to fear his followers will give us the second four years of Trump.\n\nThe Democrats need a candidate who can show the electorate what's wrong with both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. And they have to do this while defending the American tradition of liberal democracy and free-market capitalism.",

Economic insecurity under capitalism leads people to fascism or socialism-both recognize people's economic hardship and provide a reason and solution (albeit very, very different ones).

Thing is, there were no Dems in the chamber at those after-hours sessions. Gingrich drew the anger of Speaker Tipp O'Neill as a result of this unethical sharp practice--and so the era of GOP abuse of electronic media was launched. Gingrich made Limbaugh an honorary member of the House, and this week, Trump added the other book-end by decorating that foul prince of dark demagogic arts. Democrats still have souls, and no Democrat can descend to those abysmal depths of sewage. In fact, Democrats will not throw away the election: it is not theirs to win.

His approval rating has probably increased in the last few weeks, but 44-52 is a better estimate.  David also overstates the economic case.  Inflation adjusted wages have grown more slowly under Trump than Obama, and growth has been about the same.  The tax cut provided less than a $1k benefit to the average family while giving huge sums to the wealthy classes through stock market inflation and much lower taxes.  Those key states he mentions are faring significantly worse in job growth than the national average.  I'm as worried as David about the electability of the Democratic field this year, but I think his panic is overblown.  I still think focusing on keeping Trump from having another term to wreck havoc is a unifying and powerful message to unite the disparate factions that a Democratic candidate has to mobilize to win.  I agree with David that a moral and social revival is a good theme, and arguing that the economy isn't doing well is not going to sell.  Trump doesn't deserve the credit for economic and job growth, but making the case is too subtle for the political media bullhorns.",

            "comment_body": "Having recently graduated, the similarities between the expectations for teachers and Democratic presidential candidates infuriates me. Many of my classmates and countrymen it seems are unable to prioritize well-researched curriculum (represented in candidates by detailed policy plans) over a fun, easy and mostly worthless semester with a teacher concerned severely with building their own cult of personality. For as long as I can remember, Democrats have put forth the former and recently, as a country, we have failed to recognize which candidates possess such preparedness and substance. Rather than recognize the issues with our cultural, educational and civic values, when these un-substantive candidates win, we justify the phenomena with the \"both sides are evil\" narrative, or, as Brooks has done here, blame the teacher for the laziness of students. In this pivotal election, with the constant distractions of Donald Trump's personality cult displayed on the news each day, we must focus. We must reject demagoguery. We must study each candidate's lesson plan as is our civic duty. We must engage civilly with those who disagree and, no matter how much we disagree, we must not attack those who support a candidate with a lesson plan over the one with no lesson plan at all.",

He made his CA political career scapegoating students and then re-purposed that trick at the national level to scapegoat \"welfare queens\" and social security. He was part red-baiter and part corporate shill. And as his published memoirs reveal, he was nearly as vacuous and dimwitted as the guy in the White House right now. And yet, the hagiographies from consistently fuzzy thinkers like Mr. Brooks persist. \n\nAs to Trump's 202O chances: enough with the idea that the left wing of the Dems will hand Trump another term courtesy of the Midwest Sanders primary voters who went for Trump in the general. Is it not obvious that this time around they may have the option of *actually voting for Sanders?* Given that option, many of them will not vote for Trump. This seems pretty easy to understand. \n\nIn 2016 Trump at least claimed to be concerned with the plight of working people (though he wasn't/isn't), whereas Clinton's rote genuflections to Wall St. were well-established. Of course many of those WI, PA, and MI voters went, grudgingly I think, for Trump over Clinton--but that doesn't automatically mean they'll do it again.",

Unemployment is extremely low, but the people that can't find jobs that pay more than minimum wage and must work 2 or 3 jobs can see right through that statistic.\n\nHowever, it is very believable that Sanders supporters are so emotionally attached to their leader that they would much rather have Trump than any other Democrat.  That fact cannot be refuted since it really happened in 2016 and led to Hillary's loss.\n\nI unfortunately cannot see Sanders winning a general election barring the possibility that an economic recession hits in the meantime.\n\nSo David Brooks is right -- I hate to have to say that, I don't respect the man's logic in general -- Democrats absolutely must come across with a winning message and a winning candidate. And we don't have either. Campaigning against Trump and his foul behavior won't work because many Americans no longer care.  America apparently no longer has any values.\n\nMoreover, if he espouses real American ideals, Bernie absolutely must communicate to his followers that if he loses, sitting at home, voting for a secondary party candidate, or voting for The Donald, is a vote for catastrophe.

Jefferson understood that people are disposed to go along with the status quo unless they are really concerned about it, and right now, that does not seem to be the case with enough of us. Americans are also notoriously short-sighted. The combination of all this is bound to keep Trump in office unless another candidate can be found whose personal qualities are such as to energize the electorate. I'm not sure any of the current crop rise to that level. Sanders is the wrong man, and not just because of his economic ideas. He's far too much of an ideologue to be the kind of politician who can get things done with such a divided congress. The others have good intentions, but they don't fire people up the way Trump does. We need someone who can get people thinking about the nature of the nation we were founded to be and how far from that Donald Trump is. That is what I don't see.",

The event  was full of lies, grandstanding, reality TV show ploys--not the least of which were bringing together ONE military family while leaving the rest in harm's way; choosing one African-American tokenized daughter of a single mother for a scholarship while the rest suffer from under-funded school systems; despoiling the meaning of the Medal of Freedom by bestowing it upon a racist, misogynist radio personality who has for years stirred up hatred among his listeners and who, like the admiring Trump, has lied on almost a daily basis to millions of people. Should we go on? It was a travesty of a speech, unreflective of any Union, and then followed up by two more public spectacles commandeered by Trump: the National Prayer Breakfast (and why should there even be such an event in a country supposed to honor the separation of church and state) and later in the afternoon by Trump's televised excoriation and damnation of all who defy him, paired with his unctuous praise of those who are his sycophants.

More good would have been done.\"\n\nWhich totally misses the roughly 275 bills the House has advanced, and that are currently moldering away in McConnell's Senate. It is a good idea to look a little deeper, especially when you such a large platform.",

There is no Trump boom. It's an illusion. All of the trend lines are just continuations of the trend lines that Trump inherited when he took office.\n\nThat's the difference between reality, and Republican reality. You have to hand it to Republicans when it comes to messaging. They can make their base believe anything, even that Donald Trump is an honest man. This fiction can not continue forever. And I suppose there's a chance it could continue long enough to get Trump reelected.\n\nBut I think David is forgetting how passionately people on the other side are desperate for a new leader\u2013\u2013desperate enough to vote for the cranky old socialist over the deranged sociopath.",

As a result of democrats\u2019 actions against his agenda, he has become a martyr to his base and has the potential of growing his support. \nTrump is a non-political, pragmatist without the burden of doubts and morays of the political class. He has impeccable intuition about his opposition, superb communication and manipulates media like no other person in the political sphere.

Unless you respond to people's values and needs as they define them  --  not as you believe they should define them  --  you will change precisely no one's mind.\n\nAspirational politics are all well and good when you're preaching to the choir. They are useless, actually counterproductive, in the current sociopolitical environment.\n\nAs well, the Democrats need to quit defining anyone who supports Trump as the Devil, whose very thoughts are contagious and terminal, if you interact with them. Change minds/votes or lose.\n\nBottom line: to defeat Trump Democrats must be laser-focused on the objective of defeating Trump, not on what \"category\" is due a turn at the Presidency. They must understand this is an election for President, not an election for God.\n\nAvoidance and denial are major problems in defeating Trump, as shown by the fact that none of the top three most highly recommended Readers Picks nor Times Picks of today's editorial asking \"What Will Finally Defeat Donald Trump?\" even addresses the question of how to defeat Trump. Believing that Democrats hold the moral high ground is well and good, but that does not win elections.",

As Mr. Leonhardt notes, the Bernie Bros' voting patterns were devastating to Hillary Clinton in the general election.\n\nBut Mr. Leonhardt overlooks a weakness that has been overlooked by many other political commenters so far - and that is ethnicity. \n\nNow, before everyone's hair catches fire about \"purity tests\", I contend that this is the main reason why Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. Clinton lost several million votes from the African American community (of which I am not a member, by the way) that Obama had won. The vast majority of these voters didn't vote for Trump. Instead, many just sat home, but the result was to hand Trump the win. \n\nThe fact is, any ethnic group that continues to suffer discrimination (and sadly in today's climate, skyrocketing hate crimes) is looking for a candidate who, they believe, understands their concerns and will do what is possible to address them. \n\nRepublicans already have their white nationalist party. The Dems do not have this \"advantage\", that is, they must appeal to all communities in this country.\n\nBut so far, it doesn't look like any of the white Democratic presidential candidates has made that sale yet to minority communities. But it is one they must make. And if they don't, they will surely lose in November.",

In the last two days, we've heard, repeatedly, references to infrastructure and reducing drug prices. McConnell has previously thwarted the bipartisan Grassley-Wyden bill capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors and requiring drug companies to pay back Medicare if they increase prices faster than inflation. It might sound far fetched but was Grassley's  vote to acquit traded for an assurance of the bill's passage, moving it finally to Trump ( who says he supports it) for signature?  Are there pet infrastructure projects in other Senators states now being considered for passage? Did those Senators trade their acquittal votes for those assurances?  No question McConnell had Trump over a barrel. But, McConnell was playing the long game. He most likely saw his opportunity to give Republicans Senators wins on key issues and lock down their bids for re election thereby keeping his majority in power. That's politics.

            "comment_body": "Won't work. The fact is half of the US thinks Trump is defending the constitution by doing what he does. They live in an entirely alternative political and cultural universe where their vision of America is the real one and it is one Trump and the Republican Senators support. For them \"the constitution\" is symbol, not line-by-line laws.  It means the America of their Mind. Thus the Democrats are the real subversives, defying the constitution out of irrational hatred and malice for American people. They are, without question, the corrupt and Trump is the incorruptible champion of truth and justice. The only thing that will turn them is the economy going south, and there's no time for that to happen before the election in a way that hits home. I believe Trump has won four more years, perhaps even winning the popular vote. Reactionary forces are ascendant everywhere. There's no reason US will buck this trend yet. Even if Senate and Presidency flips, Supreme Court is Trumpist for the rest of our lifetimes. He's the most successful politician of the 21st century. And why not? Whoever thought politics or running a superpower required morality?",

In both cases the facts proved that Trump crossed the line but nobody held him accountable. In both cases he responded by attacking those who proved his behavior was wrong as evil and as having lied to do harm to him because they feared his righteousness. \n\nAnyone who has followed current events has found that Trump is not truthful. He will not admit to having behaved as he has and portrays all outcomes as victories. Worse he\u2019s not an informed decision maker, he often makes silly decisions. Yet, Republicans in Congress will not criticize him for fear of his ability to manipulate Republican voters into perceiving critics as \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d attempting undo their votes. \n\nThe Senators may think that they are protecting their party and their re-election prospects, but they are enabling a person who has neither convictions nor boundaries. Despite his aggressive talk, Trump is fundamentally an insecure person who strikes out to scare away danger. He\u2019s going to escalate his bad acts until he is held accountable.

Larson's Social Security Bill, pass an infrastructure bill, fortify the Affordable Care Act, reform the student College Loan system, and go from there.

This is an emergency, and the only cure is to vote against the party that has consistently, and cynically, attempted to rig elections in its favor. Moreover the representatives in the Senate of that party have, with one exception, succumbed to fear and voted to acquit a man who was clearly and unequivocally guilty. He obviously committed the crime of which he was accused.\n\nIt was a conundrum. Though I did not support removing Trump from office\u2013I believe the election is the best venue to accomplish that\u2013it was clearly not morally defensible to acquit him. As was extensively documented, he did what he was accused of, and it was corrupt and wrong. What\u2019s worse, the trial accomplished Trump\u2019s goal: fatally tarnishing Biden\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Republican Party should go away\u2013not the millions of voters who have believed in its message, but the party itself. In a two-party system like ours, we need both center-right and center-left parties. Yet it is crucial that they be parties which at least attempt to play by the rules, not because they are afraid of being caught, but because it is the right thing to do. The current Republican Party does not meet that definition, and deserves to be soundly repudiated in the upcoming election.",

The other truth is that America is now ruled by a minority vote.  When they 52 Senators from 26 states with 18% of the population voted to acquit, that sealed the deal.  Democracy cannot stand with minority rule, especially when almost everyone of those states is dependent on financial aid from the 82% of the population who pays their bills.  Perhaps we have outlived this old Constitution of ours, for can it no longer guarantee majority rule.  Everyone I know, socialist or capitalist also acknowledges that he who pays the bills, makes the rules.  Time for a re-evaluation of our national finances.

Senator Sherrod Brown's commentary highlighted the cowardice of the Republicans, especially in light of Senator Romney's heartfelt speech. He noted the words a journalist shared with him, \"How can Republican Senators walk upright when they have no backbone?\" What is worse than acquittal of 45, is the Senate's giving up its Constitutional power of Executive Oversight.

The president has every right to set foreign policy according to the Constitution. Trump exercised that right, although he did not withhold any aid, as you assert. He most certainly should have as many of us are sick of paying what is effectively 50% of our income in taxes of one sort or another to aid foreign corrupt governments. Democrats think that the more often they tell a lie the more true it becomes but Americans are smarter than you like to think.

Her position, which spoke of her objectivity to seek the truth, had to be approved by McConnell. Collins is in a tough race in Maine and many women here are still furious with her for her Kavanaugh vote. Her apparent admirable position to stand for objectivity had to be approved by McConnell to improve her respect among Maine voters. The Senate had the votes so she could play politics with Maine's electorate. Now, with her acquittal vote reveals her true values which have yielded to the Trump cult and not Mainers. Mainers are smart. They will read through her political maneuvering. She will be viewed as cynical by lots of decent people. And Sara Gideon is a real challenger for her. Mainers will vote with values to elect someone whose interest is in Maine; and to take back the Senate from broken and immoral hacks. If Collins rated down with McConnell as one of the most disliked Senators in the Senate, her acquittal vote will only aggravate her worth with Maine voters. And there is a great deal of voter activism occurring here. Pay back should come to all these Congressional thuggish slaves to our gangster President.",

Trump is a street fighter and so the Democratic candidates must not shrink back from frontal attacks on his mendacity.

I believe that Mike Bloomberg is the ultimate pragmatist and at the least his ability to finance whatever is necessary to turn out Trump and his fawning senators can prevail.

A longtime admirer of fellow vets Colin Powell (say what you will) and John McCain, he consistently voted Republican election after election.  \n\nThanks to Trump, my dad's current NAR status means that, although he doesn't identify as a Democrat, he has totally abandoned the Republican party of which he once was a card-carrying member.  He finds Biden smart but weak, Warren divisive, Buttegieg promising but green, Bloomberg a long shot, Bernie a bit of a joke.  (His opinions, not mine.)  But he'll vote for any of them over Donald J Trump.\n\nHe's not alone.  He and my mom (Democrat), are completely surrounded by NARs in their neighborhood (deep in the heart of Texas, I might add).  They're Boomers.  They're grandparents.  They're well-educated.  They play bridge.   They don't Tweet, or use Instagram, and they found the half-time show \"a little too racy\".  \n\nBut they VOTE.  \n\nHere's to the NARs - our best hope for the future.",

But let us also not forget that Democratic Senators did the exact same thing when Bill Clinton was impeached in the House. \n\nThe point then, is that creating a moral juxtaposition between the \"virtuous\" and the \"corrupt\" is a foolish gambit because it denies that people are inexorably complex in their social and political beliefs.  It's also disingenuous one, because it allows Democrats to be part of a \"big tent\" where differences among factions aren't sliced along moral lines, yet people who support Republicans are afforded no such spectrum from which to avoid being labeled as morally bankrupt.  \n\nAs someone who has liberal and conservative friends, I find this constant morality playbook exhausting and self-defeating and I wish that Mr. Blow and others would spend less time trying to make people hate each other and more time trying to bridge the divide between us.",

Leave the cocoon and hit the streets.  Organize, march, beat the drums and be prepared to be arrested in support of our  Constitution as it sits in the hopper of a poorly constructed shredder.

Everyone felt intimidated, because disloyalty was met with personal attack and coercion was the rule.  He was a flagrant nationalist and went to war in Ethiopia to unite the people behind him.

I know, it's old-fashioned, but billboards can be an effective way to get your message across to a wider diversity of people. Put billboards up in the farm belt to remind voters how his tariffs have hurt them, put them up in cities to remind voters how he has done nothing for infrastructure, put them up in suburban areas to remind voters how he and the republicans have destroyed our health care system.  It can work with the right messaging and in the right areas.",

He has enough private wealth and outside funding that he apparently doesn't think he has to.  \n\nAny and all help unseating Daines -- and our Governor Steve Bullock believes it can be done -- will be much appreciated.",

Their goal is to nominate 3-4 very conservative Supreme Court justices. Controlling SCOTUS is the grand slam that ends the ball game. Control SCOTUS & you win the Cultural wars. Control SCOTUS & you destroy the liberal agenda once & for all. If the GOP can pull this off they control the political agenda for another generation whether they win elections or not.

He dedicated his life to come up with a formulation to resolve the problem:  let\u2019s aim for a society where everybody goes to bed without knowing who they will wake up as and be indifferent to the fact.\n\nGot it?\n\nI know you would.  If the Times published my comment and you read it that is.\n\nYou want to discuss? I am available.  I live in a brownstone a few blocks south of where you are. Dinner is on me and I know a thing or two about wine if you care for it.  The editor here will oblige to connect us if you give the nod.\n\nThank you in advance.",

Each service needs and trains needed skills for today's marketplace.\nI do not 'blame' those innovators who founded firms that have grown into large scale successes for theor financial success.  I don't know how to prevent or penalize their success and maintain our culture of hard work and innovation.",

My main reason for supporting Bernie is that he gets that the roots of most of America's problems lie in the wealthy having too much power and influence in our system.  Paradoxically, I'm starting to think the only way we will ever get progressive tax policy passed is with someone like Bloomberg who can get moderates on board.  I'll be voting for Mike in the primary instead of Bernie.  It hurts to say but I just don't think he can win in 2020 and even if he did I doubt he could build the kind of consensus that will get the government working again. There is just too much ignorance and misunderstanding around his socialism label and he might spell a historic defeat for the party and I just don't think we can risk that outcome.

He is not someone who will scare the business community off in the way Warren/Sanders seems to, in other words the state of the economy will remain stable and probably end up much better with a stronger foundation under Bloomberg.

But Katie McGinty, an environmental policy expert with degrees in chemistry and law, ran into an overwhelming obstacle: Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s fortune.\n\nThe former mayor of New York poured in $11.7 million to help re-elect the Republican incumbent, Senator Pat Toomey, who had led an effort, albeit unsuccessful, to expand background checks for gun purchasers, a top priority of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s.\n\nMr. Toomey won by less than two percentage points, handing a key victory to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell: The Republicans held on to control of the chamber by two seats. At the time, it was the most expensive Senate race the country had ever seen, and Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s money was one of the largest influxes of outside influence.\n\nA review of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s giving shows that he has not only backed Republicans in competitive and pivotal races like Mr. Toomey\u2019s, but that he has also sunk money into Republican primaries on behalf of McConnell allies. They include Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2014\u00a0Mr. Bloomberg helped Mr. Graham in 2014 by giving $250,000\u00a0to a PAC supporting him \u2014 and the late\u00a0Senator\u00a0Thad Cochran\u00a0of\u00a0Mississippi....",

The problem here is that this adaptation is pure veneer camouflage. The mere entry into the Democratic race for nomination at this point in time signals that Bloomberg has no respect for us mortals who don't have enough money to fill a wheelbarrow in C-notes. If elected, he will surely do a chameleon proud and change to his true colors which we have seen in his mayoralty, namely punish the poor.\n\nDon't forget that stop-and-frisk was not the only way Bloomberg tortured the non-white, non-rich. The dilapidation of public housing began under his long reign and reached horror when our present mayor took office. Bloomberg closed fire companies like the one on 125 ST. in Harlem at a time when population growth increased need for them. He turned his back on gentrification and the illegal harassment of poor and middle-income tenants.",

            "comment_body": "Bloomberg and I started our respective NY government jobs in the same year. I took a position as a NYS environmental attorney. The governing politics of NY and NYC was very different in those years. Both the State and the City had enormous economic challenges that were further challenged by 9/11. Rudy Giuliani was the outgoing Republican mayor, and George Pataki was the NYS Republican Governor. NY\u2019s senior US Senator was Al D\u2019Amato, a stalwart Republican. Either by being shrewd or pragmatic or both, Bloomberg chose to run as a Republican. Whatever his motivation, it worked and he won, and was re-elected for three terms. The 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center immediately changed all priorities for NYS and NYC. This meant that the City\u2019s Fresh Kills landfill had to be reopened, and numerous other environmental issues like stopping the offshore disposal of municipal solid waste had to be postponed. Although NYC is a bastion of progressivism, it\u2019s environment was in a terrible state of decline.\n\nBy the end of Bloomberg\u2019s mayoral tenure, the City had regained its economic footing, and his administration started to take on difficult environmental challenges. Bloomberg is a can-do kind of politician. At times, he may infuriate progressives with his pragmatic approach, but his accomplishments helped to usher in a very progressive Mayor Bill De Blasio. If Bloomberg prevails in the Democratic primaries, I\u2019ll have no problem giving him my vote in November.",

But just as important, America must always be a place where the middle class grows bigger and stronger. Right now that\u2019s not happening, because the rewards of the economy are far too concentrated at the top.\"\n\nHis view is admirable, he sounds like he would make a great president, but we still have that doggone human problem, that circular political/economic process where at best some people rise to incredible wealth but can only turn around, defeat the inequality created by their own rising, by creating a middle class which allows more but far from all people to rise, thus actually strengthening inequality, turning society from something of a pyramid shape with wealthy at apex to hourglass shape, the wealthy at top dropping the sand of their wealth (should they choose) through a narrow funnel to the lower classes below. In other words, how is a middle class to be sustained when it's only created to extract more people concentrated at top pressing down on those below?",

You are by far the proven most competent and best manager of an enormous entity in the field (twice, first with your business and then with NYC).  2. You have shown zero interest in self-dealing. A highly competent and  honest POTUS would be a big improvement. \n\nHere is how you get past that default motivation. 1. Powerfully own you ignorant insensitivity to \"Stop and Frisk\" and repudiate it in any and all forms. A leader who does such wrong to so many of their constituents without genuine remorse and repentance shows a lack of compassion that is a limitation for great leadership. And, if you really want to fix inequality (the cancer of capitalism) don't just change the tax code around inheritance, cap inheritance at a number that precludes the next generation to be in power without earning it. Without that capitalism essentially becomes monarchy and the uninformed, inexperienced, sheltered children of the reach become the power class of the next generation. The country always needs to promote its best and brightest to leadership, not simply rich heirs.",

I sincerely hope whoever the Democratic nominee for president would adopt proposals like these and push hard for them to materialize.\n\nThe additional revenue can be used for various progressive plans.\n\nI would also suggest to help the working poor to relieve the burden of payroll tax by cutting it to 1% on the first $10K and to 2% on the second $10K. To fill the gap, and some, double the annual rise in the cap of payroll tax. Furthermore, to strengthen the Social Sec Trust Fund, levy a smaller percentage of tax, say 1-2% on all incomes from all sources, rather than the donut hole approach. This would be less unacceptable to the rich.\n\nPublic school funding is too poor. Federal subsidy for public school education to reduce class size and increase teachers' pay is necessary. There must be a minimum funding to schools wherever the schools are located, regardless of local tax-revenue.\n\nPre-K education must be strengthened, focusing on reading proficiency. I would stress less on college education, other than technical education & job training.\n\nI would also suggest to have a top income tax rate of 50% on \"extremely\" high incomes, say over $30-50 million from all sources. These mega-earners would still be paying at lower levels on all their incomes below that - as recently as 1980, all incomes over $215,400 (about $700K in 2020 dollars) were taxed at 70% rate!",

They started importing doctors and nurses from Indonesia, Africa, the Philippines, etc. because we (America) did not provide what they needed.  Many of these countries from overseas were smart enough to educate their young people at taxpayer expense, who eventually ended up here in the US.  \n\nHealth care jobs, especially doctors, are good jobs.  How would you feel if all the good jobs were going to immigrants that had been educated at the expense of the countries from which they came?\n\nYoung Americans could have competed for these jobs, had they moved on to higher education as doctors and nurses.  But not only could they not afford to, there are not enough slots in higher education for Americans.  Competition is too intense for many young people to attend major universities here in Texas.\n\nArtificial scarcity in health care and education are driving up prices and stagnating our middle class.  In Fort Worth, it takes 3 months to get an appointment with a specialist!\n\nIf we want good, affordable health care and education in the US, we need more available schools and we need to educate more doctors.",

And everyone but virtue of their citizenship receives equitable and high quality education, health care and support from cradle to grave.\n\nSo far only the progressive wing of the Democratic Party has proposed measures that will genuinely rebalance our free market system so that we all benefit - and not just corporations, private equity and the ultra wealthy.",

Unless you respond to people's values and needs as they define them  --  not as you believe they should define them  --  you will change precisely no one's mind.\n\nAspirational politics are useless, actually counterproductive, in the current sociopolitical environment. Bloomberg is an entirely realistic, reasonable (or better) candidate.\n\nAlso, the Democrats need to quit defining anyone who supports Trump as the Devil, whose very thoughts are contagious and terminal, if you interact with them. Change minds/votes or lose.\n\nBottom line: to defeat Trump Democrats must be laser-focused on the objective of defeating Trump, not on what \"category\" is due a turn at the Presidency. They must understand this is an election for President, not an election for God.\n\nAvoidance and denial are major problems in defeating Trump, as shown by the fact that none of the top three most recommended Readers Picks nor Times Picks of the editorial asking \"What Will Finally Defeat Donald Trump?\" even addresses the question of how to defeat Trump. Believing that Democrats hold the moral high ground is well and good, but that does not win elections. Bloomberg could.",

Bloomberg needs to keep his ego under wraps. He shouldn't talk about his \"class\" or his wealth except to point out that he earned his money and Trump didn't. He doesn't get to compare himself to the Rooselvelts or even to call himself a traitor to his class. That's like trying to give yourself a nickname. Tell him never to refer to himself in the third person during interviews or at any other time. And find him a great writer who can give him easy to deliver, mildly funny, self-deprecating lines. He can't come across as humorless and self-serious or he has no chance.",

Toomey, the Republican incumbent, had led an unsuccessful effort to expand background checks for guns, and it may have been this effort that won over Bloomberg. In the end, Bloomberg showered Toomey with $11.7 million, one of the largest contributions in the most expensive Senate race ever at the time.

Everyone is paying a huge price for college education, medical care, and insurance, and these prices are built into every product and service.

That has been the catch in every plan in America since its inception.  \n\nTaxes are the price we pay to have a functioning government and country.  If Americans want to live in a decent country with decent social policies and good social safety net, all of us will have to pay our fair share.  Part of that means helping people we don't think ought to be helped and extending help up the economic ladder.  Social programs that are solely for the poor wind up being poor programs because there isn't enough support for them.  But programs that almost every person can use will be supported.\n\nAmerica is at a critical point.  We still have some choices.  After this election we may not.  Think about it.",

Include- as CA DMV mandates MD reporting to take away a driver's license when someone has a medical condition that could cause them to have an accident that could kill or maim another- similar rules for psychiatrists to mandate reporting behavioral conditions to gun licensing boards, so that folks with psychiatric conditions/histories that could lead to shootings/advancing dementia could have their gun licenses revoked in the same way, until a licensing board decides they're no longer considered a danger.  Otherwise- the taxes, the healthcare (I do like the private healthcare I presently have, but I would like to see government care expanded, and Medicare drug prices negotiated), teacher's (and many other's) salaries and higher education costs lowered- heck, I'd be willing to chip in some extra tax money at way less that $500,000/year.

But unlike them, you are one of the richest men in America. You're a beneficiary of the rigged economy that has made billionaires like you spectacularly wealthy, while it leaves the rest of us further and further behind.\n\nYes, you earned your spectacular wealth; and you've chosen to spend some of it on philanthropy and campaigning for Democrats. But you still have a serious credibility problem when you make anodyne utterances about inequality, the middle class, and taxing the wealthy. Many voters have the justified belief that greedy billionaires-- including the orange one in the White House-- bought us the plunder capitalism that created inequality. Another billionaire is simply not an appealing option.\n\nIf you want credibility from voters who are fed up with an economic system that is failing them and a political system that is ignoring them, you'll have to do something more credible than a \"lite\" (and late) version of Sanders and Warren. Just as you'll have to do something more credible than a grudging  pro-forma apology for a decade of \"stop and frisk\" and \"broken windows\" policing to earn the trust and support of black and brown voters. You can't buy the nomination with a few words and many millions of dollars. You need to earn the trust of voters who have good reason to be skeptical of you.",

No.  Does he have a right to learn from the negative impact of stop and frisk on minorities?  Yes.\n\nI am eager to learn more about Bloomberg's policies.  It will be crucial for his campaign to move beyond 30-60 second ads to provide more thoughtful details so that he can be judged on the quality of his ideas, and not merely disparaged for the extent of his fortune.  Put him to the test.  Bring out the fact checkers.\n\nI am convinced that   the proposals of Senators' Warren and Sanders will never make it through both houses of Congress and be sustained for more than one session at most.

Unlike the impeached fraud jerk we have now in WH. For sure there will be no tweeter posting at 3 AM attacking anyone. Nor he will try to be in our face 24/7/365.\nHe can beat Trump handily.\nBut make no mistake, Bloomy is no angel or a saint. He has the same authoritarian impulses as Trump.\nIf Sen Warren falters, I will close my eyes and vote for him.",

People should pay a very high inheritance tax--why should children get great wealth they did not earn?\n\n2. People should pay a carbon tax--why should people use a fuel that creates waste and not pay to dispose of that waste?\n\n3. People should pay for limited liability insurance--why should corporate owners get liability insurance FOR FREE?\n\nIf people paid for what they get, the disparity in income and opportunity would evaporate in a single generation. A heavier lift is probably stopping the funding of primary education via property taxes but rather fund it completely equally no matter where you live.\n\nI like that Bernie identified the problems of working people, but his solutions are completely batty and will not work. And his bros are just misogynist potential fascists. They keep threatening to not vote or vote for Trump if Bernie loses. That doesn't sit well with me.",

If wealth disparity and anger continue to increase, something will have to give in an uncivil way since the financial elite have usurped and control all the civil ways to ameliorate that anger.\n\nNo where on Bloomberg's horizon is the idea that people like him, the .01%, should have no more say in government than the average person. To the contrary, he thinks people like him should continue to be able to use their wealth to shape government as they see fit. It's nice that he seems more reasonable and humane than the Libertarian (neofeudalist) infested Republican party, but it is disgust at the corruption by and power of the financial elite that, ironically, got Trump elected. That simply because Trump mouthed the words \"Drain the swamp\", and \"Tax the Rich\", and \"Big Beautiful Healthcare for All\". The things Sanders has consistently campaigned for and actually means.\n\nThe actual game being played here is whether the financial elite continue to hold Americans over a barrel. So called \"Democratic Party Disarray\". Sanders is the first candidate in nine decades to turn the tables of power in the US.",

The biggest compliment I can give him is that he's a decent man and an antidote to Donald Trump.\n\nI'm personally on the progressive wing. But, it seems to me that Bloomberg has the personal history and the personality to get more things done for working-class and poor Americans than Bernie and Warren. \n\nUltimately, Michael Bloomberg's greatest strength is getting things done when political realities make it tough.

His twelve years as Mayor of NYC brought spectacular improvements to the City including laying the groundwork for attracting new technology firms that now provide high paying jobs and have eased the City's former dependence on the finance industry for such employment.\n\nToo bad; so sad that the Democratic ideologues will ultimately prevail in choosing a no-hoper candidate whose defeat will likely usher in an unprecedented era of far right wing political domination in the US.\n\nIt's happening, folks.  The Democrats are laying the groundwork for a total thrashing in November.",

His vision for those students who were not college bound was to have them folding sheets for the rest of their lives in the \"hospitality industry\", and be grateful for it. And finally, when the truth finally emerges, it will turn out that it was billionaire Bloomberg who orchestrated with billionaire Bezos to locate the Amazon HQ in LIC, to the immense benefit of his real estate cronies, long before Amazon ever announced its bogus search.",

Clinton still is made at Bernie and apparently 45% of Sanders supporters say they won't support anyone else.  This is short sighted and will allow Trump to be re-elected.  I also like the fact Mr. Bloomberg will be supporting Congressional races, because if the Democrats win the Presidency, but McConnell continues to control the Senate, nothing will happen.   McConnell is the most venal and destructive person to be Majority leader in my lifetime.  Go for it Mr. Bloomberg - I hope you are the nominee.  I think you can trounce Mr. Trump.",

As a person who was born in NYC, and lived with him being mayor he never seemed to care about anyone but the rich.  now he wants to be president and he cares about all the money the people on Wall Street make.\n\nWe have a con mand in office and if Bloomberg cared so much about this election why didn't he start talking to people two years ago like Warren/Bernie/Castro did?   He is to good to touch people and go to town hall meetings?  Of course he needs to spend the weknds in Bermuda as he did when he was mayor.\n\nMaybe Bloomberg has changed but it seems like the same old tired tune with new wrapping paper. Bloomberg didn't care that he destroyed communities with Stop & Frisk or the fact that he wouldn't allow minorities to be firefighter s.\n\n He bought his third term making promises to Quinn and wants to do away with Public education.  Why because charter schools have no accountability, just talk to his good friend Eva she has made a mint of money off of the backs of minority children.  Grades didn't improve but Eva, Bloombergs elite friend have made plenty of management money.\n\nBloomberg may have a spine but he was a dictator and people were always fighting against his I knw better than you mentality.\n\nHe would be difficult to support but some of us will hold our nose just to get rid of Trump .  Bloomberg's racist is just not as bad as Trump's but he is the flip side of Trump\n.aon man in",

Bloomberg doesn't entirely discount our system, but appears to desire to close the loopholes that have been created and to to shave a little more off the top of our most successful citizens.\n\nI don't want to vote for some billionaire who's buying the nomination... but why is he the only one who's common sense aligns with mine, a middle-aged middle class teacher?",

I think this can be done while still maintaining incentivization for hard work, innovation, and the creation of value (1000x the median income is plenty of motivation; 10000x+ is just absurd). \n\nI'm a medical student and have a progressive, but moderate idea for addressing the student debt crisis: How about allowing workers to write off their student loan repayments (the full payment in a given year - not just interest) as an expense, just as a business is allowed to write off an expense? If I make $250k in a given year as a doctor, but pay back $75k in loans that year, I really made $175k, and should be taxed accordingly. The cost of my schooling was a cost needed for me to carry out my business, analogous to a piece of company machinery needed to do a project.

Sanders will be buried by $500-million worth of Republican ads painting him as a hard-left socialist, and he'll lose at least 40 states (including some that should be reliably blue). For me, the Supreme Court is at stake. A year from now, I want a Democratic President to be poised to appoint the replacements for Justices Ginsburg and Breyer...and hopefully a replacement for Clarence Thomas, too. The stakes are just too high. We are facing a further slide toward authoritarianism if Trump wins. And there is only one number that matters: 270 electoral votes.

So tell me again how Democrats are disciplined fiscal conservatives while Republicans are irresponsible spendthrifts. Give me Trump's economy and economic policies over Obama's any day!!",

It's misleading to point out, as Rand Paul did recently, that federal revenues have been rising lately, including those generated by the corporate income tax. That's quite correct but deeply misleading since tax revenues are always rising absent some change in the tax code or a recession. That's simply because the US economy is normally growing; incomes and profits are all normally rising due both to economic growth and to inflation.   \n\nThe better question to ask is how did the tax cuts affect federal revenues as a percentage of nominal GDP?  Using nominal GDP corrects for both economic growth and inflation.  Some of the tax cut provisions took effect in Q4 of 2017 so consider that in Q3 of 2017 total federal revenue stood at 18% of nominal GDP. In Q4 of 2017 revenue fell to 17.8% and then to 17.1% in Q1 of 2018 and to 16.9% in Q2 of 2018.  The percentage then stabilized through Q2 of 2019 but fell again to 16.8% in Q3 of 2019.  So the tax cuts have lost 1.2 percentage points of federal revenuer due to the tax cuts bill. And most of that decline was from lost corporate income tax revenue.  In Q3 2017 corporate income tax receipts were 1.35% of GDP then fell to just 0.69% in Q1 2018 and were only 0.60% of GDP in Q3 2019. That's a loss of 0.75 percentage points or about two thirds of the total loss.",

They later paid higher taxes that paid back the govt for their tuition and helped fund policies in the public interest.\n\n Without those examples, today's voters are vulnerable to GOP messages on reduced govt, that are against the public interest, and pro the private interest.\n\nWhy don't the media and Krugman use these and other examples, which would be hard for the GOP to refute?

The theory states that in democratic elections, if Democrats appeal to voters by proposing programs to help people, then the Republicans cannot gain broader appeal by proposing less spending. The first \"Santa Claus\" of the theory title refers to the Democrats who promise programs to help the disadvantaged. The \"Two Santa Claus Theory\" recommends that the Republicans must assume the role of a second Santa Claus by not arguing to cut spending but offering the option of cutting taxes.\n\nAccording to Wanniski, the theory is simple. In 1976, he wrote that the Two-Santa Claus Theory suggests that \"the Republicans should concentrate on tax-rate reduction. As they succeed in expanding incentives to produce, they will move the economy back to full employment and thereby reduce social pressures for public spending. Just as an increase in Government spending inevitably means taxes must be raised, a cut in tax rates\u2014by expanding the private sector\u2014will diminish the relative size of the public sector.\"Wanniski suggested this position, as Thom Hartmann has clarified, so that the Democrats would \"have to be anti-Santas by raising taxes, or anti-Santas by cutting spending. Either one would lose them elections.\"\nWikipedia",

It has been about greed, but greed \"all dressed up\" by convincing people of the following: \"it's your money\"; \"you know better than government how to spend your money\"; \"government is the problem, not the solution\"; \"it's about taking control and being empowered\" (think privatizing Social Security). \n\nBut the G.O.P. has used Libertarian nonsense and Tea Party wing nuts to make sure that not everyone gets more money.  No, only those \"entitled,\" the already wealthy and fortunate get most of the money; the rest of you just have to get a job or jobs, work harder, so, someday, you too will be just like, for example, the Koch brothers.  (Remember the \"death tax\" nonsense because, someday, you too might be wealthy enough to have to pay federal estate taxes?).\n\nAt least the Libertarians are internally consistent, though foolish.  They really believe they can reduce government budgets by 2/3's and, somehow, we'll still be the United States, #1 in the world! \n\nBut note that the G.O.P., whether in or out of power has never really worked hard to reduce federal spending.  They love federal spending (e.g. defense, energy, agricultural subsidies) that puts money in their pockets.  Reagan submitted only one \"balanced\" budget.  W. Bush ran up \"off-the-books\" military and security spending for our endless wars.",

Next, at some point the US Government will not have enough to pay this and then the executive in office will have to have the Feds simply inflate the currency in order to make the necessary payments. At that point the poorly educated masses will start to scream but just as I have written many time in articles related to the messes in Venezuela they really should not complain as they are as much a part of the problem today that those in office are.

When he talks about bad guys, well none of us want bad guys in the country and we let fear override  the facts because who wants to be the 1 in a million.  when he talks about how great the economy is, well, we all want it to be true because locking our doors won't solve our financial problems. Same for his stupid climate change skepticism, we think, maybe we are overreacting or harbor inaction guilt\n\nWe know the facts but Trump creates just enough pinch of insecurity in the thinking public's mind that he takes some of the certainty out of conviction. Lincoln talked about a more perfect union and we liberals take that literally striving for perfection defining that to mean that what we do now is not good enough.

And, as for consumer confidence, that is high because of the \"wealth illusion\" created by stock market indices. More than any other President, Trump has used all the levers at his disposal to help financial market traders jack up the indices. I do not have hard data, but the so called scheme of \"using tax cut for stock buybacks\" had only a limited impact on the prices of stocks that make up the DJIA, S&P and Nasdaq. Because the financial services industry has created such complicated instruments, it is easy for them to fool retail consumers into doing (buying/selling) what the industry wants them to do. A handful of traders on the financial markets are able to create  the \"wealth illusion\", provided there is no oversight by the Feds (CFPB). \n\nAs for unemployment, the perception of prosperity helps businesses add jobs, but what we have seen since Trump took office is nothing extraordinary.

Democrats usually win power at this point and spend 8 years fixing the mess they inherit. Their track record is littered with difficult decisions and they get kicked out by a swing to the GOP.\n\nLets face it - we can expect another 5 years of Trump. the main focus must be flipping the senate and holding the house.

It has always been a Republican policy to run up the deficits when they are in power by cutting taxes for their donors and then use the deficit as a leverage to cut social spending when the pendulum swings. It worked. Bill Clinton balanced the budget by cutting social spending and deregulating finance enough to spark the stock market bubble.\n\nThere is nothing new here from a policy standpoint. What is new is that the rot in the US economy has gotten to the breaking point. The real reason for the \"booming\" economy, at least in part, is tha the Fed reversed quantitative tightening, reversed interest rates increases, and is now directly intervening, on a large scale, in repo markets.\n\nAll of this is the result of the economy being filled with debt to the breaking point, when an attempt to normalize interest rates fails at 2.5% and needs to be reversed on an emergency basis. The next step is permanent 0% or negative interest rates.\n\nThis should properly terrify everyone. US is still \"ok\" for two reasons: it is falling down from great heights ,so it is taking some time. It still has the reserve currency of the world. The latter advantage will go away simply because the US weaponized this advantage instead of quietly enjoying it.

It expands the economy slightly. But the result of that exchange is not the economy moving forward as a whole.  It drives up the stock market, which might make you and me a bit more money, but it has nowhere near the economic effect of putting that same money distributed in the pockets of the bottom 75% of the country.  We usually don\u2019t invest that money (outside of things like home remodeling).\n\nWhen the money is spent by the federal government doing things like infrastructure, the money circulates, and each move through that circulation, it increases economic activity.  The workers building that road, get paid.  They then, more often than not, spend that money on goods and services, which provides money for those other workers who get a slice of that money, to spend it.  They, in turn, continue the circulation.\n\nEvery one of those getting the money and spending it, don\u2019t spend all of it.  Some winds up in increased taxes paid, at each transaction.  Therefore, some of the money winds up going back to the government.  When it is given out to the wealthy, it mostly goes into savings (stocks are, in part, a risky form of saving), and only gets taxed when the investments are cashed in after growing.  And then only if the stock doesn\u2019t increase in value, there is no tax benefit.\n\nSimple Economics 101...",

Trumpy has ravaged the lives of the working and middle classes and the plan is to continue to rub them into the ground.",

The belt tightening that happened post 2008 created space for individuals and families to take on more debt, and that more than anything 45 did improved the availability of retail credit. And, as for consumer confidence, that is high because of the \"wealth illusion\" created by stock market indices. More than any other President, Trump has used all the levers at his disposal to help financial market traders jack up the indices. I do not have hard data, but the so called scheme of \"using tax cut for stock buybacks\" had only a limited impact on the prices of stocks that make up the DJIA, S&P and Nasdaq. Because the financial services industry has created such complicated instruments, it is easy for them to fool retail consumers into doing (buying/selling) what the industry wants them to do. A handful of traders on the financial markets are able to create  the \"wealth illusion\", provided there is no oversight by the Feds (CFPB). \n\nAs for unemployment, the perception of prosperity helps businesses add jobs, but what we have seen since Trump took office is nothing extraordinary. It is merely a tepid continuation of what was happening during Obama's second term.

Sure, a bit. It definitely helped the stock market as the rich needed to put that money somewhere after they bought their yachts and summer homes.

Like the last election, this one will turn on white Rust Belt workers. Michael Moore was dead right in predicting that Trump would win those workers in 2016, once Goldman Hillary was nominated and all the ones who had supported Sanders switched to Trump as the closest to Sanders of the two nominees (a con job the workers bought out of desperation). And Michael Moore is dead right again this year that Sanders is the only one who can win the Rust Belt back. There's no mystery to why Sanders crushed Trump in the Rust Belt exit polls in 2016, and would have crushed him in th election as a result of sweeping the Rust Belt. Sanders is the one truly on the workers' side, and they know it. Anyone who thinks Bloomberg or Pete can win those workers back from Trump is simply nuts. \"Moderate\" neoliberals want to emphasize the suburban vote, and claim that that vote will go for Trump if Sanders is the nominee. (Will suburban women really vote for The Handmaid's Tale in Trump's post-RBG court system? Really? Then they and their daughters will deserve what they get.) Like Moore, I think the real hinge off the election is in the Rust Belt instead. As our Dear Leader is found of saying, \"We'll just have to see.\"",

These same rich, as deficits climb will see beauty in laying off teachers, firemen, police, cuts in medicare and medicaid and social security.\n\nDemocrat's sense of beauty involves a strong reaction to climate change, alternative fuels, health care, education that does not bankrupt, social security and deficits to provide for stimulus.

It is interesting that the GOP played down Obama's economic chops by saying in a deep recession that there should be tight fiscal and monetary policy and claiming that the only reason for Obama's strong economy was easy money.  Right now, a decade into the economic expansion, the Fed should be raising rates fairly rapidly, which will also have the benefit of putting them in the position to cut rates when the next recession inevitably strikes.  And Congress should be raising taxes and cutting spending to allow room for fiscal loosening when recession and high unemployment cyclically return.",

The $1,000,000,000 deficits will never be paid off as they are added onto the existing $20,000,000,000 national debt and as interest rates inevitably rise, each incremental trillion dollars added to the debt will require anywhere from 20 to 50 billion a year in additional interest payments. FOREVER. It is conceivable that within a decade or so the INTEREST payments on the national debt will become a larger part of the federal budget than our military expenditures aka the defense budget.\nThink about that for a minute.\nFinally these interest payments go, in general, into the pockets of the rich----and then into the Cayman Islands.",

Suppose the gov gives Scrooge McDuck a Billion for advice on the comic book market, If Scrooge puts the bucks in his basement, & forgets about it, that doesn't help the economy at all. That Billion has a velocity of 0. Also, if Scrooge loses a financial bet to Daddy Warbucks, & the Billion moves from Scrooge's basement to Daddy's, that is a change, but the velocity does not change because it is not a useful change. It doesn't help commerce, but it also does not affect prices.\n\nThe gov gets money to us to use to buy & sell stuff by spending it or by cutting taxes (tax expenditures). If that money has low velocity like the Trump tax cuts, that doesn't raise prices, but it also doesn't help the economy very much. If it sends high velocity money to us, that would cause inflation except that, if the money is spent so that it increases production, that tends to lower prices & prevent too much inflation.\n\nThe genius of capitalism is that more high velocity money increases demand & more demand increases production automatically.\n\nHooray!!\n\n\n\n\nSpeculation is bad\nfor the economy. That money has a very low velocity. AND it increases risk which we have seen in 2008 ain't a good thing.\n\nSince 2007, the velocity of money has plunged. <a href=\"https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2016/04/a-plodding-dollar-the-recent-decrease-in-the-velocity-of-money\" target=\"_blank\">https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2016/04/a-plodding-dollar-the-recent-decrease-in-the-velocity-of-money</a>/",

Students are allowed to shirk away from learning how to integrate mathematical reasoning into their thoughts about our economy. The challenge for economic policy makers is two fold: solving economic problems with sound heuristics and then coming up with a short and catchy phrase that can be picked up by voters to rationalize the approach to managing the economy.

There were all the complaints from Republicans that then won them the White House when Bush jr. became President, and cut taxes. Then Obama became President and had to bail out the finance industry and raise taxes to repair the damage of tax cuts and wars. Then we have the Trump Wall st administration that passed Tax cuts and ballooned the deficit. Do you see the cycle Republicans have done? They are robbing the nation every time they win power, then criticizing the Democrats for raising taxes. They are robbing us and lying about it in a decades long strategy I observed. It's a reputation thing. The Republicans have been criticizing Democrats for repairing the economic damage done by their long term strategy of robbing the nation, and after they have the Trillions, they are exporting the wealth to other nations setting up their futures elsewhere. And I believe they are using the Stock markets to launder the money. I wrote about this yesterday morning and appealed for an investigation and then AG Barr directed federal investigators to seek approval of political investigations. To me that confirmed the program of robbing the nation decades in the making. Republicans are robbing us.",

What of a descendant of slaves and slave owners? Family lineage is so vast that we are all related to perpetrators and victims. If we owe debt for the sins of all our ancestors, we are all indebted. Moreover, no sum of money is ever enough to right a wrong like slavery. It would be more effective to identify downtrodden groups today and help them because of their need not because of a crime, however terrible, perpetrated against their great-grandfather. Historical wrongs are too complex and horrific to be settled by cash payment.",

Who determines eligibility? Are only white people supposed to pay for it? What if you're mixed race, do you pay out of one pocket, then receive in the other?

Clearly, the impact of slavery and Jim Crowe filters down through the generations (as described brilliantly by Isabel Wilkerson in \"The Warmth of Other Suns\".  \nHowever, people alive today are probably 7 generations removed from the slaves sold in 1838.  That means the people making claims had 127 other ancestors, in addition to the one they can trace back to those slaves (or perhaps two, if they are descended from two of the slaves).  One or two ancestors out of 128 (assuming 7 generations) perhaps gives too much importance to those individuals (in terms of the impact of that sale on those individuals) and makes it very difficult to calculate what an appropriate reparation might be.\n\nPerhaps the most appropriate approach would be to offer Georgetown scholarships to descendants of those individuals, or perhaps to descendants of any slaves from the plantations which purchased human beings from Georgetown -- though I imagine it is very difficult to figure out who those descendants might be.",

But on the average, they're putting away money for their children.  They're moving to neighborhoods with better schools.  They're hiring their kids into family businesses.  They're paying for college.  Every generation is better off than the last.  If your ancestors had been enslaved, that process wouldn't have ever gotten started.  The fruits of their labor would have gone to someone else.  Someone white.  The institution of slavery represents a gigantic transfer of wealth from black families to white families.  White families didn't just keep that wealth- they invested it, multiplied it (often in ways that black families, even if they had wealth, were legally prohibited from doing).  They passed it to you.  So yes, it still matters today.\n\nImagine somebody stole your grandma's $200 paycheck every week and used the money to buy stocks, and now they're a millionaire.  Your grandma never bought any stocks- how could she, without her paycheck?  How much would you feel your family was owed?",

My maternal side sent their kids to the US after the Revolution freed them sparing from possibly being killed in the Holocaust/WWII. Being relocated isn't necessarily a bad thing. \n\nThen there is the question of how much is fair. My family has done quite well because the former slaves demanded their kids achieve high educational standards, hard work, and to never whine about things that are out of their control. Most importantly they were told they could do anything they wanted to do. Most in our family are very successful. I know not everyone had such an upbringing.\n\nAny reparations need to be in the form of opportunities to improve one's lot in life. Paying for a college education for the 8000 should be more than enough. And if education is not the person's thing, the money could go towards a business or trust.",

Look at it from the viewpoint of pain and suffering.  If you are harmed, say by talcum powder, a jury awards like $50 million or something.  But if you were sold off as a slave, your descendants should get a fraction of that?  Doesn't seem right.  But my concern with the whole thing is that white folks in America will feel the debt is paid and the matter is now closed.  Racism, in a new context, can thrive because the slate has been wiped clean. Equality achieved.  No more grievance.  As long as the big B is not on the rental application, there must be another non race related reason you can't get an apartment at a particular property.

Hence, it will require equally structural efforts to rehabilitate and lift the descendants of enslaved peoples up, to provide the equal footing in American society that they never received. The prospect of reparations or affirmative action would be such efforts. \n\nHowever, considering that racism and racial disadvantage in this country have their ultimate basis in the application of the Law, I feel that the government, along with private institutions like Georgetown, shoulders a large portion of responsibility. One way forward might be channeling federal funds towards the proliferation of student scholarships, even a system of loans for entrepreneurs and business owners or targeted initiatives to improve funding for schools and other essential services in African American communities.     \n\nThough, as we have seen, many white people in the US refuse to acknowledge that personal or structural racism even exists (\"anymore\"), and see the insufficient and failing initiatives already in place as inherently redistributive (\"Socialism!\"). \n\nSadly, that is the myopia of privilege - to not perceive just how privileged one is.",

That ties the family remuneration directly to existing records. For others who can prove slave ancestry, but not a specific record of sale, use an average value from other records in that area. \n\n American law allowed those slaves to be sold and sometimes resold over four score and nine years.  The 3 million dollar current value estimate mentioned in the article would certainly not break Georgetown University financially, and it is clearly the case that the United States could likewise reach a valuation that could then be reimbursed over time in substantially more direct and appropriate compensation to the actual families.\n\nIt beats the heck out of tax cuts for the rich.",

Actual reparations can be worked out, such as federal matching of per pupil funds so schools in poor areas (that includes areas that are predominately white, too), will be able to offer the same quality education as affluent suburban areas. Alleviating student loan debt (or making all public colleges free), rent control, a $15 minimum wage that will increase to $21 by 2030, and the elimination of bias in mortgage lending would go a long way, too. On the top of my list is to eliminate \"law and order\" militarized policing in communities of color so that citizens of color can rely on police to protect and serve rather than profiling and using excessive force. Most white Americans are afraid that reparations will take away from their quality of life, but that isn't true.

I don't know him personally but I did know his father when he was head of American Motors and I sensed a genetic expression reminiscent of his father and the Senator did his father, the idea of our democratic experiment in government and humanity proud.  \n\nSenator Romney has potential and if he continues to express pragmatic views on issues that affect the well being of all humanity rather than the totally self-serving ideology of the G.O.P., like energy, global warming. clean air, clean water, our food supply, and the basics in quality of life and health that we are capable of, he can do a lot of good in the Senate. \n\nAfter watching the disparaging and vulgar remarks of the President at his celebration of his acquittal, today,  I would advise Senator Romney to return to Utah and inform the people of Utah that he wants to petition their support to change his affiliation to Independent and with their approval join the Senate Democratic Party Caucus. \n\nDon't just resign,",

I can't read his mind--no one can-- so I am taking his entire reasoning at face value without reservations. He finally stood up when it counted most in his entire career.\n\n Others who deserve the same award are Adam Schiff, Kakeem Jeffries, all other House Managers, and those diplomats and military and intelligence officials who dared to speak the truth in the House about the mendacious DJT and all his spineless and  self-serving cronies.\n\n Perhaps it would be equally fitting to institute and announce an award in cowardice and moral ignominy and bestow it on Mitch McConnell and his entire Republican ilk in the Senate and the House.",

Trump has no internal sense of identify so that he can distinguish between his intentions, his beliefs, and the results. His sense of self is all relative to how the world reacts to him. This may seem contradictory to his defiance of rules but you have to look back into his history to see it.\n\nTrump was raised by a father who considered all others adversaries, who used any means to gain an advantage, who  seems to have broken laws that he knew were not being enforced. That taught him that to succeed one focused upon personal advantage and to not take rules of conduct seriously. In addition, Trump came to believe that never apologizing and that always insisting that all efforts were successful and to strike back to any offense or criticism represented strength. He absorbed these ideas from others, he never actually tried to live as a stand up and responsible person. His defiance of rules is because he fears following rules will make him vulnerable and internally he feels too vulnerable to risk opening up.\n\nSo in my estimation Trump is an insecure person with vast power and authority at his command. This is a temptation for abusing authority that should be limited by laws because that authority can be applied contrary to the intended limits. That is the basis for the impeachment provisions of the Constitution, because power corrupts.",

In fact, it's not as impressive, because Romney stands to lose nothing by his vote, but the soldier faces physical danger and possible death.  Because the other Republicans are profiles in jelly doesn't mean that Romney is brave.  All of these tears and sobs--not even Hollywood is more self-centered and self-conscious than US Senators.",

It's your own fault. Show us something besides the mess listed above and doomed-to-fail health care plans. If you really are not for open borders tell us that loudly. Please. What about foreign policy? What about trade? Do you care about those things? I don't see it in the news coverage. Do something credible and talk in specifics, not in generalities.

The most hurtful thing about the impeachment for me was that Republicans wouldn't stand up for basic fairness for every American.  Once you are willing to allow a President to cheat in the national election, you have no moral limits, and you obviously don't care about democracy - only power. That makes me feel truly unprotected. My rights and my voice as a citizen meant nothing to them, because I am a Democrat. Worse, their supporters seem to largely agree, although I hope that is because they are getting distorted information. \n\nAlthough some everyday Trump supporters may feel that only they are \"true Americans,\" they'll soon learn that being \"American\" will only extend as far as they agree with the President. What is happening to Romney right now will be happening among citizens very soon - people will conform out of fear, and those who speak up will be made pariahs.

The same thing has gone on forever across the aisle, a matter Democrats conveniently forget.\n\nManipulative voting is pervasive among Democrats.  And Pelosi is a master at it.  She has passed hundreds of bills in the House that haven't a chance in the Senate.  She timed the impeachment vote for partisan advantage. She has even used legislation to undermine the Squad.  And she crafted the ACA so it would bar abortion funding and would help poor Democrats while doing nothing for about 27 million working class Americans, mostly Republicans, who fell in the 'coverage gap.'  \n\nAs for Obama, he enacted countless partisan provisions at the end of his Presidency, affecting millions of Americans as he saw fit, over the objection of Congress. Obama even awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Joe Biden in his last days, paving the way for Rush Limbaugh.",

If politics is a game of chess, the Dems never looked beyond the next move.",

And then there's the dog.\n\nNo, god may have a lot to do with the way Romney behaves and the choices he makes. But then if there were a god, there wouldn't be trump. \n\nSo, sorry Romney.

Usually she \"votes her conscience\" only when her vote doesn't matter, as in the call for impeachment witnesses. A vote to convict wouldn't have mattered in this case either, but she apparently listened to her Republican handlers and tried to give Trump a unanimous Republican acquittal. Romney spoiled that plan (thank you Mitt). She was well aware of how her ridiculous justification would play with voters at home and spent bundles on television advertising during the impeachment trial. She even took a page from the president's playbook, exploiting a small child in her ads. Really, does anyone think an 8-year-old with diabetes thanks Susan Collins for the ridiculously priced insulin that keeps her alive? Her vote to acquit (when her vote didn't matter) makes those of us who want to see her gone all the more determined. Many of us can't wait to vote her out of office.",

The Dems can rage & shout about Ukraine til there's ice on the equator. It won't change the mind of one person who voted for Trump. The more you complain the more he will rub it in your face. What progressives & their co-dependents will never be able to see is that Trump supporters revel in the non-stop drama, are galvanized when he punches back, are delighted when he spits in your face.

One could not imagine Americans being so weak and cowardly at such a critical time. \n\nNow that certainty is less clear. In near perfect lockstep, the Republican Party has shown us the bland face of fear, cowardice and opportunism. Good respectable souls meekly falling into line, some grumbling quietly about the futility of resistance but most expressing bright-eyed enthusiasm over the glorious days lying ahead. Yes, it can happen here. \n\nAnother musing is that the fanatical true believers have a certain initial structural advantage over ordinary folk. To create and promote a counterfactual narrative requires an emotional and intellectual commitment that energizes the believers. Ordinary folk take in the world on a more passive basis. No exceptional creative effort is required to simply report the raw facts of daily existence. \n\nOn first encounter with a mythic counter-narrative, one is apt to be be taken aback by the patent unreality of it. Can this really be what is meant? Surely there is a mistake. The initial disconnect engenders a cautious response. \n\nWe are struggling daily to get our bearings in this brave new fictitious world.

The author is right that the vast majority of the time Collins either votes with her party, or only bucks the party line when it doesn't matter. It's her timid, cautious way of being a Republican \"moderate\".  Her vote for acquittal was a purely political act (she faces a tough reelection battle); but she's got a pulse and well  knows that there is no way Trump has \"learned a lesson\". That vote is indefensible. However, in fairness I have to reluctantly admit that every once in while - rarely - she will surprise us by taking a more couragous stand. Her vote helped save the ACA from repeal in 2017. She is a reliably pro-choice voter; along with Lisa Murkowski, she  has consistently voted against Republican attempts to de-fund Planned Parenthood and to criminalize abortion. And she voted against confirming deVos, necessitating a tie-breaker by Mike Pence. \n\nHer occassional willingness to make the tough calls has provided intermittent reinforcement for some us...then there was Brett Cavanaugh. The last straw. I certainly plan to work to defeat her this year. However, I'll reluctantly give credit where it is due - in a hyper polarized time, she has shown an occassional willingness to cross the line when it mattered. Too few Republicans have shown that willingness.",

He learned that his party will not hold him accountable, no matter how serious the charges.\n\nSpeaking as a psychologist, my message to those who long for the President to learn from his mistakes is this- #1, past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. #2, every time you reinforce a behavior, you strengthen it. So, the impeachment trial (and all the other times the President has not been held to account) have strengthened his belief that he can do whatever he wants without suffering any consequences. This belief, among others, drives his behaviors.\n\nAlthough this belief began long before he entered the presidency (it began early in life which is why his behavior would be so difficult to extinguish) it has been strengthened so frequently while he has been president that the real question is...what will he do next? My guess is that he will do things that are increasingly egregious and his defenders will simply tell us to \u201cget over it.\u201d",

That is, no one is above the law.\n\n  And then Senator Collibns rationalized her vote to acquit by saying the President had learned a lesson, a position she had to recast as hoping the President had learned a lesson.  Yeah, right. \n\n   As some wag said last week, Senator Collins thinks long and hard about what she wants for lunch, then has whatever Mitch McConnell is having.  As columnist Gail Collins -- no relation, I trust, to my state's senator -- notes, Susan Collins is a \"moderate\" only when it doesn't matter. \n\n  I was enrolled Republican until I changed to unenrolled (independent) in 2016 because of Trump's takeover of what used to be a respectable political party.  I then enrolled as Democrat in 2018 and have stayed there since.\n\n  Senator Collins has waffled her way into irrelevance.

I salute what he did yesterday and although it is true that he is a very wealthy, 72 year old man that doesn\u2019t have to run for 5 years, I feel great personal sympathy for him.  Mitt and his family have lived their entire lives within the GOP ecosystem and in today\u2019s Republican Party he will not only be vilified publicly (as is already happening; even by his own niece) but probably privately as well. He and his family will find themselves personally cut off from long-standing friends who are subjected to the cult of fear that Trump generates.  That is not a pretty picture.  He knew full well that he was putting himself, his wife and his children in a bad social predicament.  You have to admire his fortitude. .",

That impeaching on such grounds would turn the presidency into a servant of the legislature.  This would conflict with the \"balance of power\" the framers envisioned.\n\nBut how serious was Trump's asking the Ukraine to investigate Biden?

The Democrats will crest much closer to the election, by which time today's news will be old, replaced by who knows what. I noted the look Justice Roberts gave Trump when greeting him at the State of the Union, and have some hope that he will jettison his partisanship for the good of the country when certain key cases come before the Supreme Court. Maybe that will change things. Maybe we'll get Trump's tax returns and reveal his flim flam. Maybe another Republican or two will grow a spine. Or maybe he'll win. In the meantime, the Democrats are debating the true future of the country -- do we want to go down in the flames of climate change by pretending that everything's okay, or do we want to at least try to stabilize the earth? This is the key question of the day and only the Democrats are debating it. It is refreshing and stimulating to hear their various policy proposals, see their various alliances developing. We'll have a candidate and then will be the time to panic, if panic is appropriate. But for the moment, this race is just beginning.",

I can't imagine having to endure 4 more years of a person and party that are only out for their self interests. Who knows what trump will do, perhaps abolish the 2 term president and extend that to 4 terms, or he may decide to put don jr in office as Vice President and then president.

Trump, who, despite being a pathological liar, is inadvertently totally transparent, never has anything but kind words for Sanders. Now Sanders is fracturing the Democrats again - of which he was not one until he tried to hijack the label in 2016! Why do people think that Sanders is admirable? And he really has no chances to win. He leaves the black voters cold, who matter a lot in many places, and alienates the Jewish voters, who matter a lot in a few places, but those few are critical to winning. He is like a cyanide pill for the Democratic Party. Warren (who is not a likely winner, either) is a far superior individual in every way. Why is Sanders even still around? Maybe because for Trump, he is irreplaceable. Sound paranoid? Think of the times in which we live. OK, maybe it's paranoid. But then the most charitable interpretation is that he is only interested in his own ego gratification. If he really cared about what he says, he would get out of the race and support Warren. But instead he divides not only the party, but part of the party. It's a catastrophe.",

            "comment_body": "When Trump became president there were 241 Republicans in the House of Representatives. As of now, 105 of those Republicans have either lost their seats or decided to retire from the fray. In 2016 when Trump was elected, the House was in Republican hands. In 2018, Democrats took over the House. In 2019, despite Trump holding mini-Nuremberg rallies on election eve in red Kentucky and red Louisiana, with two governorships at stake, Democrats won the governorships in both of those races. Also in 2019, the Virginia legislature flipped from red to blue.\n\nYou'd think with such a \"roaring economy\" this would not have happened. The reason it happened is probably because a majority of Americans are revolted by Trump and revolted by the kowtowing of Republicans to him.\n\nAs for 2020, please stop the hand wringing. Start doorbell ringing. And be practical -- no staying home on election day because your favorite Democrat did not get the presidential nomination. No voting for third party candidates -- that is like voting for Trump. Work to elect Democrats, donate money if you can afford it.\n\nVOTE BLUE -- NO MATTER WHO.",

I wish people would realize that any democratic nominee will push us in the right direction (compared to Trump), but I don't have a lot of hope for November. All I can do is pray that our country and planet will be able to survive another 4 years of this. The retaliation investigation into Hunter Biden is scary. I'm concerned about how many innocent Americans will be investigated under the Trump  administration for political leverage. Senate has already condoned it.",

            "comment_body": "Democrats are overlooking one of the central issues in this presidential contest, but it isn't one that is included in Mr. Bokat-Lindell's analysis. And that is race.\n\nTrump gained a large majority of votes from white men in 2016, and even a majority of votes from white women. The fact is, race is central to Trump voters' support of him. They love that he is a white nationalist. And if the economy is good, they'll view it as a vindication of his racist policies. If there is an economic downturn, he'll tell them that this is all the fault of their brown-skinned neighbors, and they'll gladly believe those lies.\n\nThree long years into this hellish presidency, Trump voters worship him like a deity. He is a known felon who, it has been proven, tried to sell out our country for his own personal gain. But none of this matters to his voters. As long as he tells them that as whites, they are the only \"real\" Americans, they will do literally anything for him.\n\nThe issue not addressed here is that Trump voters and Democratic voters want two different, and incompatible versions of this country. Trump voters want a regime of soft apartheid, where their rights, as whites, are paramount over others. Democratic voters want a country in which all are given equal opportunities.\n\nThere is no resolving this issue short of partitioning the country. Whites will continue to be the single largest voting bloc, and they will do anything to preserve what they believe is rightfully, and only, theirs.",

But given the many revelations yet to come--Trump and his minions cannot help themselves; it's their nature, it's what they are--enough people may yet get to that point.
