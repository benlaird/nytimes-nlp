            "full_text": " Which Candidate Would You Endorse? Thousands of \nreaders told us who they think should lead the Democratic Party \u2014 and the \ncountry. By Rachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are \nsenior editorial assistants and members of the Community team. On Sunday, The \nNew York Times\u2019s editorial board will announce which Democratic candidate it\u2019s \nendorsing in the 2020 presidential race. This year, the board experimented with \na new level of openness \u2014 publishing transcripts of the interviews with each of \nthe candidates that led to its decision. Viewers will be able to watch parts of \nthese interviews and the board\u2019s deliberations this Sunday on an episode of \u201cThe\n Weekly\u201d (on FX at 10 p.m. or Hulu at 11). In the run-up to the announcement, we\n asked who you, our readers, think should lead the Democrats in 2020. Your \nanswers were swift, and numerous. Out of more than 19,000 responses to our \n(unscientific) poll, four clear front-runners emerged, one far ahead of the \nrest. Andrew Yang clearly owes one or two of his thousands of mentions to the \nTwitter savvy #YangGang, whose 20- and 30-somethings flooded our submissions \nwith \u201cYang!\u201d and \u201cU.B.I.!\u201d (for Universal Basic Income). Pete Buttigieg, \nElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were the others most frequently mentioned, \nthe Midwestern (now former) mayor receiving just a few more love letters than \nthe two senators, who were pretty much on a par, and to some readers, \n\u201cinterchangeable.\u201d \u201cPragmatic\u201d was the third most popular word, after \u201cAmy\u201d and \n\u201cKlobuchar,\u201d in comments supporting the senior senator from Minnesota. She \nlanded just behind Joe Biden in commendations. Both were often credited with \nbeing able to harness the power of swing voters. And what of the underdogs, Tom \nSteyer and Deval Patrick? Well, their mentions may have paled in comparison with\n the rest, but Mr. Steyer\u2019s appeal as a \u201cnon-politician\u201d and Mr. Patrick\u2019s \nreputation for bipartisan leadership were evident among their supporters. Here \nwe present a selection of your reasons for supporting each candidate involved in\n the board\u2019s selection process (Tulsi Gabbard, Michael Bloomberg and Juli\u00e1n \nCastro, who has since dropped out of the running, declined the invitation to \nparticipate, and Cory Booker and Kamala Harris have also dropped out of the \nrace). They have been edited for length and clarity. Andrew Yang He \u2018sees the \nbig picture\u2019 I\u2019m a college student from Texas who voted for Trump last cycle. \nAndrew Yang understands the issues we face from technology and sees the big \npicture, how our problems are intertwined. He is the only one promising economic\n change that will actually work and that will impact my generation for the long \nterm \u2014 unlike Bernie and his minimum wage that will kill small business. Yang is\n the most promising chance we have ever had to end the extreme corruption that \nplagues our country. \u2014 Robert, 21, Denton, Tex. Policies that put everyone\u2019s \n\u2018skin in the game\u2019 Andrew Yang was the first presidential candidate I ever heard\n talking about reforming the intellectual infrastructure of capitalism, \nsomething that is sorely needed. Universal Basic Income, funded by a value added\n tax (as well as other much-needed taxes like a carbon tax) would be a game \nchanger for a vast majority of Americans. People living in precarious economic \nconditions would have more security and freedom. The working and middle classes \nwould receive more than they pay in. Wealthy spenders would pay in more than \nthey receive. But everyone gets it, and everyone has skin in the game. It\u2019s \nbrilliant. \u2014 Polina, 38, California \u2018The best chance of bringing us back \ntogether\u2019 While I\u2019m deeply concerned about health care, immigration and student \nloan debt, I think partisanship is poisoning our country. Andrew Yang is not a \npolitician. His personality is not divisive. I think he has the best chance of \nbringing us back together. \u2014 Angela Smith, 41, Morgantown, W.V. Pete Buttigieg \nUshering in \u2018a new generation of leaders' He is a relatively young man with a \nseemingly old soul, a brilliant mind coupled with a thoughtful and even-tempered\n demeanor. He can, and does, call us all to serve our great nation, to mend \nfences, to think outside of ourselves. The time has come for a new generation of\n leaders, those who have the vocabulary and the desire to speak about issues \nlike climate change, L.G.B.T.Q.+ rights and racial tensions. Younger leaders can\n wrap their heads around artificial intelligence, drone technology and the \nglobal marketplace in ways most of us cannot. I trust them. \u2014 Jody Danforth \nRoot, 51, Indianapolis He calls Americans \u2018to their highest values\u2019 As a \nMexican-American mother and foster parent of young children, I find campaign \nmessages centered on \u201cthe fight\u201d deeply unsettling. Yes, a president must be \nwilling to stand up for what is right even when it isn\u2019t easy, something Pete \nhas demonstrated through his service to our country and his work at home. At the\n end of the day, however, a win in November will still leave my kids sharing a \ncountry with a great many people who feel angry and abandoned. Pete has said \nthat the primary role of a president is to call Americans to their highest \nvalues. I know some people are never going to change, but he gives me hope. \u2014 \nKatelyn Woods, 33, Davis, Calif. It\u2019s past time for \u2018a gay role model' You will \nreceive many endorsements from Pete Buttigieg supporters, mentioning his \nbrilliant mind, his progressive plans, his calm and steady manner. All are true.\n But there are two aspects of his candidacy that I think are especially \nimportant to mention: his kindness (we are past due for a president we not only \nadmire but love) and his being gay. We had a black president, who became a \nbeacon and a role model for black leaders around the world. Its time for a gay \nrole model. Past time. We all deserve to be represented by someone with his \npersonal and professional gifts, but especially our gay citizens. \u2014 Mary Finke, \n76, Columbus, Ohio Elizabeth Warren The woman with a plan She has her ducks in a\n row and a plan for everything. While it\u2019s overwhelming to look at her plans, \nthey remind me that as a woman, Warren has to have one for everything in order \nto be taken seriously. I like her environmental plans in particular. \u2014 Erika \nPurdy-Patrick, 30, Dallas Able to overwhelm the \u2018old boys\u2019 network\u2019 She is \nlaser-focused on leveling what has become an impossible imbalance of capitalism.\n She does a surprising amount of listening and readjusting when her initial \nposition needs modification. She has always fought for the voiceless and managed\n to overwhelm the old boys\u2019 network in order to get her work done in government.\n She isn\u2019t \u201ctoo\u201d anything, rather a \u201cwonk\u201d practicing compassionate capitalism. \n\u2014 Shari Doherty, 59, Mid-Hudson Valley, New York Waiting for the \u2018next check' \nwas her worry too Maybe with her, the rich won\u2019t always take care of the rich. \nShe came from a place where you had to worry about the next check, and hopefully\n she hasn\u2019t forgotten that feeling. \u2014 Patrick, 62, Virginia \u2018She has the math\u2019 \nShe speaks with passion about the economic disparity that is affecting the \nworking and middle classes of America. She understands the struggle of being a \nstudent and growing up in a world that is increasingly being destroyed by \nclimate change, endless wars, and she knows how to reinvest properly into social\n programs that will help increase the quality of life in America and help \neveryone achieve that \u201cAmerican dream\u201d that\u2019s talked about so much. Plus, she \nhas the math to show for everything she does! \u2014 William, 19, Plano, Tex. Bernie \nSanders He can mitigate \u2018the end of the world\u2019 As a queer woman of color who for\n all 23 years of my life has had to watch the hours of environmental apocalypse \ncreep up on us from the not-so-distant shadows, Bernie Sanders is far and away \nthe only candidate who understands not just the existential crises we face, but \nalso the only one with aggressive enough policies to kick start human redemption\n and mitigate what is effectively the end of the world. \u2014 Niaje Morgan, 23, Los \nAngeles \u2018This is the fight we all want to see' As an American expat having lived\n in Norway for the past 12 years, I see clearly that the United States \ngovernment has little concern with lifting the quality of life of its citizens. \nIn Scandinavia they treat their people as their most precious resource worthy of\n investment and support. In the U.S. people are treated as disposable consumers.\n Bernie will crush Trump. This is the fight we all want to see, and you know it!\n \u2014 Matthew Gray, 52, Oslo \u2018The only candidate that can be taken seriously\u2019 He\u2019s \nabove the neoliberal politicking that has left behind the middle class, punched \ndown on minorities and the poor and devastated our environment. The mainstream \nnarrative is almost always against Sanders, but he consistently out-raises his \nopponents, has strong fervor in the base, and polls at or near the top. To write\n him off is a big mistake, much like writing off Trump in 2016. We need drastic \naction on the climate, we need drastic action on inequality. He is the only \ncandidate that can be taken seriously on either of these counts. \u2014 Stone, 31, \nChicago Joe Biden A stabilizer, at home and abroad Against Trump? Joe Biden. He \nknows and has interacted with most of the world\u2019s leaders and would hit the \nground running, reinvigorating our NATO relationships. He wouldn\u2019t be a chest-\nbeating, all-or-nothing president. If Warren or Sanders won the 2020 election, \nthey would lose the next, and our nation would become like a yo-yo, going from \none extreme to another. \u2014 Vicky Winteringham, 73, South Dakota The next best \nthing to Sherrod Brown I believe that the election will turn on driving voter \nturnout in black communities in the Rust Belt and Latinx communities in the Sun \nBelt and flipping white suburbs in both regions. Sherrod Brown could have done \nthis. Failing that, I think we\u2019re left with Joe Biden. He\u2019s a known quantity, \nand even my Trump-loving father thinks that he seems like a \u201cgood guy.\u201d Biden is\n running on a platform of normalcy. \u2014 Lauren Smith, 28, New York, N.Y. No one \ncould call him a socialist He is level headed and has foreign policy experience \nthat the others don\u2019t. We will need a steady hand to repair the damage to \ninternational relations done by Trump. But mostly, I think Biden can beat Trump \nbecause he won\u2019t be labeled a socialist like Sanders and Warren, which Trump \ncould use effectively against them. \u2014 Kathleen McBride, 70, Kansas City, Mo. The\n right choice for heads, not hearts If voting with my heart: Elizabeth Warren. \nIf voting with my head: Joe Biden. I can\u2019t ignore the importance of the \nElectoral College and swing voters in key battleground states. Ms. Warren is \nsmart and passionate. Her diagnosis of domestic problems is spot on. But I\u2019m \nnervous that the boldness of her solutions won\u2019t appeal to moderates. No one can\n touch Joe Biden\u2019s expertise in international affairs, he appeals to moderates \nand he seems to be an ethical man. Though his age is a bit of a concern for me. \n\u2014 Colleen, 61, Mountain View, Calif. Amy Klobuchar Tenacious, pragmatic, \nmoderate Amy has the leadership experience, pragmatic approach to governing and \ntenacity to make things happen. Though I would like to see more overt \nprogressive bonfires from her, it seems if we are going to attract moderate \nRepublicans and independents, we need a more moderate candidate. \u2014 Joanne, 58, \nWashington, D.C. Champion of the \u2018less sexy issues\u2019 Yes, Amy Klobuchar has \nstances for newsworthy policies like abortion, impeachment, clean energy and \nMedicare for All, but she is also one of the few to make less sexy issues part \nof her platform: big tech, broadband in rural America and infrastructure, which \none could argue have a greater affect on day-to-day life. And I think \nelectability is a bit of an empty term, but if you wanted to make a case for the\n most electable candidate, it is definitely her. The suburban white woman\u2019s vote\n is something Amy could easily secure. \u2014 Hannah Spears, 23, New York, N.Y. \nWinner of the heartland She knows she can win the heartland and she will stand \nup to Trump and defuse his vulgar coarseness with humor. She is the person to \nmove the country forward at this time, when things are much worse than The New \nYork Times and other so-called media are aware. You don\u2019t have any clue what \nreal folk are all about. We are not all from New York or Los Angeles. \u2014 William \nL., 74, San Antonio Tom Steyer \u2018Tom is \u201cChange that can happen.\u201d\u2019 He is not \nWashington political establishment, but he understands it. His astronomical \nsuccess in finance speaks for itself. I don\u2019t need to know what he stands for \nwith regard to this or that. I see a man of character, a smart man who knows how\n to build consensus in spite of our pop culture, media-saturated, vacuous \ninstant expectations. If Obama was \u201cChange you can believe in,\u201d Tom is \u201cChange \nthat can happen.\u201d \u2014 Maxim Langstaff, 62, North Carolina The \u2018non-politician' who\n should have run in 2016 Tom Steyer seems to be that non-politician, a smart \nbusinessman who is also ethical, moral and justice oriented. I wish he had run \nin 2016! \u2014 Katherine Davis, 64, Lawrenceville, Ga. \u2018Probably an early riser\u2019 Tom\n Steyer: Not tarnished, not tired; probably an early riser. He\u2019s an experienced \ndecision maker. He puts his money where he feels it will do the most. He is \nhonest and has integrity and is a hard worker. And he seeks counsel when needed.\n \u2014 Carolyn Proctor, 65, Washington, D.C. Deval Patrick \u2018The most rounded \ncandidate\u2019 I want to support Deval Patrick as he is the most rounded candidate \nbut it seems that I would be wasting my vote to do so. I hold out hope that he \nwill gain traction after such a late start. \u2014 Andrew S, 56, Brookline, Mass. \nHe\u2019s proven he can win the whole country Deval Patrick has experience as an \nexecutive and two terms as governor of Massachusetts, the diversity of which \napproximates the diversity of the entire country. He leads by listening and \nempowering talented individuals to succeed. This quality is more important for a\n president than promoting a legislative agenda, which is in the realm of \nCongress. \u2014 Michael, 51, Concord, N.H. ",

            "full_text": " Trump\u2019s Evil Is Contagious The president has shown us\n exactly what happens when good people do nothing. By Timothy Egan Contributing \nOpinion Writer It passed with the usual shrug by the usual handmaidens of hatred\n when the president of the world\u2019s most powerful democracy threatened to commit \nwar crimes by bombing Iranian cultural sites \u2014 the kind of barbarism practiced \nby the Taliban and rogue-state thugs. After being told that he would be in \nviolation of Geneva Convention rules that the United States had helped to create\n back when America was actually great, President Trump relented, but still \nwondered: Why not? The warlord in chief had already gone out of his way to \nprotect a Navy SEAL member who\u2019d been accused of committing war crimes. And what\n kind of man did the president upend the military code of justice for? \u201cThe guy \nis freaking evil,\u201d one fellow SEAL told investigators, referring to Special \nOperations Chief Edward Gallagher, who was convicted of posing for photos with \nthe corpse of a teenage boy who\u2019d been killed in his custody. After the \npresidential intervention, the formerly shamed serviceman was posing at Mar-a-\nLago. On any given day, Trump is vindictive, ignorant, narcissistic, a fraud \u2014 \nwell, his pathologies are well known. But it\u2019s time to apply the same word to \nhim as the brave Navy man did to the renegade in his unit. Under Trump, the \nUnited States is a confederacy of corruption, driven by a thousand points of \nevil. And that evil is contagious. We all grew up hearing an ageless warning \nabout public morality: that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is \nfor good people to do nothing. The presumed outcome is reassuring, a story we \ntell ourselves. But in the last three years, that homily has been proved right, \nin the country where it was not supposed to happen. The Trump presidency has \nshown just how many ostensibly good people will do nothing, and how evil, when \ngiven a free rein at the top, trickles down. When Trump retweeted a fabricated \nimage of the two most important Democratic leaders of Congress dressed in \nIslamic garb in front of the Iranian flag, there was no chorus of condemnation \nfrom his side. Here was a graphic lie, a cheap defamation, the kind of dirty \nlittle trick that politicians usually give to the felon operating under the \nradar. For Trump, it was just another Monday. Was it politics, or evil, when \ncandidate Trump smeared a Gold Star family in 2016? Was it a mere shift in \npublic policy, or evil, when Trump allowed people acting in our name to put \nchildren in cages and separate them from their mothers? Was it mere theatrics to\n revel in a chant of \u201cLock her up,\u201d about Hillary Clinton, who has now been \nexonerated, twice, by federal investigators? Was it normal for the 44th \nsuccessor of a president who could not tell a lie, to lie more than 15,000 \ntimes? Trump has so desensitized us that a day without a round of blunt force \ncruelty from the White House is newsworthy. And now it all comes to a boil in \nthe impeachment trial. The facts are not in dispute: Trump tried to force a \nstruggling democracy into doing his political dirty work for him. He tried to \nsqueeze a foreign power into meddling in our election. What is very much in \ndoubt is whether enough good people will do something. In the process of this \nhigh crime, Trump broke the law, as a nonpartisan congressional watchdog \nreported Thursday. The greater evil is the violation of the lofty purpose \nwritten into this country\u2019s founding documents. The smaller evils are the \nRepublican senators who know the president violated his oath and should be \nremoved, but don\u2019t have the guts to say so. \u201cDo not, as my party did, \nunderestimate the evil, desperate nature of evil, desperate people,\u201d writes Rick\n Wilson, the Republican operative and witty Never-Trumper, in \u201cRunning Against \nthe Devil,\u201d his new book. \u201cThere is no bottom. There is no shame. There are no \nlimits.\u201d As for the contagion of evil, you need not look far. In Texas this \nmonth, Gov. Greg Abbott said his state would become the first to refuse to take \nin even a small number of legal, fully vetted refugees. These are people who\u2019ve \nbeen approved by the federal government for asylum, after being displaced by \nwar, famine or persecution. In the past, people from Vietnam, Cuba and Africa \nhave been welcomed, and have gone on to become some of our finest citizens. A \nhandful of citizens, the Catholic Church, some members of Congress, objected. \n\u201cAccepting refugees with open arms \u2014 giving without keeping score \u2014 is who we \nare as Americans,\u201d tweeted Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of \nWashington, herself an immigrant. Sorry, that\u2019s not who we are as Americans in \nthe Trump era. When the hate flag is flying, most of Trump\u2019s followers have \nstood up and saluted. Here\u2019s the two-step that all good people must take now: \nFirst, realize the level of depravity that has taken over the White House, and \nsecond, fight accordingly. \u201cDo not come to this fight believing that the Trump \nteam views any action, including outright criminality, as off limits,\u201d writes \nWilson. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to cheat, lie or coerce. But it means you do \nhave to fight, or be counted among the do-nothings who allowed evil to flourish.\n Timothy Egan (@nytegan) is a contributing opinion writer who covers the \nenvironment, the American West and politics.

            "full_text": " When Trump\u2019s Thugs Turn on Him Lev Parnas has shown \nus Trumpism from the inside. By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist One good \nthing about surrounding yourself with tawdry gangsters and grifters is that if \nthey flip on you, you can claim they have no credibility because they\u2019re \ncriminals. Now that Lev Parnas, a key conspirator in Donald Trump and Rudy \nGiuliani\u2019s plot to shake down Ukraine, is singing, Trump\u2019s defenders are \npointing out that he is a disreputable person who can\u2019t be trusted. \u201cThis is a \nman who is under indictment and who\u2019s actually out on bail. This is a man who \nowns a company called Fraud Inc.,\u201d the White House press secretary, Stephanie \nGrisham, said on Fox News, the only network on which she regularly appears. \n(Parnas\u2019s company was actually called Fraud Guarantee, though that\u2019s not any \nbetter.) Grisham is obviously correct that he\u2019s a shady character. He\u2019s \ncertainly not someone you\u2019d want, say, threatening foreign officials on behalf \nof the president of the United States, as Parnas claimed he did during an \nextraordinary interview with Rachel Maddow that aired on Wednesday and Thursday \non MSNBC. Trumpists similarly dismissed Michael Cohen, who served as Trump\u2019s \npersonal lawyer before Giuliani did. The day Cohen testified to Congress that \nTrump is a \u201cracist,\u201d a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201ccheat,\u201d a Trump campaign spokeswoman \nblasted him as \u201ca felon, a disbarred lawyer and a convicted perjurer.\u201d (Some of \nhis felonies, of course, were things he did for Trump.) When Rick Gates, Trump\u2019s\n former deputy campaign chairman, testified against his former boss Paul \nManafort, Manafort\u2019s lawyer grilled him, asking, \u201cAfter all the lies you\u2019ve told\n and fraud you\u2019ve committed, you expect this jury to believe you?\u201d Giuliani \nhimself is under federal criminal investigation. In a 2018 text to Parnas \nrecently released by the House Intelligence Committee, Giuliani seemed to joke, \napropos of Robert Mueller, \u201cI\u2019m no rat,\u201d but should the prospect of prison ever \nchange his mind, expect Republicans to make a similar case against believing a \ncrooked and paranoid barfly. A willingness to associate with Trump is a sign of \nmoral turpitude, so most witnesses to his venal schemes will necessarily be \ncompromised. Thus nothing that Parnas said in the Maddow interview should be \ntaken at face value. Important questions remain unanswered, including who was \npaying all of the bills. (Remember \u2014 he was paying Giuliani, not vice versa.) \nParnas\u2019s decision to go public in the first place is hard to fathom. None of \nthat, however, means that his dramatic interview on the eve of Trump\u2019s \nimpeachment trial shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. That\u2019s because much of what he \nsays has been corroborated, and because the very fact that a person like Parnas \nwas carrying out high-level international missions for the president shows how \nmob-like this administration is. You don\u2019t have to take Parnas\u2019s word that he \nwas working at the president\u2019s behest. Last fall, when House impeachment \ninvestigators asked for documents and testimony from Parnas and his associate, \nIgor Fruman, they were initially represented by John Dowd, formerly one of \nTrump\u2019s defense lawyers in the Mueller inquiry. Dowd, in turn, wrote to Congress\n that Parnas and Fruman would not cooperate with the impeachment investigation \nbecause some of the information the House sought may have been privileged. \u201cBe \nadvised that Messers. Parnas and Fruman assisted Mr. Giuliani in connection with\n his representation of President Trump,\u201d the letter said. (Documents that Parnas\n later provided to the House Intelligence Committee show that Trump signed off \non Dowd representing them.) Some of the most disturbing and clarifying \ninformation Parnas has provided since turning on Trump involves the \nadministration\u2019s fixation on Marie Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador \nto Ukraine. It\u2019s true that people around Trump saw her as an obstacle to getting\n Ukraine\u2019s government to open a politically motivated investigation into Joe \nBiden and his son, Hunter, but that doesn\u2019t quite explain the scale of the \nanimosity toward her. Trump didn\u2019t just fire her. He told Volodymyr Zelensky, \nthe Ukrainian president, that she was going to \u201cgo through some things.\u201d We \nlearned this week that Robert Hyde, a deranged Trumpworld hanger-on and \nRepublican congressional candidate, sent a series of messages to Parnas \nsuggesting he was stalking Yovanovitch. (Ukraine has opened an investigation \ninto Hyde\u2019s activity, and on Thursday he was visited by the F.B.I.) A lawyer and\n Fox News regular named Victoria Toensing \u2014 who has represented a Kremlin-\naligned Ukrainian oligarch who is, according to the Justice Department, an \nupper-echelon associate of Russian organized crime figures \u2014 texted Giuliani \nsaying, \u201cIs there absolute commitment for her to be gone this week?\u201d Why the \nobsession with Yovanovitch? Parnas added to the evidence that when it came to \nYovanovitch, Trump and his crew willingly allowed themselves to be manipulated \nby Yuri Lutsenko, a disgraced former chief prosecutor of Ukraine who loathed her\n for her anti-corruption work. (As the State Department official George Kent \nsaid during the impeachment hearings, you can\u2019t fight corruption \u201cwithout \npissing off corrupt people.\u201d) In WhatsApp messages to Parnas, Lutsenko expressed\n fury that Yovanovitch hadn\u2019t been fired yet. He spoke of all he\u2019d done to push \nthe spurious Biden scandal, adding, \u201cAnd yet you can\u2019t even get rid of one \nfool.\u201d \u201cIn that text message to you,\u201d Maddow asked on Thursday, \u201cis Mr. Lutsenko\n saying, in effect, listen, if you want me to make these Biden allegations, \nyou\u2019re going to have to get rid of this ambassador?\u201d Parnas replied: \n\u201cAbsolutely. Absolutely.\u201d A few months ago, I wrote a column arguing that when \nit comes to Ukraine, Trump is at once a con man and a mark, and the information \nParnas has provided backs this up. Having promised Lutsenko that he\u2019d get \nYovanovitch fired, Parnas told Trump, falsely, that Yovanovitch had bad-mouthed \nhim. His text messages show that he pushed Donald Trump Jr. to tweet about her. \nParnas was the vehicle through which a dirty Ukrainian politician pulled Trump\u2019s\n strings to take revenge on an American official who\u2019d tried to uphold the rule \nof law. She was threatened, smeared and fired in part because Trump is easily \ninfluenced by the goons and bottom feeders in his orbit. By going public, Parnas\n has probably done nothing to sway Republicans toward removing Trump from \noffice, not because they don\u2019t believe him, but because they know Trump did what\n he\u2019s accused of and don\u2019t care. Writing to Politico\u2019s John F. Harris, a Trump \nsupporter recently described the president as \u201cour O.J.,\u201d an apt analogy for \nRepublicans\u2019 vengeful determination to give a guilty man impunity. (As it \nhappens, Trump will be represented by one of O.J. Simpson\u2019s old lawyers, Alan \nDershowitz, at his Senate trial.) But Parnas is worth paying attention to \nbecause he\u2019s shown us, once again, what Trumpism looks like from the inside. \nIt\u2019s part \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and part, as he put it to Maddow, a \u201ccult.\u201d The \nqualities that discredit Parnas are the same ones that let him fit right in.

            "full_text": " Another Thing Tom Steyer Is Wrong About Proponents of\n term limits are either na\u00efve or cynical \u2014 sometimes both. By Jamelle Bouie \nOpinion Columnist The Iowa caucuses are on the horizon and impeachment is in the\n news, but let\u2019s set those aside to talk about something a little less urgent \u2014 \nyet still worthy of scorn. Term limits. A favorite of many would-be reformers, \nthe call to limit legislative tenure is popular with a majority of Americans, \nwho tend to dislike and distrust Congress. The Republican Party included term \nlimits in its 1988 and 1992 national platforms, as well as in its \u201cContract With\n America\u201d ahead of the 1994 congressional elections. More recent support comes \nfrom President Trump, who endorsed them during his 2016 campaign for president \n(although he likes to joke about serving past two terms). Right now, the loudest\n voice for term limits is Tom Steyer, the billionaire political activist and \ncandidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has put them at the \ncenter of his campaign, part of his plan to reform the government in Washington.\n He wants a 12-year total limit for lawmakers: two terms in the Senate, six \nterms in the House or some combination of the two. Steyer\u2019s website states that \n\u201cour elected officials are out of touch with our needs and are more focused on \ngetting re-elected than actually doing what\u2019s right\u201d and that \u201cthe longer an \nelected official stays in office, the more beholden they become to corporate \nbackers and special interest groups.\u201d Steyer is emphatic on this point. \u201cThe \nAmerican people are demanding term limits!\u201d he said on Twitter last weekend. \n\u201cServing in Congress shouldn\u2019t be a lifetime appointment.\u201d This sentiment \u2014 born\n of frustration with corruption, gridlock and polarization \u2014 is understandable. \nBut Steyer, and the three-quarters of Americans who support term limits, are \nmistaken. Far from fixing Congress, term limits would undermine its power and \nsupercharge the worst problems in Washington. It\u2019s worth saying, to start, that \nthe \u201cproblem\u201d of long-serving lawmakers \u2014 the problem a term limit purports to \nsolve \u2014 isn\u2019t actually a problem at all. The congressional scholar Josh Huder \nnotes that just 35 senators (and less than a third of the House) have served 10 \nyears or more. Likewise, according to a recent report from the Congressional \nResearch Service, average tenure in the past two Congresses sat at roughly 10 \nyears. Long-serving lawmakers are highly visible \u2014 often because they occupy key\n leadership roles \u2014 but they aren\u2019t particularly common. Not that this would be \na problem, even if it were true. Time in office doesn\u2019t inexorably lead to poor \nperformance \u2014 just the reverse. It\u2019s no coincidence that some of the most \neffective lawmakers in American history \u2014 architects of epochal bills like the \nSocial Security Act and the National Labor Relations Act \u2014 served for decades \naccumulating political and legislative expertise. And if voters want to reward \nan effective legislator or representative with more time in office, they should \nhave that right. Forced retirement cuts against the idea that voters have an \nabsolute right to choose their representatives. If the goal of term limits is to\n bring new faces and fresh ideas to Washington, then the solution isn\u2019t a \nblanket restriction on all lawmakers. The solution is more competition, to make \nit easier for interested people to run for office and win. There are ways to \nmake that happen. Nonpartisan redistricting in all 50 states would break \npartisan gerrymandering and force incumbents to compete for votes. Public \nfinancing of campaigns would give challengers a fighting chance in a general \nelection. And if part of the problem is low turnout, you can lower the barrier \nto voting and increase participation through universal registration and mail-in \nballoting. In addition to making career politicians extinct, term limits are \nalso supposed to limit corruption, gridlock and polarization. Limit the tenure \nof office, goes the argument, and lawmakers will be on a deadline to get \nsomething done. End the unceasing pressure of re-election and there\u2019s no \nincentive to raise money from wealthy interests. Mandate turnover and there\u2019s no\n chance to build entrenched power. None of that is true. Several states, \nincluding Steyer\u2019s own, California, have strict term limits for lawmakers. We \ncan see how they play out. And the results aren\u2019t good. In term-limited states, \nconstant turnover leaves legislatures with little expertise. Power is \ndistributed away from the statehouse and to other institutional actors, from \ngovernors \u2014 who are also term-limited but use state bureaucracies and party \nmachinery to work their will \u2014 to large interest groups and lobbyists. That last\n point is critical. Lawmaking is difficult, and expertise has to come from \nsomewhere. In the absence of experienced legislators, that expertise comes from \ninterested actors, people who know something because they need something. States\n with term limits produce representatives who have to rely on industry interests\n for knowledge, expertise and institutional memory. Instead of inhibiting \ncorporate influence, term limits sometimes lead to tighter relationships between\n lawmakers and outside interests. A term-limited Congress, in all likelihood, is\n a weak Congress, where inexperienced members are bullied by the White House and\n even more dependent on lobbyists, where there\u2019s little capacity to devise \nlegislation and less interest in long-term problem solving. It\u2019s easy to \nunderstand why anti-government conservatives would want to limit time in office \n\u2014 they don\u2019t want experienced lawmakers. As a first-time candidate for office \nrunning for the presidency, Steyer may not appreciate the benefits of political \nexperience. But as an ostensible progressive, he should also understand the \nimportance of a strong, capable legislature. I\u2019ve focused on the practical \nproblems with legislative term limits. There are additional, deeper issues. At \nbest, term limits appeal to the \u201cgood government\u201d instincts that gave us \nreferendums and recall elections (incidentally, Steyer wants national \nreferendums as well). But I also think they appeal to our most cynical \ninstincts, to the Trumpian refrain that all politics is a waste and all \npoliticians are crooks and liars. And as with the unintended consequences of \nterm limits, the unintended consequence of that view is to empower actual crooks\n and actual liars, who don\u2019t care for government or governance and hold the \ntruth itself in contempt.

            "full_text": " The Bernie Sanders Fallacy No, Virginia, there is no \nclass war. By David Brooks Opinion Columnist This is a golden age for \u201cTheyism.\u201d\n This is the belief that there is some malevolent, elite \u201cthey\u201d out there and \n\u201cthey\u201d are destroying life for the rest of us. There is Donald Trump\u2019s culture-\nwar Theyism: The coastal cultural elites hate genuine Americans, undermining our\n values and opening our borders. And there is Bernie Sanders\u2019s class-war \nTheyism: The billionaires have rigged the economy to benefit themselves and \nimpoverish everyone else. Each of these stories takes a genuine tension in \nsociety and blows it up into an all-explaining cartoon in which one part of \nAmerica is trying to destroy the other part. The G.O.P. has been swallowed by \nTrump\u2019s culture war, and many Democrats seem to be rushing to join Sanders\u2019s \nclass war. These Democrats are doing this even though it\u2019s political suicide. \nClass-war progressivism always loses to culture-war conservatism because swing \nvoters in the Midwest care more about their values \u2014 guns, patriotism, ending \nabortion, masculinity, whatever \u2014 than they do about proletarian class \nconsciousness. Democrats are doing this even though the Sanders class-war story \nis wrong. Sanders starts with a truth: Workers need more bargaining power as \nthey negotiate wages with their employers. But then he blows this up into an \nall-explaining ideology: Capitalism is a system of exploitation in which \ncapitalist power completely dominates worker power. This ideology crashes \nagainst the facts. In the first place, over the past few years wages for workers\n toward the bottom of the income stream have been rising faster than wages for \nthose toward the top. If the bosses have the workers by the throat, how can this\n be happening? Second, wages are still generally determined by skills and \nproductivity. For example, Edward Lazear of Stanford University finds that \nbetween 1989 and 2017, productivity in mostly high-skill industries rose by \nroughly 34 percent and wages in those industries rose by 26 percent. \nProductivity in industries with mostly less-skilled workers rose by 20 percent \nwhile wages grew by 24 percent. As Michael Strain of the American Enterprise \nInstitute puts it, capitalism is doing what it\u2019s supposed to do. It\u2019s rewarding \nproductivity with pay, and some people and companies are more productive. If you\n improve worker bargaining power, that may help a bit, but over the long run \npeople can\u2019t earn what they don\u2019t produce. Third, and most important, most of \nthe increase in earnings inequality has happened between companies, not within \nthem. As John Van Reenen of M.I.T. has found, all over the world superstar \nbusinesses are racing ahead of their competitors. As those companies grow more \nproductive, they earn more profit per employee and pay their workers more. \nCompanies that can\u2019t match that productivity don\u2019t, and their workers lag \nbehind. A recent Brookings Institution/Chumir Foundation report also notes that \nthere is a growing productivity gap between superstar companies and everybody \nelse. Whether it is in tech, retail, manufacturing, utilities or services, \nproductivity growth at the leading companies in each industry has remained very \nstrong. Those productive businesses are capturing larger and larger market \nshares. But productivity is not growing fast among the lagging companies. \nWorkers in those businesses suffer. Today\u2019s successful bosses are doing what \nthey should be doing: increasing productivity, growing their businesses and \noffering great service. A side effect of their efficiency is they spend a \nsmaller share of their revenue on labor even while raising their workers\u2019 wages.\n In a global information-age economy, the rewards for being best are huge. Thus,\n the core problem is not capitalists exploiting their workers; it\u2019s the rise of \nproductivity inequality. It\u2019s the companies and individuals who don\u2019t have the \nskills to take advantage of new technologies. The real solution, therefore, is \nnot class war to hammer successful businesses. It\u2019s to boost and expand \nproductivity for everybody else. That\u2019s done the old-fashioned way \u2014 by having \nbetter schools and better vocational training, by having more open competitive \nmarkets, by creating incentives to expand investment, by making sure superstar \nbusinesses don\u2019t use lobbyists to lock in their advantages. I understand if you \nwant to stick to an us-versus-them political ideology. It\u2019s emotionally \nsatisfying to base your political ideology on blaming people you dislike. In \nfact, I strongly recommend Michael Lind\u2019s new book, \u201cThe New Class War,\u201d which \nis the best version of us/them. Lind makes a lot of vague generalizations about \nthe \u201cmanagerial elite,\u201d which he blames for our problems. But at least he\u2019s \ninteresting and provocative. At least he understands that a politically \nplausible \u201cTheyism\u201d is economically left and socially right \u2014 combining the \nculture war and class war into a tidy narrative. But if you want to deal with \nour real problems, stop the us/them warfare and start dealing with productivity \ninequality. Successful executives are doing what\u2019s best for their companies, \ngathering as much talent as they can. This isn\u2019t evil. It\u2019s not exploitation. \nThe job of public policy is to make it easier for everybody to do what \nsuccessful people are doing. Productivity is the key to national prosperity. \nEvery time we increase productivity for one person, we all thrive a little more,\n together. ",
