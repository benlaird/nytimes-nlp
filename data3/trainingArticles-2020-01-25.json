            "full_text": " My Piece of the American Id Does equality in the age \nof Trump mean I can be irrationally angry, too? By Erin Aubry Kaplan \nContributing Opinion Writer The president\u2019s freewheeling racism, emanating year \nafter year from the top of the American political order, has made me more \nhostile toward white folks and whiteness than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. Despite\n the fact that I\u2019ve written provocatively (so I\u2019m told) about racial matters for\n years, this hostility is new \u2014 and I\u2019m increasingly unafraid to express it. \nLike all people of color, I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of racial \nmicroaggressions for as long as I can remember, but being the perpetrator of \nthis sort of macroaggression is a new and alarming phenomenon. It\u2019s unsettling \nmostly because it is addictive, like a drug that unlocks a kind of emotional \nfreedom I\u2019ve never been allowed to explore before. A couple of weeks ago, my dog\n woke up with a nasty ear infection, and I found myself at the reception desk of\n a specialty vet practice's emergency room, filling out forms to check her in. \nAs usual, I was the only black person there. As I completed the forms, the \nreceptionist \u2014\u00a0a young white woman \u2014\u00a0turned to me and said, pointing a finger, \n\u201cGo sit down.\u201d Her voice was flat, with none of the cheer or empathy she\u2019d just \nshown a white pet owner. Say what? Instantly, I was indignant. \u201cI\u2019m sorry? Sit \ndown?\u201d She didn\u2019t respond, which made me more indignant \u2014 oh, now she was \nignoring me? \u201cWhy should I sit down? Am I bothering you? Is there a problem?\u201d My\n voice was louder than it needed to be, and scornful. I wasn\u2019t having it. I was \nnot going to sit down. Over the top? Maybe. But the new, alarming truth is that \nI didn\u2019t care. At all. I suppose this was inevitable in the age of Donald Trump.\n Before his election, I had a wariness about racism that was abstract and low \nkey; it noted things, like being the only black person in an E.R., but it was \nchiefly interested in gathering information, reflecting, analyzing. Now, that \nracial awareness has become visceral and overstimulated. When something racially\n questionable happens, I tend to leap immediately to anger. This happens even \nwhen I know distinctly I shouldn\u2019t leap. But it doesn\u2019t matter. And why should \nit matter? In this Trump age of gross unreason, meeting incivility with civility\n has felt small to me, and futile. More and more, it feels as if the only way to\n be heard and understood is to give back exactly what I\u2019m getting, not just from\n bilious Mr. Trump but from his base, otherwise known as my fellow Americans. \nThat fact alone \u2014 that we are all Americans \u2014 has become infuriating. Watching \nthose outrageous Trump rallies especially puts me on edge, seeing those red \nfaces taunting Mexicans, Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, in eager unison. The anger\n that was drawn to the surface in 2016 and stayed there quickly boils over. I \nfeel like a fool for believing in racial harmony, for being taught at an early \nage that it is fundamental to the American project. I feel \u2014 again \u2014 that \nMalcolm X was right, black people are wasting their time trying to win over \nwhite people when they so clearly have no interest in being won over. The fact \nthat our fates are intertwined \u2014 something even Malcolm eventually realized \u2014 \nmakes me not hopeful, as it once did, but angrier. I feel stuck in a terrible, \nlopsided marriage. The least I should be able to do in this dysfunctional \nrelationship is to vent my anger, not on paper or newsprint, but in the real \nworld, in real time. That\u2019s what a big chunk of Republican America is doing, \nwith zero regrets. I have become envious of that. I want true equality, 2020 \nstyle \u2014 the right to claim and fully express my own well-earned piece of the \nAmerican id. And yet, I know this is indulgent. Aggression for aggression\u2019s sake\n goes against the practice of generations of black struggle that have made \njustice bigger than everybody\u2019s anger, black and white. Going off on a white \nperson because she deserves it or because you can is not something Malcolm X, or\n Martin Luther King Jr., would have approved of \u2014 not because it\u2019s unwarranted \nbut because it\u2019s undisciplined. It\u2019s a waste of resources. And then there\u2019s the \nfact that public displays of anger are still risky for black folk. They might \nland you in jail, or at the very least on the wrong side of authority, \npotentially heaping injustice on top of waste. On the way out, I told the \nreceptionist I was sorry if I had been rude. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bad morning,\u201d I said. \nIt was true: I\u2019ve had bad mornings for three years. But she didn\u2019t accept my \napology. She looked away from me with a kind of wince, as if my contrition \npained her. Or it made her angry. In any case, she didn\u2019t respond, just as she \nhadn\u2019t responded to my salvo a half-hour earlier. I don\u2019t know if it was because\n I\u2019d been a jerk, or because I\u2019m black, or because I was more of a jerk in her \neyes for being black. I walked off deeply unsatisfied for not having an answer. \nI\u2019d had my say \u2014 twice \u2014 and things were no clearer. They were certainly no more\n equal. ",

            "full_text": " How Does a Nation Adapt to Its Own Murder? Australia \nis going up in flames, and its government calls for resilience while planning \nfor more coal mines. By Richard Flanagan Mr. Flanagan is a novelist. BRUNY \nISLAND, Australia \u2014 The name of the future is Australia. These words come from \nit, and they may be your tomorrow: P2 masks, evacuation orders, climate \nrefugees, ocher skies, warning sirens, ember storms, blood suns, fear, air \npurifiers and communities reduced to third-world camps. Billions of dead animals\n and birds bloating and rotting. Hundreds of Indigenous cultural and spiritual \nsites damaged or destroyed by bush fires, so many black Notre Dames \u2014 the \nphysical expression of Indigenous Australians\u2019 spiritual connection to the land \nsevered, a final violence after centuries of dispossession. Everywhere there is \na brittle grief, and it may be as much for what is coming as for what is gone. \nThe dairy farmer Farran Terlich, whose properties in the South Coast were razed \nin a firestorm that killed two of his friends, described the blaze as \u201ca raging \nocean.\u201d \u201cThese communities are destroyed across the board,\u201d he said, \u201cand most \npeople are running dead.\u201d Dead, too, is a way of life. Many homes will not be \nallowed to be rebuilt in threatened areas. Where they are allowed, they may not \nbe affordable because of new building codes; if built, they may not be \ninsurable. Local economies, like local ecosystems, may never recover. A new \nsurvey estimates that more than half of all Australians have been directly \naffected by the fires, with millions suffering adverse health effects. The \neconomic damage keeps growing, the total cost placed at about $100 billion \nAustralian dollars (more than $68 billion), and rising. Gross domestic product \nis already impacted. Australia\u2019s central bank has announced that it may be \nforced to buy up coal mines and other fossil fuel assets to avoid an economic \ncollapse. \u201cThis is what you can expect to happen,\u201d said Richard Betts, a \nprofessor of geography at Exeter University in Britain, if the temperature \nincreases by an average of three degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. \u201cIt\n tells us what the future world might look like.\u201d To describe this terrifying \nnew reality, a terrifying new idea: \u201comnicide.\u201d As used by Danielle Celermajer, \na professor of sociology at the University of Sydney specializing in human \nrights, the term invokes a crime we have previously been unable to imagine \nbecause we had never before witnessed it. Ms. Celermajer argues that \u201cecocide,\u201d \nthe killing of ecosystems, is inadequate to describe the devastation of \nAustralia\u2019s fires. \u201cThis is something more,\u201d she has written. \u201cThis is the \nkilling of everything. Omnicide.\u201d What does the future look like where omnicide \nis the norm? According to the American climatologist Michael Mann, \u201cIt is \nconceivable that much of Australia simply becomes too hot and dry for human \nhabitation.\u201d Australia\u2019s situation is now no different from that of low-lying \nPacific islands confronting imminent destruction from rising seas. Yet when last\n August those states protested against the Australian government\u2019s refusal to \nact on climate change, Australia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, \nsaid, \u201cI also get a little bit annoyed when we have people in those sorts of \ncountries pointing the finger at Australia and say we should be shutting down \nall our resources sector so that, you know, they will continue to survive.\u201d \nToday Australia has only one realistic chance to, you know, survive: Join other \ncountries like those Pacific nations whose very future is now in question and \nseek to become an international leader in fighting for far stronger global \naction on climate change. But to do that it would first have to take decisive \naction domestically. Anything less and Australia will be lost to its climate \ncatastrophe as surely as Tuvalu will be to rising oceans. And yet Prime Minister\n Scott Morrison argues that Australia is on track to \u201cmeet and beat\u201d its \npitifully low pledge, under the 2015 Paris climate accord, of cutting 2005-level\n greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent before 2030. Experts have \noverwhelmingly rejected Mr. Morrison\u2019s claim as false. Emissions have been \nincreasing on average since 2015. A recent study by Ndevr Environmental \nConsultants, a well-regarded environmental auditing company, calculated that the\n 2030 target will not be met until 2098. \u201cWe say emissions are going down and \nthey are going up. We say investment in renewables is higher than ever, but it\u2019s\n falling because of the policy mess we have created,\u201d an unnamed government \nmember of Parliament told The Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cIt is little wonder we \nhave no credibility on this issue.\u201d According to a recent United Nations report,\n what is happening in Australia is \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel \nexpansions,\u201d with proposals for 53 new coal mines. Australia\u2019s fossil fuel \nindustry is already huge, thanks to massive taxpayer subsidies \u2014 some $29 \nbillion in 2015, according to a 2019 paper by the International Monetary Fund. \nEvery Australian man, woman and child is underwriting their own apocalypse to \nthe tune of $1,198 a year. And yet only 37,800 people are employed in coal \nmining. According to John Hewson, a former leader of the conservative Liberal \nParty, Mr. Morrison \u201cis almost totally beholden to the fossil fuel lobby. \nSeveral of his senior staff are ex-coal executives; a couple of his key \nministers have coal industry links; fossil fuel companies are major donors.\u201d Mr.\n Morrison now claims he accepts that climate change and the fires are linked, a \nconnection he previously denied, and is talking up \u201cresilience and adaptation\u201d \nin response. But how does a nation adapt to its own murder? After some weeks of \nbeing widely criticized for his incompetent and emotionally stunted response to \nthe fires, Mr. Morrison is now implausibly arguing that hazard-reduction burns \nare more important than emissions reductions in dealing with bush fires, even \nthough eminent scientists and fire chiefs have repeatedly said this is untrue. \nIt\u2019s as if in the middle of the Blitz, Winston Churchill announced that rubble \nremoval was more important than dealing with the Luftwaffe in fighting Hitler. \nWith no measure to even contain domestic emissions, the government\u2019s policies \nare predictably supported by the fossil fuel industry and its fellow travelers, \nlike Siemens, which recently announced that it was pressing ahead with its work \nas a contractor on the controversial Adani coal mine. After notoriously \nprofiteering from the genocide of Europe\u2019s Jews, the company is now is willing \nto profiteer from the omnicide of Australia. If Mr. Morrison\u2019s government \ngenuinely believed the science, it would immediately put a price on carbon, \ndeclare a moratorium on all new fossil fuel projects and transfer the fossil \nfuel subsidies to the renewables industries. It would go to the next round of \nglobal climate talks in Glasgow in November allied with other nations on the \nfront line of this crisis and argue for quicker and deeper cuts to carbon \nemissions around the world. Anything less is to collaborate in the destruction \nof a country. But the government is intent on doing nothing. And to the names of\n those historic betrayers of their people \u2014 Vidkun Quisling, Benedict Arnold, \nMir Jafar \u2014 perhaps one day will be added that of Scott Morrison, the prime \nminister of Australia who, when faced with the historic tragedy of his country\u2019s\n destruction, dissembled, enabled, subsidized and oversaw omnicide, until all \nwas ash and even the future was no more.

            "full_text": " Notorious D.J.T. on Trial Fidget spinners and \nspinning Republicans make the best of a bad case for Donald John Trump. By \nMaureen Dowd Opinion Columnist Republicans know very well who they are. That\u2019s \nwhy it was such a juicy moment when Hakeem Jeffries, the congressman from \nBrooklyn and Democratic impeachment manager, quoted a lyric by fellow B-town \nnative son Biggie Smalls to rebut Jay Sekulow when the president\u2019s lawyer \ndisingenuously wondered, \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d Referring to the Democrats\u2019 crystal-\nclear case that Donald Trump abused his power and corrupted the highest office \nin the land, Jeffries proclaimed, \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t know, now you know.\u201d I went \nto the press gallery one afternoon to check out the tableau vivant. The \nvisitors\u2019 gallery was only half full, and there was none of the passion and \ntitillation that infused the Clinton impeachment, which also, oddly enough, \nrevolved around a power disparity between two people. One Democratic Senate \nstaffer mourned the apathy. \u201cOur phones aren\u2019t ringing,\u201d he told me. \u201cNobody \ncares. It\u2019s the saddest thing ever.\u201d One side of the room seemed to be smirking.\n Mitch McConnell is resorting to his Merrick Garland playbook. He\u2019ll let the \nDemocrats make all their noble points, but it\u2019s Kabuki. Republicans have \nperfected the dark art of \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see here, just keep moving.\u201d \nMcConnell long ago choreographed the end, with Democrats losing the argument and\n the acquitted scoundrel triumphantly sweeping into the Capitol to make his \nState of the Union address. At night, tipsy Republican staffers treated Senate \noffice buildings as a pub crawl, roaming the halls with celebratory bottles of \nwine. Some Republicans were paying attention at the trial \u2014 or wanted to be seen\n paying attention. Susan Collins was glued to the proceedings, as was the \nsenator to her left in a magma-colored shawl, Lisa Murkowski. Republicans like \nCollins who are vulnerable in 2020 have to be alert and figure out how to find \ntheir way out of the hearings without doing more political harm. A Trump \nconfidant told CBS News that Republican senators were warned, \u201cVote against the \npresident and your head will be on a pike.\u201d Seated at the back of the class, \nMitt Romney looked dutiful, and the thought must have crossed his mind that\u2019s \nhe\u2019s in a position to inflict payback on Trump for calling him \u201ca pompous ass\u201d \nand tricking him into an interview for secretary of state only to humiliate him.\n (Revenge is a dish best served with milk.) But more senators on the Republican \nside were telegraphing boredom. Lindsey Graham yawned and rearranged his yellow \npencil and went on walkabouts, later telling reporters, \u201cAbout the fourth time \nyou tell me the same thing is twice too much.\u201d He cleaved to his lap-dog role, \nsaying preposterously of Trump: \u201cWhat he wants to do is get to the truth.\u201d Tom \nCotton played with the fidget spinner Richard Burr had handed out to all the \nRepublicans. Marsha Blackburn and others left to trash the proceedings on Fox \nNews. The senators in the Democratic presidential race could not have been happy\n to be stuck there, either. Bernie Sanders, accustomed to making like Leonard \nBernstein at big rallies and upset he\u2019s not in Iowa to relish his surge, had a \nhard time keeping his hands still, moving them restlessly, silently clapping, \nand finally holding them together on his chest over his blue sweater. But heads \non both sides did snap to attention whenever that unholy, jangly, self-\nimpeaching peal, so inescapable in the last three years, rang out in the \nhallowed chamber. Trump\u2019s voice was impossible to ignore when the House \nimpeachment managers played incriminating video clips of the human fidget \nspinner himself, sometimes howling over the blades of his chopper on the South \nLawn. So many people in this very room had tried and failed, or are now trying, \nto vanquish the guy. Romney, Cruz, Rubio, Graham, Klobuchar, Sanders, Bennet, \nBooker, Gillibrand, Warren, Harris. Trump had savaged all his fellow Republicans\n and yet here they were listening to an unending recitation of his crimes and \ncoming out to be his Praetorian guard. Adam Schiff tried to warn the former \nnemeses turned defenders of Trump that if the president is not removed, he could\n turn on them the way he had turned on Marie Yovanovitch and Joe Biden, using \nthe power of the presidency to cheat, lie and smear. (Now Rudy\u2019s buddy Lev \nParnas says he has forked over to congressional Democrats a 2018 recording of \nTrump personally ordering Yovanovitch to be fired.) \u201cThe next time, it just may \nbe you,\u201d Schiff told the Republican senators. \u201cDo you think he wouldn\u2019t ask you \nto be investigated? Do you think for a moment that he wouldn\u2019t?\u201d Schiff also \nreminded Republicans that Trump had inverted their dogma, embracing the Evil \nEmpire and authoritarianism and trusting Crazy Rudy\u2019s conspiracy theories over \nhis own intelligence services. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize how important character is in \nthe highest office in the land until you don\u2019t have it,\u201d Schiff said. But the \nmore impressive the Democrats\u2019 case is, the more depressing the reality becomes.\n They want to convince themselves that character matters. But many Americans \nknew they were voting for a thug. They wanted a thug who would bust up \nWashington, and they got one. The Democrats are relying on facts, but the \nRepublicans are relying on Fox. And if you don\u2019t know, now you know. ",

            "full_text": " What if It Were Obama on Trial? Consider Trump\u2019s \nimpeachment from some other angles. By Nicholas Kristof Opinion Columnist What \nif it were President Barack Obama who was the subject of the Senate impeachment \ntrial? How would we feel then? Cass Sunstein, a professor at Harvard Law School,\n suggests a question along those lines in his book \u201cImpeachment: A Citizen\u2019s \nGuide.\u201d It\u2019s one of several thought experiments that I suggest in order to step \nback from the hurly-burly in the Senate and interrogate our own principles and \nmotivations. The first approach, as Sunstein puts it, is this: \u201cSuppose that a \npresident engages in certain actions that seem to you very, very bad. Suppose \nthat you are tempted to think that he should be impeached. You should \nimmediately ask yourself: Would I think the same thing if I loved the \npresident\u2019s policies, and thought that he was otherwise doing a splendid job?\u201d \nAlternatively, if you oppose impeachment and removal, Sunstein suggests you ask \nyourself: \u201cWould I think the same thing if I abhorred the president\u2019s policies, \nand thought that he was otherwise doing a horrific job?\u201d In practical terms, \nthis amounts to: What if it were Obama who had been caught in this Ukraine \nscandal? My guess is that if it were Obama, Republicans would be demanding \nwitnesses (as they did in the 1999 trial of Bill Clinton). Given how \naggressively Republican members of Congress pursued the Benghazi events \u2014 \nmultiple investigations, eventually finding no evidence of wrongdoing by either \nObama or then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2014 I\u2019m confident that the G.O.P.\n would be insisting that Obama be removed, with frequent chants of \u201clock him \nup.\u201d Yet I suspect that many Democrats would also switch sides, finding it \neasier to excuse misconduct by someone they admired \u2014 and seeing it as more \nimportant in that situation to preserve executive privilege and leave it to \nvoters to decide the matter in the fall. That\u2019s why we owe it to ourselves, as a\n matter of intellectual honesty, to think through how we would react if it were \nthe other guy on trial. (Progressives may be scoffing that this exercise is \nunrealistic: Obama was meticulous in avoiding scandal and ethical conflicts. He \nchecked with the Justice Department before accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, and \nfor him a \u201cscandal\u201d was something like wearing a tan suit. The Ukraine mess \nwould have been out of character for Obama, while it is entirely in character \nfor Trump. But Republicans will see this differently.) The second thought \nexperiment comes from another distinguished lawyer, Neal Katyal, in his new book\n \u201cImpeach: The Case Against Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cImagine if it had worked,\u201d Katyal \nsuggests. \u201cImagine if our president had leveraged his role as commander in chief\n to convince a foreign power to open an investigation into his political \nopponent. Imagine if the president\u2019s rival lost the primary because news broke \nthat he was under investigation. Imagine if that meant the president faced a \nweaker candidate in November 2020 \u2014 and won re-election as a result.\u201d The \nforeign country could then blackmail our president by threatening to expose the \ncorruption, gaining leverage over our foreign policy. Meanwhile, the president \nmight abuse presidential power in other ways in the belief that impunity was \ncomplete. If all this eventually became public, and truth does have a way of \ntrickling out, this would have devastating consequences for the legitimacy of \nAmerican elections. This thought experiment perhaps isn\u2019t so far-fetched. We \nknow now that Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine caused alarm in the White House and \nthe intelligence community, with National Security Adviser John Bolton likening \nit to a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d Yet for all that uproar, it almost didn\u2019t become public. It\n was only because of a whistle-blower that the information began to emerge, and \nthe military aid to Ukraine was released only after the White House became aware\n of the whistle-blower and was being pressured by Congress. In short, Trump\u2019s \nplan almost succeeded \u2014 and in any case, he will get away with it in the sense \nthat he is sure to be acquitted by the Senate. When Republicans suggest that \nTrump did nothing wrong, what message does that impunity send to Trump and to \nfuture presidents? The third thought experiment is simple: What if Trump weren\u2019t\n president, but was like almost any other person in America? What if he were a \nhigh school vice principal who ensured that a police detective\u2019s son would be \naccepted in advanced placement classes \u2014 and then added, \u201cI\u2019d like you to do us \na favor, though.\u201d The favor would be an investigation of the vice principal\u2019s \nex-wife before their upcoming child custody hearing, in hopes of tilting the \noutcome in his favor. In that situation, the vice principal would be fired. We \nall recognize that no school official or other person in a government \nbureaucracy should use public power for private benefit. So a last query: \nShouldn\u2019t we have as high a standard for the president of the United States as \nfor a school vice principal? ",

            "full_text": " Of All Trump\u2019s Defenses, This Is the Lamest Only the \nvoters can send the president packing? That\u2019s a joke. By Frank Bruni Opinion \nColumnist Once the Senate concludes its trial of President Trump, it should go \ninto recess. Until next January. The House, too. Lawmakers shouldn\u2019t pass \nlegislation, consider nominations or make any important decisions whatsoever: \nThis is an election year, and the voters will soon weigh in on the direction of \nAmerica. The nation\u2019s business should await that judgment, lest members of \nCongress contradict it. A ludicrous proposal? Indeed. But it\u2019s in line with \u2014 \nand an extrapolation of \u2014 a favorite argument against Trump\u2019s conviction and \nremoval from office. His Republican supporters say that lawmakers shouldn\u2019t \nspeak for voters on such a crucial issue. To pre-empt the verdict at the ballot \nbox, they say, is to subvert the people\u2019s will. Nice try. Lawmakers are elected \nspecifically to speak for voters on crucial issues. That\u2019s the system. That\u2019s \ntheir job. American government doesn\u2019t operate by daily, hourly or issue-by-\nissue polls (at least not overtly). Congress doesn\u2019t have exponentially more \npower one week after Election Day than it does one year later (though it may \nindeed have more political currency). And lawmakers shouldn\u2019t defer to their \nconstituents at every turn. Those constituents expect them, over the course of \ntheir legislative terms, to use their judgment as better-informed proxies for \nthe people they represent. So does the Constitution, which created America as a \nrepresentative democracy, not a direct one. Our lawmakers are supposed to lead \nas well as follow, to be responsive to public sentiment but not mesmerized or \nparalyzed by it. That\u2019s even truer when the stakes are huge than when they\u2019re \nsmall. Republicans have decided to sing a different tune. If it sounds familiar,\n that\u2019s because they turned to the same music when the Supreme Court justice \nAntonin Scalia died, President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace\n him and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, declared that a \npresidential election about eight months in the offing prevented the Senate from\n taking any action. It was a song not of principle but of political convenience.\n The same holds true now. \u201cGive the people back their power,\u201d the House minority\n leader, Kevin McCarthy, implored a few months ago, arguing against impeachment \nitself. Referring to the president\u2019s transgression and the November 2020 \nelection, McConnell said, \u201cThe American people, if they think this is a very \nsignificant episode, can take it into account.\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham chimed \nin: \u201cI really do believe that the best person \u2014 group of people \u2014 to pick a \npresident are the voters, not a bunch of partisan politicians.\u201d Pat Cipollone, \none of the president\u2019s lawyers, added: \u201cNo one ever thought that it would be a \ngood idea for our country \u2014 for our children, for our grandchildren \u2014 to try to \nremove a president from a ballot, to deny the American people the right to \nvote.\u201d No one? Really? How about the framers of the Constitution, who \nestablished the impeachment process to do essentially that and declined to add \nany asterisks about the next election\u2019s imminence? \u201cIf the framers thought \nimpeachment in an election year was a bad idea, they could have set things up \ndifferently,\u201d noted Jill Lepore, a Harvard history professor and the author of \nthe 2018 book \u201cThese Truths: A History of the United States.\u201d \u201cThey could have \ninstituted a mechanism for an interim election, for instance,\u201d Lepore told me. \n\u201cThey did not. They could have said, \u2018Except not in an election year.\u2019 They did \nnot. You want there to be no impeachments allowed in an election year, ever? You\n have to get a constitutional amendment ratified.\u201d And that would never happen, \nbecause it would be license for a president to do anything he or she wanted, \nfearlessly, if it synced with the calendar just so. The framers, in fact, wanted\n a government that wasn\u2019t too sensitive to voters \u2014 that mediated voters\u2019 whims \nand prejudices through representatives presumably taking a longer, cooler view. \nSenators\u2019 six-year terms reflect that. As Alison LaCroix, a University of \nChicago professor who teaches constitutional law and American history, told me, \n\u201cThe Senate is supposed to have a little more deliberative power and maybe be a \nlittle less beholden to the people.\u201d When senators say they should kick an issue\n back to the people, they\u2019re arguably violating the spirit of the chamber. \nLaCroix made another excellent point: What\u2019s happening to Trump isn\u2019t muscling \nvoters out of the process but, rather, taking into account what voters recently \ndid. \u201cYou only get an impeachment vote when people have changed their minds,\u201d \nshe said, referring to their opinions about a sitting president. \u201cThe votes \ncomes from the House, and we know, from things like the midterm elections, that \nsome amount of people have changed their minds. Another party has gained control\n of the House. That has to be telling us something.\u201d Granted, that switch in the\n House majority wasn\u2019t a referendum on Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine, which \nwere the grounds for his impeachment and hadn\u2019t yet come to light. But they were\n absolutely a referendum, in part, on his behavior and character. Lawmakers who \nare now assessing and acting on the worst of that behavior and character are \nhardly turning a deaf ear to voters. If Republican leaders were really so \ninvested in a government that didn\u2019t diverge from voters\u2019 desires, more of them \nwould be questioning the Electoral College. Because of it, the country has a \npresident, Trump, who received about three million fewer votes than his \nopponent. Because of it, George W. Bush won the 2000 presidential election \ndespite being the choice of fewer Americans than Al Gore. But both Trump and \nBush are Republicans. So it\u2019s fine if the system and voter sentiment aren\u2019t \nperfectly aligned. Similarly, Republicans \u2014 Democrats, too \u2014 are fond of tarring\n opponents by saying that they\u2019re too beholden to polls. The implication is that\n elected officials should have the courage of their own convictions and not \noutsource their judgment to constituents. Saying that only voters should decide \nTrump\u2019s fate is precisely such outsourcing. And Election Day is essentially the \nbiggest poll of all. There\u2019s an additional, profoundly important wrinkle in the \ncase of Trump\u2019s impeachment and trial. They stem specifically from actions he \ntook to corrupt the next presidential election by getting a foreign government \nto smear a potential rival. To give those actions a pass is to green-light more \nof the same or worse, meaning that voters\u2019 verdict on Trump\u2019s behavior might be \nfatally tainted: not a clean expression of popular will but a product of, well, \ncheating. The election can\u2019t be the remedy when the election is what\u2019s at issue.\n But McCarthy, McConnell and other Republicans are determined to spare their \nparty the humiliation of Trump\u2019s removal and to protect themselves from his \nwrath (and his base\u2019s fury) if he isn\u2019t saved. So they reach for whatever \narguments they can. Some are more plausible than others. The assertion that an \nelection next November forbids honor this January is a joke, and the framers \nwould have laughed at it. I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email \nnewsletter.

            "full_text": " Anyone but Trump? Not So Fast Let\u2019s not exchange one \nreckless president for another. By Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist Donald Trump \nis a lawless president and revolting person who richly deserved his impeachment \nand, in a better world, would be convicted in the Senate and removed from the \nWhite House. That\u2019s my view, as it is the view of a plurality \u2014 albeit a narrow \nplurality \u2014 of the American people. Ergo, every American who feels this way has \na moral obligation to vote for whoever winds up being the Democratic nominee, \neven if the nominee turns out to be Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Right? \nWell, hang on. I\u2019ve been thinking about this question for a while now, thanks \nmainly to some good-natured prodding from my colleague Gail Collins in our \npublished conversations. The strongest version of the argument is this: Say what\n you will about Warren\u2019s or Sanders\u2019s policies, neither candidate poses any \nserious threat to our constitutional order, just as neither possesses Trump\u2019s \ncrippling character flaws or has such contempt for the institutions, traditions \nand habits of a free and civilized society. In short, while a Warren or Sanders \npresidency might drastically rearrange the furniture in our common democratic \nhome, it will not \u2014 as Trump\u2019s has \u2014 seek to blast away at the foundations. \nWhat\u2019s more, a decisive loss by Trump might have the added benefit of chastening\n conservatives who abandoned their former \u201cfree people, free markets\u201d \nconvictions in favor of Trump\u2019s nativist demagogy. It\u2019s a serious argument that \ndeserves respect. But it falls short in three big ways. First, the argument \noverstates the extent to which this presidency has eroded the foundations of \nliberal democracy at home and abroad. Has Trump abandoned NATO? No. Has he \nlifted sanctions on Russia? No. Has he closed the borders to all immigrants? No.\n Did the president steal the midterms, or stop Congress from impeaching him? No.\n Has he significantly suppressed the press? Again, no. None of this should \ndiminish the extent to which Trump has repeatedly sought to do the wrong thing, \nor \u2014 nearly as bad \u2014 the ways in which he has normalized the seeking. Nor does \nit lessen my apprehensions about what Trump, after an acquittal in the Senate, \nmay seek to do with a second term. Yet for the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans, life is pretty much the same under Trump as it was under Obama. The \ntruth of Trumpism is that it\u2019s a morally corrosive and corrupting force, not a \npolitically or economically catastrophic one. It\u2019s a reality Trump\u2019s critics \nneed to internalize lest their criticism become a self-defeating caricature. \nSecond, the argument understates the radicalism of what Sanders and Warren \npropose. Theirs is not a painless policy massage in the direction of a kinder, \ngentler economy. It\u2019s a frontal and highhanded assault on American capitalism. \nIf it succeeded, it would entail devastating dislocations to millions of workers\n lasting for years. If it failed, it would have devastating effects on the \ncountry lasting for decades. How devastating? In October, Brian Riedl of the \nManhattan Institute tallied the costs of Mr. Sanders\u2019s policy goals. By his \ncalculations, the federal government would double in size. Half the American \nwork force would be employed by the government, Mr. Riedl writes. Government \nspending as a percent of G.D.P. would rise to 70 percent (in Sweden, it\u2019s less \nthan 50 percent). The 15.3 percent payroll tax would hit 27.2 percent to help \npay for Medicare for All. Total additional outlays would reach $97.5 trillion on\n top of the nearly $90 trillion the federal, state and local governments are \nprojected to spend over the next decade. At least Sanders is honest enough to \ncall this what it is: socialism. Warren\u2019s terminology is less forthright. Her \nambition is no less breathtaking. Fracking and health insurance \u2014 two industries\n that collectively employ hundreds of thousands of people \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be better-\nregulated or reformed in her administration. They\u2019d be abolished. Much of \nSilicon Valley, America\u2019s premier growth engine for 40 years, would be turned \ninto a quasi-public utility. She doesn\u2019t have one climate plan. She has at least\n five, costing in the trillions, which she plans to finance partly with a wealth\n tax that, as a law professor, she surely knows is unconstitutional. It\u2019s of a \npiece with the other dishonesties that are such a part of her political persona.\n Third, the argument ignores the likely effect that a Sanders or Warren \npresidency would have on the right. Chastening? Probably not. Neither candidate \nis any bit more interested in finding common ground with Republican-leaning \nvoters than Trump was interested in finding it with Democratic-leaning ones. And\n an assertively left-wing presidency would spark a right-wing backlash that \nwould have all of the fear and rage of the left\u2019s Resistance \u2014 but none of its \nrestraint. Democrats can, and hopefully will, nominate a candidate capable of \nattracting middle-of-the-road support. They can eschew polarization for \npersuasion and ideology for pragmatism. They can offer themselves as a sober \nalternative to a reckless president. What they can\u2019t do is nominate a reckless \ncandidate of their own and insist it\u2019s the only moral choice. For some of us, \nnone-of-the-above is a viable option. For far too many others, it\u2019ll be the \ndevil they know. ",
