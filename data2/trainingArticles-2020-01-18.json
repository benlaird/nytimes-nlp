            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by How Did Americans Lose Faith in Everything? Our \ninstitutions lost the capacity to mold character and have become platforms for \nperformance instead. By Yuval Levin Mr. Levin is the author of the forthcoming \n\u201cA Time to Build: From Family and Community to Congress and the Campus, How \nRecommitting to Our Institutions Can Revive the American Dream.\u201d Americans are \nliving through a social crisis. We can see that in everything from vicious \npartisan polarization to rampant culture-war resentments to the isolation, \nalienation and despair that have sent suicide rates climbing and driven an \nepidemic of opioid abuse. These dysfunctions appear to have common roots, but \none symptom of the crisis is that we can\u2019t quite seem to get a handle on just \nwhere those roots lie. When we think about our problems, we tend to imagine our \nsociety as a vast open space filled with individuals who are having trouble \nlinking hands. And so we talk about breaking down walls, building bridges, \nleveling playing fields or casting unifying narratives. But what we are missing \nis not simply greater connectedness but a structure of social life: a way to \ngive shape, purpose, concrete meaning and identity to the things we do together.\n If American life is a big open space, it is not a space filled with \nindividuals. It is a space filled with these structures of social life \u2014 with \ninstitutions. And if we are too often failing to foster belonging, legitimacy \nand trust, what we are confronting is a failure of institutions. This social \ncrisis has followed upon a collapse of our confidence in institutions \u2014 public, \nprivate, civic and political. But we have not given enough thought to just what \nthat loss of confidence entails and why it\u2019s happening. Each core institution \nperforms an important task \u2014 educating children, enforcing the law, serving the \npoor, providing some service, meeting some need. And it does that by \nestablishing a structure and process, a form, for combining people\u2019s efforts \ntoward accomplishing that task. But as it does so, each institution also forms \nthe people within it to carry out that task responsibly and reliably. It shapes \nbehavior and character, fostering an ethic built around some idea of integrity. \nThat\u2019s why we trust the institution and the people who compose it. We trust \npolitical institutions when they undertake a solemn obligation to the public \ninterest and shape the people who populate them to do the same. We trust a \nbusiness because it promises quality and reliability and rewards its workers \nwhen they deliver those. We trust a profession because it imposes standards and \nrules on its members intended to make them worthy of confidence. We trust the \nmilitary because it values courage, honor and duty in carrying out the defense \nof the nation and forms human beings who do, too. We lose faith in an \ninstitution when we no longer believe that it plays this ethical or formative \nrole of teaching the people within it to be trustworthy. This can happen through\n simple corruption, when an institution\u2019s attempts to be formative fail to \novercome the vices of the people within it, and it instead masks their treachery\n \u2014 as when a bank cheats its customers, or a member of the clergy abuses a \nchild. That kind of gross abuse of power obviously undermines public trust in \ninstitutions. It is common in our time as in every time. But for that very \nreason, it doesn\u2019t really explain the exceptional collapse of trust in American \ninstitutions in recent decades. What stands out about our era in particular is a\n distinct kind of institutional dereliction \u2014 a failure even to attempt to form \ntrustworthy people, and a tendency to think of institutions not as molds of \ncharacter and behavior but as platforms for performance and prominence. In one \narena after another, we find people who should be insiders formed by \ninstitutions acting like outsiders performing on institutions. Many members of \nCongress now use their positions not to advance legislation but to express and \nact out the frustrations of their core constituencies. Rather than work through \nthe institution, they use it as a stage to elevate themselves, raise their \nprofiles and perform for the cameras in the reality show of our unceasing \nculture war. President Trump clearly does the same thing. Rather than embodying \nthe presidency and acting from within it, he sees it as the latest, highest \nstage for his lifelong one-man show. And he frequently uses it as he used some \nof the stages he commanded before he was elected: to complain about the \ngovernment, as if he were not its chief executive. The pattern is rampant in the\n professional world. Check in on Twitter right now, and you\u2019ll find countless \njournalists, for instance, leveraging the hard-earned reputations of the \ninstitutions they work for to build their personal brands outside of those \ninstitutions\u2019 structures of editing and verification \u2014 leaving the public unsure\n of just why professional reporters should be trusted. The same too often \nhappens in the sciences, in law and in other professions meant to offer \nexpertise. Or consider the academy, which is valued for its emphasis on the \npursuit of truth through learning and teaching but which now too often serves as\n a stage for political morality plays enacted precisely by abjuring both. Look \nat many prominent establishments of American religion and you\u2019ll find \ninstitutions intended to change hearts and save souls frequently used instead as\n yet more stages for livid political theater \u2014 not so much forming those within \nas giving them an outlet. Artists and athletes often behave this way too, using \nreputations earned within institutional frameworks as platforms for building a \nprofile outside them. When he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of \nFame, the former Chicago Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg implored fellow \nplayers to remember \u201cthat learning how to bunt and hit-and-run and turning two \nis more important than knowing where to find the little red light on the dugout \ncamera.\u201d When vital institutions across American life fail to produce people who\n remember that, they become much harder to trust. The few exceptions to the \npattern of declining confidence in institutions tend to prove this rule. The \nmilitary is the most conspicuous exception and also the most unabashedly \nformative of our national institutions \u2014 molding men and women who clearly take \na standard of behavior and responsibility seriously. And that can help us see \nwhat we might do to help alleviate the social crisis we confront. All of us have\n roles to play in some institutions we care about, be they familial or communal,\n educational or professional, civic, political, cultural or economic. Rebuilding\n trust in those institutions will require the people within them \u2014 that is, each\n of us \u2014 to be more trustworthy. And that must mean in part letting the distinct\n integrities and purposes of these institutions shape us, rather than just using\n them as stages from which to be seen and heard. As a practical matter, this can\n mean forcing ourselves, in little moments of decision, to ask the great unasked\n question of our time: \u201cGiven my role here, how should I behave?\u201d That\u2019s what \npeople who take an institution they\u2019re involved with seriously would ask. \u201cAs a \npresident or a member of Congress, a teacher or a scientist, a lawyer or a \ndoctor, a pastor or a member, a parent or a neighbor, what should I do here?\u201d \nThe people you most respect these days probably seem to ask that kind of \nquestion before they make important judgments. And the people who drive you \ncrazy, who you think are part of the problem, are likely those who clearly fail \nto ask it when they should. Asking such questions of ourselves would be a first \nstep toward grasping our responsibilities, recovering the great diversity of \ninterlocking purposes that our institutions ought to serve, and constraining \nelites and people in power so that the larger society can better trust them. It \nwould not be a substitute for institutional reforms but a prerequisite for them.\n And asking such questions is one thing we all can do to take on the complicated\n social crisis we are living through and begin to rebuild the bonds of trust \nessential for a free society.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Starr Chamber: The Sequel President Trump reaches \ndeep into the perv barrel for his defense team. By Maureen Dowd Opinion \nColumnist Can a woman be president of the United States? Hell, yes. I\u2019ve covered\n the men who run the world my whole life. And there have been a lot of screw-\nups, from Vietnam to Watergate to Afghanistan to Iraq to pushing the economy off\n a cliff. There has also been plenty of creepy behavior, culminating in the news\n that Donald Trump, Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz have joined together in a \npervy, hypocritical cabal to argue that Trump did not smirch the Constitution. \nSo please, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, stop whingeing about sexism and \njust show how you could wield power like a boss. Ibid: Nancy Pelosi. When Steve \nBannon called Pelosi a \u201ctotal assassin,\u201d according to the hot new book \u201cA Very \nStable Genius,\u201d by Washington Post writers Phil Rucker and Carol Leonnig, he \nmeant it as the highest compliment. You won\u2019t find Pelosi keening about gender; \nshe\u2019s too busy taking care of business. Hillary Clinton did not lose because she\n was a woman. She faced sexism, of course, just as Barack Obama faced racism. \nShe lost because she ran an entitled, joyless, nose-in-the air campaign and \nbecause she didn\u2019t emulate her husband\u2019s ethos of campaign \u2019til the last dog \ndies and the last bowling alley closes, and always make it about the voters. She\n lost because she and her campaign manager, Robby Mook, didn\u2019t listen to Bill \nClinton, the world\u2019s leading expert on the white, male, rural vote, when he \nwarned them that there was trouble and offered to help out. Donald Trump \noperates from the id, which is fitting because he represents a last-gasp primal \nscream from working-class Americans threatened by the changes transforming the \ncountry. Women are now a majority of the work force and whites are heading \ntoward a minority status. Hollywood cannot cling to its benighted \u2014 and self-\ndefeating \u2014 desire to stay a white male club forever, despite the fact that \nwomen have always made up half the audience. Trump\u2019s ascent does not make it \nharder for women to ascend \u2014 just the opposite. Look at the throng of women who \nwere outraged enough about Trump to march and run and get elected in 2018. Once \na woman electrifies Democrats the way J.F.K., Bill Clinton and Obama did \u2014 and \nthe way Trump does his base \u2014 she will win. Trump is once more doing his part to\n energize women voters. On Friday, we learned that the president will get help \nfrom Starr and Dershowitz for the impeachment trial in the Senate. The Starr \nchamber was a shameful period of American history, with the prissy Puritan \nindependent counsel hounding and virtually jailing Monica Lewinsky and producing\n hundreds of pages of panting, bodice-ripping prose that read more like bad \nerotica than a federal report, rife with lurid passages about breasts, stains \nand genitalia. Like the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale and other Pharisaic Holy Rollers \nbefore him, the prosecutor who read the Bible and sang hymns when he jogged \nbecame fixated on sex in an unhealthy, warped way. Even Trump was appalled. \n\u201cStarr\u2019s a freak,\u201d the bloviating builder told me back in 1999. \u201cI bet he\u2019s got \nsomething in his closet.\u201d In other interviews, he called Starr \u201ca lunatic,\u201d \u201ca \ndisaster\u201d and \u201coff his rocker,\u201d and expressed sympathy for Hillary having to \nstand by her man when he was \u201cbeing lambasted by this crazy Ken Starr, who is a \ntotal wacko.\u201d Starr, who once clutched his pearls over Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual \nhigh jinks, is now going to bat for President \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d After playing \nan avenging Javert about foreplay in the Oval, Starr will now do his utmost to \nprove that a real abuse of power undermining Congress and American foreign \npolicy is piffle. In 2007, he defended Jeffrey Epstein. By 2016, Starr was being\n ousted as president of Baptist Baylor University for failing to protect women \nand looking the other way when football players were accused and sometimes \nconvicted of sexual assaults. In other words, he\u2019s a complete partisan hack who \ndoesn\u2019t give a damn about sexual assault. And then there\u2019s Dershowitz, whose \npast clients have included such sterling fellows as Epstein, Claus von B\u00fclow, \nO.J. Simpson and Harvey Weinstein. How did he miss Ted Bundy? Still, Dershowitz \nhas put himself on the side of an impressive pantheon of villainy in the realm \nof violence against girls and women. Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew\u2019s accuser, \nhas also claimed that she was offered as a teenager to Dershowitz for sex \u2014 a \ncontention that Dershowitz has denied in a countersuit. On Fox News, Dershowitz \nhas made the case that it is Pelosi who put herself above the law by delaying \nthe delivery of the articles of impeachment. Good luck with that one. The \nGovernment Accountability Office, a nonpartisan government watchdog, a few days \nago deemed that Trump\u2019s slimy Ukraine gambit violated a law. Yet Dershowitz will\n somehow argue that it doesn\u2019t represent high crimes and misdemeanors. He \ntweeted that he\u2019s nonpartisan because he opposed Bill\u2019s impeachment and voted \nfor Hillary, even as he joined up with Bill\u2019s persecutor. Dershowitz said that \nhe is participating \u201cto defend the integrity of the Constitution.\u201d That \nassertion may fly in Foxworld. But in the real world, it\u2019s ridiculous. You can \nbet that Trump and his buddies will continue to turn out the women\u2019s vote. The \nTimes is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Can Anyone Save the G.O.P.? Bill Weld tries a Granite\n State carom shot. By Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist Bill Weld, the former \nMassachusetts governor and current long-shot \u2014 make that, loooooooong-shot \u2014 \ncandidate for the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination, is a keen student \nof New Hampshire politics. In an interview with me this week, he noted the \nfollowing fact: Every time an incumbent president of either party faced a \nsignificant primary challenge in the Granite State, he failed in his bid for re-\nelection. It happened to George H.W. Bush in 1992 after Patrick Buchanan took 38\n percent of the New Hampshire vote. It happened to Jimmy Carter in 1980 after \nTeddy Kennedy took 39 percent. It happened to Gerald Ford in 1976 after Ronald \nReagan took 48 percent. It happened to Lyndon Johnson in 1968 after Eugene \nMcCarthy took 42 percent. It happened to Harry Truman in 1952 when Estes \nKefauver beat him outright, 55 percent to 44. So, Weld reasons, why not try to \nmake it happen to Donald J. Trump, too? That\u2019s the hopeful thought in what \notherwise seems to be Weld\u2019s hopeless bid to derail a president whose support \namong Republicans was 89 percent last month, according to Gallup. Weld is too \nmuch a politician to admit publicly that he sees no shot for himself of winning \n\u2014 a Messiah complex lies at the root of many monumental ambitions. But he\u2019s also\n wise enough to know that losing well can achieve great things, like bringing \ndown a president who, he said, \u201cregards the law as something to be evaded.\u201d Can \nthat be done between now and Feb. 11, the date of the New Hampshire primary? \nWeld rests his hopes on two things: New England Republicanism, which remains \nalive and well despite reports of its demise; and Trump\u2019s trial in the Senate, \nwhose result may not yet be a foregone conclusion. On the former, note that \nVermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire all have G.O.P. governors, who, like \nWeld, are relative moderates compared to the rest of the party. New England \nRepublicans can also be fickle in their loyalties, and late to make up their \nminds: Buchanan was also seen as a nonstarter against Bush Sr. just weeks before\n the 1992 primary.  On the latter, Weld knows a lot about the impeachment \nprocess, having worked on the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s staff as a young \nlawyer in 1974 as it considered articles against Richard Nixon. Nixon, Weld \nrecalled, \u201cwas essentially forced to withdraw from the presidency because he had\n been caught lying on television to the American people on one topic\u201d \u2014 a \nfoothill of a deception compared to Trump\u2019s Karakoram range. Weld also knows how\n quickly things can turn in the course of a trial. \u201cCases don\u2019t look the same at\n the end as they do at the beginning,\u201d he noted, recalling his prosecutions of \npublic corruption in the 1980s as United States attorney for the District of \nMassachusetts, where he won 109 convictions in 111 corruption cases. He believes\n that if four Republican senators join Democrats in voting to call witnesses \u2014 \nOhio\u2019s Rob Portman could provide the decisive vote \u2014 then anything is possible. \n\u201cThe one sport where the unthinkable can become the inevitable in a matter of \nweeks or even days,\u201d Weld said, \u201cis national politics, not the National Football\n League.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s right, assuming devastating testimony from John Bolton, \nthe former national security adviser; former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas;\n and who knows who (or what) else. Not that any kind of testimony is likely to \nsway the 67 senators needed for a conviction. But it\u2019s not quite out of the \nquestion that it might, in the coming weeks, sway a large fraction of New \nHampshire Republicans to vote against the president, thereby setting into motion\n forces that could bring him down. That\u2019s the hope, at any rate. The odds \nagainst? I\u2019d say 20 to 1 \u2014 which is to say, still worth a shot. If it fails, \nWeld said he would not run as an independent. Unlike in 2016, when he ran with \nGary Johnson on the Libertarian ticket (and won 4.5 million votes) he has no \ninterest in playing the spoiler to anyone in the race except Trump. The larger \nquestion if it fails is what becomes of the G.O.P. Weld compared the party to \nthe late-stage Whigs of the early 1850s, which were riven between the nativist \nKnow Nothing faction and the antislavery wing that would become the Republican \nParty of Abraham Lincoln. Fortunately, the good side won that time. And this \ntime? The best conservative case for rooting for a Democrat to win this fall \u2014 \nany Democrat, including Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren \u2014 is that it might be\n the only way to save the Republican Party from itself. That could happen if a \ncritical mass of conservatives repudiates Trumpism or forms a new party on the \nLincoln model. Weld calls it the Liberty Party. Alternatively a Sanders or \nWarren victory could send the G.O.P. to even further extremes. In politics, as \nin nature, forces always come in pairs. Democrats who want to see Republicans \nrecover their center need to protect their own. In the meantime, wish Bill Weld \nwell in his Granite State carom shot.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by How the \u2018Sharing\u2019 Economy Erodes Both Privacy and \nTrust To participate in services like Airbnb, you have to expose yourself. By \nLaurence Scott Mr. Scott is the author of \u201cPicnic Comma Lightning: The \nExperience of Reality in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d Our relationship to privacy \nis inseparable from our idea of trust. If you trust someone, you may be more \nwilling to divulge personal information to them. If you are highly protective of\n your privacy, you may seem to others to be distrustful. This is a normal social\n dynamic. But it is being cynically manipulated by the \u201csharing\u201d or \u201ctrust\u201d \neconomy \u2014 where we trade homes, cars or belongings through third-party \nadministrators such as Airbnb \u2014 in ways that threaten our privacy. The chief \nexecutive of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, has said that \u201cwe don\u2019t think you can be \ntrusted in a place where you\u2019re anonymous.\u201d In order to participate in services \nlike his, Mr. Chesky argues, you need to expose yourself. It\u2019s a model of \nconsumerism that depends on customers\u2019 transparency. It\u2019s also a model of \nconsumerism that makes our traditional idea of trust irrelevant. To trust \nsomeone is to assume that you can rely on them \u2014 that they do not need to be \nmonitored or policed. But the infrastructure of the sharing or trust economy is \nlargely a series of technical advances that enable us to track people \nconstantly, removing any need to trust them. Consider the smartphone app Doggy \nLogs, which allows a dog owner to remotely follow the exact movements of her \nprofessional dog walker as her dog is walked. Doggy Logs claims that its \nsoftware helps dog walkers \u201cincrease trust.\u201d But it\u2019s a peculiar sort of \u201ctrust\u201d\n that requires total surveillance. I\u2019ve seen this strange use of \u201ctrust\u201d \nelsewhere in the world of dog walking. A British-based company called Tailster \ndescribes its walkers as \u201ctrusted\u201d precisely because they are able to offer \ndigital evidence that the walk has taken place. What does it mean to be trusted \nin a transparent world? The proliferation of digital surveillance software is \nmaking the elimination of unmonitored, unaccountable moments an expected part of\n a business\u2019s service. Without private spaces, where life occurs beyond our \nvision or knowledge, there is no need for trust. In an open-plan world, \ntrustworthiness isn\u2019t so much a moral quality as a condition of not having to be\n trusted at all. Consider how the rise of the \u201cnanny cam\u201d is changing our idea \nof what constitutes a trustworthy babysitter. Once parents get used to reviewing\n the daily activities of their child-care providers, can they ever go back? Does\n the unrecorded nanny start to take on a somewhat sinister air? \u201cOh yes, the \nchildren will be safe with me,\u201d she promises, wishing you a good day at work and\n slowly closing the door behind you. The same goes for Uber\u2019s \u201cshared trip \nstatus,\u201d which allows a handful of your contacts to track your trip in real \ntime. If sharing our Uber location becomes the norm, will an untracked ride take\n on the suspense of a horror film? Will we be able to stomach these periods in \nwhich loved ones drop from digital view, becoming \u201cmissing persons\u201d for the \nduration of their journey? Can untracked drivers be trusted? These commercial \nendeavors are changing our attitudes toward private moments and private spaces. \nWe\u2019re encouraged to view privacy not as a desirable haven from the relentless \nexposure of public life, but as a zone of peril, an opportunity for \nuntrustworthy behavior. The suspicion of privacy is something we have seen in \nearlier eras. In the Tudor period in London, the design of homes changed, so \nthat communal layouts were replaced by a greater number of smaller enclosed \nrooms. While some scholars have argued that a longing for privacy drove this \narchitectural shift, the English professor Lena Cowen Orlin has suggested that \nvarious economic and practical factors were more often the impetus, and that the\n resulting privacy was an unwanted byproduct. As Ms. Orlin writes in her book \n\u201cLocating Privacy in Tudor London,\u201d \u201cprivacy inspired an uneasy mixture of \ndesire and distrust.\u201d In those newly enclosed chambers and secluded stairwells, \npeople could get up to no good. Likewise, the role of the chaperone has long \nbeen a way of making privacy respectable and, in a sense, not private at all. In\n the codified society of Edith Wharton\u2019s New York, for example, unchaperoned \nmeetings between the sexes were fraught with danger. Lily Bart, in Wharton\u2019s \n1905 novel \u201cThe House of Mirth,\u201d fears social ruin when she is tricked into \nvisiting a man alone, believing his wife to be sick in a room upstairs. When \nchaperones are the accepted convention, their absence inspires suspicion. The \ndigital surveillance technologies of today\u2019s trust economy are our new \nchaperones. Their demure presence, like that of the maiden aunt in the corner of\n the drawing room, are, paradoxically, vivid markers of distrust. Much of \ntoday\u2019s privacy debate assumes that precious parts of our lives are under threat\n from intrusive corporations and governments. And this is so. But at an even \nmore fundamental level, the design of our digital economy is steadily eroding \nthe temperamental qualities that we need in order to treasure privacy at all: \nour tolerance for opaqueness, uncertainty and disconnectedness \u2014 and our faith \nin the decency of others. Laurence Scott is the author, most recently, of \n\u201cPicnic Comma Lightning: The Experience of Reality in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d\n Like other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they \nread stories like this one.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Are My Friends\u2019 Deaths Their Fault or Ours? We need \nto move from pointing fingers to offering helping hands. By Nicholas Kristof \nOpinion Columnist When my wife and I wrote about my old schoolmates who had died\n from \u201cdeaths of despair,\u201d the reaction was sometimes ugly. \u201cThey killed \nthemselves,\u201d scoffed Jonathan from St. Louis, Mo., in the reader comments. \u201cIt \nwas self-inflicted.\u201d Ajax in Georgia was even harsher: \u201cNatural selection \nweeding out those less fit for survival.\u201d Our essay, drawn from our new book, \n\u201cTightrope,\u201d explored the disintegration of America\u2019s working class through the \nkids on my old No. 6 school bus in Yamhill, Ore., particularly my neighbors the \nKnapps. The five Knapp kids were smart and talented, but Farlan died after years\n of drug and alcohol abuse, Zealan died in a house fire while passed out drunk, \nNathan blew himself up cooking meth, Rogena died of hepatitis after drug use, \nand Keylan survived partly because he had spent 13 years in the Oregon State \nPenitentiary. Working-class men and women like them, of every shade, \nincreasingly are dying of \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d \u2014 from drugs, alcohol and suicide.\n That\u2019s why life expectancy in the United States, for the first time in a \ncentury, has declined for three years in a row. Plenty of readers responded with\n compassion. But there was a prickly scorn from some that deserves a response \nbecause it reflects an ideology that underlies so many failed policies. It \narises from the myth that we live in a land of limitless opportunity and that \nthose who struggle have simply made \u201cbad choices\u201d and failed to muster \u201cpersonal\n responsibility.\u201d Dr. Ben Carson, who grew up poor and black in Detroit and is \nnow the nation\u2019s housing secretary, has described poverty as \u201cmore of a choice \nthan anything else.\u201d This \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d narrative animated some \nreader critics of the Knapps. \u201cThis article describes ruined, pitiful people,\u201d \none reader commented. \u201cThe main problem they have is weakness of character.\u201d \nOver the last half-century, this narrative has gained ground in America; it\u2019s an\n echo of the \u201csocial Darwinism\u201d that circulated a century ago. I\u2019ve come to \nthink that the biggest impediment to strengthening America isn\u2019t a shortage of \nresources but this personal responsibility obsession. When we underinvest in our\n own human capital, when so many Americans are only marginally literate or \nnumerate or suffer from ill health or dependencies, then our entire country \nsuffers. If America wants to compete with China, we should worry less about \nintellectual property protections and more about investing in the well-being of \nyoung Americans. Yet the personal responsibility narrative leads states to \nrefuse to expand Medicaid. It leads us to lock up drug users instead of \nproviding them help, even though each dollar invested in treatment can save $12 \nor more in reduced criminal justice and health costs. When we as a nation are \nwilling to pay extra so that we can lock people up and rip apart their families,\n that\u2019s gratuitous cruelty posturing as policy. Of course personal \nresponsibility matters. But imagine if we took the personal responsibility \nobsession to auto safety. That would look something like this: Auto crashes \noften are a result of speeding, drinking or texting. If we coddle drivers with \nairbags and padded dashboards, and have ambulances ready to rescue them, they\u2019ll\n never learn to drive responsibly. Better to implant spikes in dashboards so \nthey appreciate consequences! A newborn in a ZIP code of North Philadelphia with\n a largely poor and black population has a life expectancy 20 years shorter than\n a newborn in mostly white central Philadelphia just four miles away; that\u2019s not\n because one infant has displayed \u201cweak character.\u201d Britain reduced child \npoverty by half under Tony Blair. It\u2019s not that British infants suddenly showed \nmore personal responsibility; it\u2019s that the government showed responsibility. \nHere in the United States, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and \nMedicine laid out a blueprint for reducing America\u2019s child poverty by half, yet \nCongress and President Trump do nothing. In that sense, Dr. Carson is right: \nPoverty is a choice. But it\u2019s our choice. My friends the Knapps made mistakes. \nOf course they did. But they weren\u2019t less responsible, less talented or less \nhard-working than their parents or grandparents who had thrived in the postwar \nera. What changed was diminishing access to good jobs, reduced commitment to \ninvestment in human capital, a hurricane of addictive drugs (some peddled by the\n pharmaceutical industry), and the rise of a harsh social narrative that \nvilified those left behind \u2014 a narrative that workers often internalized. \nWorkers lost their dignity and hope, and that exacerbated the spiral of self-\nmedication and self-destruction, of loneliness and despair that swept through my\n No. 6 bus. We moved from an inclusive capitalism in the postwar era to a rigged\n system that hobbles unions, underinvests in children and then punishes those \nleft behind. This is the moral equivalent of spikes on dashboards. What would a \nbetter social narrative look like? It would acknowledge personal responsibility \nbut also our collective social responsibility \u2014 especially to help children. It \nwould be infused with empathy and a \u201cmorality of grace\u201d that is less about \npointing fingers and more about offering helping hands. It would accept that a \ncountry cannot reach its potential when so many of its citizens are not \nachieving theirs. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to\n the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Senate Republicans Are Bathed in Shame There\u2019s no \n\u201cimpartial justice,\u201d just protection of Trump at all costs. By Frank Bruni \nOpinion Columnist The impeachment trial of Donald John Trump began on Thursday \nwhen John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, directed all of the \nsenators to stand and raise their right hands. Ever since I can\u2019t get two \nquestions out of my head. The first: How in God\u2019s name \u2014 and it was in God\u2019s \nname \u2014 can the Republicans who have already decided to acquit President Trump \ntake a solemn oath to administer \u201cimpartial justice\u201d? They\u2019re partial to the \ncore, unabashedly so, as their united march toward a foregone conclusion shows. \nA mind-meld this ironclad isn\u2019t a reflection of facts. It\u2019s a triumph of \nfactionalism. The majority of the party\u2019s senators have said outright or clearly\n signaled that they have no intention of finding the president guilty and \nremoving him from office. Yapping lap dogs like Lindsey Graham and obedient \nmanservants like Mitch McConnell have gone further, mocking the whole \nimpeachment process. So the oath they took: How does that work? Did they cross \nthe fingers on their left hands? Do they reason that American politics has \nreached a nadir of such fundamental hypocrisy and overweening partisanship that \nno one regards that pledge as anything but window dressing? Certainly they\u2019re \ntelling themselves that their own political survival, hinging on obsequiousness \nto a president with a talent for retribution, matters more than honor. Over the \nthree years of the Trump presidency, they\u2019ve become expert at that calculation. \nMy second question is really a subset, corollary or anagram of the first: How \ncan Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Martha McSally stand to look at themselves in the \nmirror? I\u2019m singling out these three somewhat randomly, but also because they\u2019ve\n traveled particularly self-mortifying journeys away from self-respect. At a \nnews conference on Thursday afternoon, Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Senate\u2019s\n Democratic minority, said that when the chief justice walked into the chamber \nearlier that day, \u201cI saw members on both sides of the aisle visibly gulp.\u201d \nSchumer attributed that to the palpable \u201cweight of history.\u201d But for many of \nthem, it probably had more to do with their awareness that they were about to \nsell out again, this time in circumstances that would be remembered long into \nthe future. Democrats, too, have made up their minds, and that would be equally \nupsetting but for the mountain of actual evidence on which their judgment rests.\n You can erase all the testimony in the House by Gordon Sondland, David Holmes, \nAlexander Vindman, Fiona Hill and others. You can delete Mick Mulvaney\u2019s \nadmission, at a White House news conference, of a quid pro quo. You can discount\n Lev Parnas\u2019s ongoing aria of atonement. Still you have the transcript (of \nsorts) of Trump\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d phone call with the president of Ukraine, in which \nit\u2019s clear to any sane reader with a semblance of common sense that he\u2019s trying \nto trade American aid for the smearing of Joe Biden. If there were nothing to \nthis, why would Trump stonewall Congress to the extent that he has? That\u2019s not \nhow the innocent act. When witness after witness tells a version of the same \nstory, providing pieces of a puzzle that fit snugly together, you can reach a \nconclusion about the whole of it. That\u2019s called logic. And if the actual case \nagainst Trump were weak, why would Republicans keep redirecting attention to \nDemocrats\u2019 motivations \u2014 to how much they despise the president? That\u2019s called \ndistraction. McSally practiced it on Thursday when, in a moment of breathtaking \nhostility, she answered a reasonable question from Manu Raju of CNN about \nwhether any new evidence should be presented during the Senate trial by \nsnarling, \u201cLiberal hack!\u201d She\u2019s terrified. Her state, Arizona, is increasingly \npurple. She lost her 2018 race for the Senate and ended up in the chamber only \nby appointment following John McCain\u2019s death. She has to run again this year, \nagainst Mark Kelly, the former astronaut, who\u2019s a popular figure. She\u2019s \nvulnerable, and standing with Trump is almost as much of a gamble as standing up\n to him would be. But she once did stand up to him. She used to have guts. \nBefore going into politics, she blazed trails as an Air Force pilot and even \nsued the secretary of defense when she detected discrimination against women. \nDuring her successful campaign for the House in 2016, she pointedly didn\u2019t \nendorse Trump and just as pointedly spoke out against the behavior that he \ncopped to \u2014 no, bragged about \u2014 in that infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. \nMcSally had a moral compass then. Now she just has a hunger to hold onto her \nsuite of offices in the Capitol. She has wagered that emulating Trump is her \nbest bet. At the conclusion of this pathetic excuse for a trial, she\u2019ll vote to \nacquit him \u2014 impartially, of course. She\u2019ll be joined by Cruz and Rubio, who are\n special targets of my disappointment because they were once special targets of \nTrump\u2019s ugliness. They know it firsthand and well. They campaigned against him \nfor the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, when he didn\u2019t just \ncriticize them but viciously belittled and even savaged them. He conspiracy-\ntheorized a role for Cruz\u2019s father in John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination. \u201cA \npathological liar,\u201d Cruz called Trump. But now that Trump is president and his \nbase has become the most impassioned constituency in the party, Cruz is his \nbiggest cheerleader and a ready mouthpiece for all of those lies. He has swapped\n thoughts of 2016 for thoughts of 2024, when there\u2019s another opportunity to \nreach for the White House and Trump\u2019s loyalists will come in handy. He\u2019ll have \nto muscle aside Javanka and Don Jr., but that\u2019s a pickle for another day. First \nstep: acquittal! Rubio has long fashioned himself a foreign-policy maven and \ntook a hard line when it came to Russia. So you might think that the Trump \npresidency would be especially galling to him. You might also think that Trump\u2019s\n bullying of Ukraine \u2014 which left the country more vulnerable to Russian \naggression \u2014 would be some sort of breaking point. But he\u2019s a Republican member \nof Congress in 2020, which means he\u2019s a sycophantic shell of his former self. \nAnd having bitten his tongue about Trump\u2019s global misadventures, he\u2019ll now abet \nmore of the same by helping Trump stay in office. There are so many other \nRepublican senators to marvel at. Mitt Romney, what was the point of diving back\n into public life if you\u2019re going to prop up a president whose fraudulence you \nonce gave a whole long speech about? Lamar Alexander, you venerated Howard \nBaker, a fellow Tennessean who once held your Senate seat and put principle \nabove partisanship by standing up to President Nixon. Why not do the same and \nstand up to President Trump? Susan Collins, I can\u2019t imagine the exhaustion of \nyour role as political wild card, scrutinized to a fare-thee-well. But come on. \nIf you\u2019re going to pride yourself on autonomy, you need to exercise it when it \nmatters most. It\u2019s not fun to be any of you right now, with McConnell above you \nand #MAGA hellions below you poised to make your life a misery if you stray. But\n no one forced you into public service. When you entered the Senate, you took an\n oath, and you took another one on Thursday.

            "full_text": "Opinion War Has Ripple Effects I am a military widow. I know what the true cost \nof conflict is. Credit...Illustration by Nicholas Konrad; photographs by Karie \nFugett Supported by By Karie Fugett Ms. Fugett is a writer and farmer. DRAIN, \nOre. \u2014 The first thing I saw when I walked into the viewing room was my \nhusband\u2019s nose. The familiar curve of it extended above the sides of the coffin \nhis mother and I had chosen only days before. My legs went limp, and I fell to \nthe ground. Justin, a wounded Marine and friend of my husband, knelt and wrapped\n his arms around me as I cried. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Hours \nlater, in exchange for my husband, he handed me an American flag folded like \norigami into a perfect triangle. I buried Cpl. Jimmy Cleveland Kinsey II on \nApril 26, 2010, when I was 24 years old. His body rests in Summerdale, Ala., \nonly minutes from the town where we met when we were 13 and 14 years old. War \nhas ripple effects, and my life has been irrevocably changed because of our \ncontinuing conflicts in the Middle East. Cleve had been wounded in Ramadi, Iraq,\n nearly four years earlier on April 1, 2006, nine days before the three-month \nmark of our marriage. At first, he survived. He had been driving a Humvee when \nit was hit by a roadside bomb. His door was blown clean off, the massive vehicle\n thrown onto its side. His leg was shattered. He was flown to the States \nimmediately. I drove through the night from Camp Lejeune, N.C., to Bethesda \nNaval Hospital in Maryland to be with him. I\u2019d never seen Cleve so frail. His \nleg was being held together with what looked like plastic wrap and his body was \ncovered in tubes and wires. He reached his arms toward me. \u201cThere she is,\u201d he \nsaid, and we kissed. That week, a doctor called me a \u201ccaregiver\u201d for the first \ntime. This word would become my identity. The doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital\n did the best they could to salvage his leg. After a year and a half of \ncountless surgeries, a bone infection set in. His lower left leg had to be \namputated. He was devastated. Cleve was in so much pain. He described his pain \nas always being there, something he wasn\u2019t sure would ever go away. Pain became \na part of who he was. \u201cI can\u2019t keep living like this,\u201d he told me once as he \nheld the nub of his left leg. To help him, doctors prescribed opioids. It didn\u2019t\n take long for Cleve to become addicted to them. I first noticed something was \nwrong when he would fall asleep sitting up while smoking a cigarette, the ashes \ngrowing so long they\u2019d ash themselves. Once, he fell asleep with his face down \nin a bowl of Cheerios. In 2008, he overdosed for the first time. I woke up to \ngrunting noises. When I turned the light on, I found him in bed next to me, \nsuffocating on his own vomit. His skin was purple and his eyes were rolled into \nthe back of his head. I called 911 and performed C.P.R. Cleve survived again. \nThree weeks later, I miscarried. I have always wondered whether I lost the baby \nbecause of the stress I experienced from the overdose. Doctors at the military \nhospitals where Cleve was treated weren\u2019t equipped to treat his addiction. The \nterm \u201copioid crisis\u201d hadn\u2019t been coined yet. After Cleve\u2019s first overdose, the \ndoctors had few options available. They could either take his pain medications \naway entirely, which would mean torturing him with pain, or they could switch up\n the kind of opioid he was taking. They chose the latter. On April 20, 2010, my \nhusband died in Houston of an accidental overdose at an inpatient facility, \nProject Victory, where he was receiving treatment for PTSD. (Project Victory has\n since closed its doors.) I know the impact of war firsthand. War left me a \nwidow. Just as the pain had become a part of my husband, grief has become a part\n of me. In this, I am not alone. Since we first went to war in Afghanistan in \n2001, 7,013 service members have been killed and 53,088 have been wounded in \nconflicts in the Middle East and Afghanistan. The cost of war is every citizen\u2019s\n burden to carry, not just the burden of those willing to fight. If you choose \nto support a war, be prepared to support those who are most affected by it. War \nhas effects that extend beyond the casualties. Widows will be left to take care \nof their children alone. Children will be left without parents. Caregivers will \nbe forced to put their lives on hold, as I did, to tend to the wounds of their \nspouses. Parents will bury their children. Veterans will be left with brain \ninjuries, trauma and amputations \u2014 or, like my husband, with an opioid \naddiction. My husband was more than just a Marine. He was a big brother, a son \nand a loyal friend. In high school, just before he joined the Marines, he was a \nfootball player. His favorite subject was history and he wanted more than \nanything to be a crop duster pilot \u2014 to swoop and dive through the Alabama skies\n he grew up under. In Alabama, he grew up poor and with very few options \navailable. The Marine Corps offered him free health care, decent pay, housing \nand a free education. Serving during wartime was worth it to him if it meant a \nchance to make something of himself. At 19 years old, Cleve signed his life \naway, even if he didn\u2019t know it at the time. The morning after the funeral, I \ncried alone in my bed wearing one of my husband\u2019s favorite shirts, a green one \nthat said \u201cJesus Loves This Guy\u201d and had two thumbs pointing up at my face. My \nwhole life was ahead of me but I wasn\u2019t sure how I could bear living it after \nlosing the man I loved. This April, it will have been 10 years since Cleve died.\n I keep a box of his belongings \u2014 uniforms, pictures, medals \u2014 in a spare room \nin the house I am rebuilding by hand with the insurance money I received after \nhis death. When I notice the box collecting dust, I open it again and touch the \nthings that were once so dear to him. This is my way of remembering him, of \nremembering the kids we once were: so young and in love and unaware that one day\n we would sacrifice everything.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Capt. \u2018Sully\u2019 Sullenberger: Like Joe Biden, I Once \nStuttered, Too. I Dare You to Mock Me. The retired pilot responds to recent \ncomments from the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, on the way the former\n vice president talks. By Chesley B. Sullenberger III Mr. Sullenberger is a \nretired pilot, safety expert and public speaker. As a small boy in Denison, \nTexas, I remember vividly the anguish of being called on in grade school, \nknowing that I was going to have a hard time getting the words out; that my \nwords could not keep up with my mind, and they would often come out jumbled. My \nneck and face would quickly begin to flush a bright red, the searing heat rising\n all the way to the top of my head; every eye in the room on me; the intense and\n painful humiliation, and bullying that would follow, all because of my \ninability to get the words out. Those feelings came rushing back, when I heard \nLara Trump mocking former Vice President Joe Biden at a Trump campaign event, \nwith the very words that caused my childhood agony. \u201cJoe, can you get it out?\u201d \nMs. Trump was seen saying onstage, as a few giggles are heard from an otherwise \nsilent audience. \u201cLet\u2019s get the words out, Joe.\u201d In the interest of full \ndisclosure, I attended a fundraiser last year for the Biden campaign, but this \nissue goes beyond politics. Regardless of how you feel about Joe Biden, or his \nchances of becoming the Democratic nominee for president; whether you are a \nRepublican, a Democrat, or none of the above; whether you stuttered as a child \nor laughed at one who did; whether as a parent you try to protect your own \nstuttering child from taunts such as those made by the president\u2019s daughter-in-\nlaw; these words come without hesitation: Stop. Grow up. Show some decency. \nPeople who can\u2019t, have no place in public life. What might a child who stutters,\n as I did, feel when they hear a grown-up on a public stage trying to make a \nbunch of other adults laugh by ridiculing a public figure who also stutters? \nThis culture of cruelty is what drives decent people from public service, and \nwhat makes millions of Americans recoil from politics, and even from \nparticipating in our democracy. Vice President Biden has spoken openly \u2014 and \ncourageously, in my view \u2014 about the pain of his severe childhood stutter. He \ntakes time to reach out to children who have suffered as he did. As I grew \nolder, I learned to manage and overcome my stuttering, through much hard work \nand intense focus. I learned to slow down and to enunciate each word with \nprecision. I joined the church choir, and found that singing helped me to \npractice controlling my breath, and the formation of words. I learned to resist \nand overcome the bullying. I also learned that our imperfections do not define \nus. The fact that I once stuttered did not keep me from being a successful U.S. \nAir Force fighter pilot, an airline pilot, or even a public speaker. And on that\n frigid day in January 2009, when I had to tell the air traffic controller at \nNew York Departure Control that I was about to land US Airways Flight 1549 in \nthe Hudson River, after a bird strike following takeoff caused both engines to \nfail, my words came out with precision and control, even in the stress of a \nlife-threatening emergency. So, to every child who feels today, what I felt, \nafter hearing those cruel remarks by an adult who should know better, here is \nwhat I want you to know: You are fine, just as you are. You can do any job you \ndream of when you grow up. You can be a pilot who lands your plane on a river \nand helps save lives, or a president who treats people with respect, rather than\n making fun of them. You can become a teacher to kids who stutter. A speech \ndisorder is a lot easier to treat than a character defect. You become a true \nleader, not because of how you speak, but because of what you have to say \u2014 and \nthe challenges you have overcome to help others. Ignore kids (and adults) who \nare mean, or don\u2019t know what it feels like to stutter. Respond by showing them \nhow to be kind, polite, respectful and generous, to be brave enough to try big \nthings, even though you are not perfect. Do that, and the sky is the limit.
