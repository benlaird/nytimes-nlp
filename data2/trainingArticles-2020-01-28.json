            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Weaponizing Truth Against Opioids A decades-old \ncampaign that knew how to talk to teenagers persuaded millions of them to never \nstart smoking. Can it now persuade them never to misuse opioids? By Tina \nRosenberg Ms. Rosenberg is a co-founder of the Solutions Journalism Network, \nwhich supports rigorous reporting about responses to social problems. This ad \ndepicts a true story. It begins: A young man walks around his car, which is up \non a jack. He says in voice-over: \u201cI got some Oxy after I hurt my neck. First I \ntook them to feel better. Then I kept taking them. I didn\u2019t know they\u2019d be this \naddictive. I didn\u2019t know how far I\u2019d go to get more.\u201d Here\u2019s how far he\u2019d go: He\n lies down under the car. Then he kicks out the jack. You see the car fall, hear\n a crunch. \u201cJoe S. from Maine broke his back to get more prescription opioids,\u201d \nthe screen says. And then a voice-over: \u201cOpioid dependence can happen after just\n five days. Know the truth, spread the truth.\u201d A similar ad shows a woman taking\n off her seatbelt and deliberately crashing her car. In another, a man breaks \nhis hand with a hammer. In another, a man slams his arm in a door. Together, \nthose comprised the first national ad campaign in America aimed at preventing \nopioid misuse. They came from the Truth Initiative, the organization that was \nbehind truth ads that helped bring about one of the most important public health\n victories in American history: In 1996, 34 percent of high school seniors had \nsmoked a cigarette in the previous month \u2014 the same as in 1975. But by 2019, \nless than 6 percent smoked. Now truth ads are being focusing on opioid abuse. \nThere\u2019s a relationship: More than 70 percent of opioid users also smoke, and \nthere is evidence that smoking can prime the brain for other addictions. Can the\n strategy work again? Let\u2019s look at what the group did right in its antismoking \ncampaign. Before the truth ads, antismoking ads for teenagers were created by \npublic health experts who, not surprisingly, emphasized that cigarettes can kill\n you. That threat works well to encourage adults to quit smoking. But it doesn\u2019t\n prevent teens from starting. For many adolescents, the danger is a lure; they \nsmoke to rebel against preachy adults. To them, the consequences are decades \naway, and teens are immortal. In the 1990s, Florida and California hired \nadvertising agencies that didn\u2019t know about public health, but did know about \nselling to teens. They created ads to redirect teenage rebellion against the \nmanipulations of the tobacco industry. Some examples: One California \nadvertisement portrayed tobacco executives in a smoke-filled room, cackling \nmaniacally as they plot to replace 1,100 customers who quit smoking every day \u2014 \n\u201cActually, technically, they die,\u201d one says. Another ad showed rappers attacking\n Big Tobacco for targeting African-Americans with menthol cigarettes. It ended, \n\u201cWe used to pick it; now they want us to smoke it.\u201d In Florida, teenagers \ncreated ads for a campaign they named \u201ctruth.\u201d One showed girls making prank \nphone calls to tobacco ad executives. \u201cWhat is the lucky part about Lucky Strike\n cigarettes?\u201d a girl asks. \u201cIt is because\" (pause) I might live?\u201d That was in \n1998. Over the next two years, teen smoking in Florida fell by 17.5 percent. \nFlorida was one of the first states to sue tobacco companies. When a nationwide \nsettlement was reached, part of the money created a national truth campaign. It \ncopied Florida\u2019s strategies and hired its people. And it enjoyed the same \nsuccess. Of course, truth ads were only one part of this victory. States and \ncities raised their cigarette taxes. Indoor smoking vanished. But the ads were \ncrucial. (This success is now threatened by an explosion in vaping \u2014 also known \nas \u201cjuuling,\u201d after the biggest brand, Juul, whose use among teenagers and young\n adults doubled from 2018 to 2019. Young people who vape are four times more \nlikely to try cigarettes than those who don\u2019t. Counting vaping, teen tobacco use\n now is the highest it has been in decades.) Those truth ads still target \nadolescent smoking. New teenagers are minted every year, so the campaign never \nends. It also makes \u201cDitch Juul\u201d ads that show teens creatively demolishing \ntheir vaping equipment. All this is useful for anti-opioid campaigns. \u201cThere\u2019s a\n lot of crossover in terms of strategy for reaching your target audience of \nyouth,\u201d said Matthew Farrelly, senior director of the Center for Health Policy \nScience and Tobacco Research at RTI International in North Carolina. \u201cThe \nvariety of tactics for getting in front of teens is nearly identical.\u201d Surveys \nabout the truth ads show that 80 percent of teenagers recognize the brand. And \nthe organization knows what works. A review of published studies in 2014 \nconcluded, \u201cYouth are more likely to recall and think about advertising that \nincludes personal testimonials; a surprising narrative; and intense images, \nsound and editing.\u201d That\u2019s Joe S. from Maine, all right. Anti-opioid ads can use\n the antismoking template, but the message must be different. \u201cNobody needs \neducation on the fact that tobacco is really bad for you,\u201d said Robin Koval, \npresident and chief executive of the Truth Initiative. \u201cWith opioids, we found \nout how little people know.\u201d Adolescents know about the misery of addiction \u2014 \nand addiction and overdose at 20 are scary in a way lung cancer at 60 is not. \n\u201cBut there is a lack of understanding and awareness of how easily you can become\n addicted,\u201d Ms. Koval said. Some adolescents start using opioids because their \nfriends share. For others, the beginning is pain medication. Getting a \nprescription in high school after knee surgery or wisdom teeth removal is \nassociated with a 33 percent higher chance of misusing opioids later in life. A \nstudy published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded, \n\u201cThe probability of long-term opioid use increases sharply in the first days of \ntherapy\u201d \u2014 with a spike after five days. So every truth ad ends with: \u201cOpioid \ndependence can happen after just five days.\u201d \u201cThe hardest thing to go up against\n is nobody believes they\u2019re going to become addicted to opioids,\u201d Ms. Koval \nsaid. \u201cWe had to reverse this notion of otherness. And we have to combat the \nstigma that says: This is a moral failing and therefore I can\u2019t believe it would\n happen to me or anybody we know.\u201d The Joe S. ad is part of a campaign that \nbegan in July 2018, in collaboration with the White House Office of National \nDrug Control Policy and the Ad Council. Facebook, Google, Turner, Amazon and \nVice donated advertising time or space. (The Google News Initiative is a funder \nof the Solutions Journalism Network, my employer.) Last year, a truth video \ntitled \u201cTreatment Box: Rebekkah\u2019s Story,\u201d won an Emmy. In it, Rebekkah, then 26,\n started using opioids at 14 after a cheerleading injury. The ad showed her \ndetoxing \u2014 minute by minute. The video was projected into a clear glass bedroom-\nsize box in Times Square. Passers-by watched Rebekkah\u2019s pain. A new ad series, \n\u201cBest Day,\" has a relatable \u201cit could be you\u201d message, said Margie Skeer, \nassociate professor at Tufts University School of Medicine. It\u2019s graduation day,\n or signing day for college sports, or a basketball awards assembly \u2014 but the \nhappy teens explain that on this, their best day, they see their futures as \nbleak: that the pain of adult stress or a sports injury will lead them to \nopioids, then addiction, and finally to overdosing. \u201cMy mom will bury me with my\n cleats,\u201d one girl says. It\u2019s too soon to know if these ads reduce youth opioid \nmisuse. A test of the Joe S.-style ads found that people who saw them were \nsignificantly more likely to agree that someone like them could become dependent\n on prescription opioids. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe not quite as elaborate and creative and \nmultifaceted as the truth campaign,\u201d said Dr. Farrelly. \u201cBut if their goal is to\n raise awareness of risk, it might not be a bad strategy.\u201d But that\u2019s not the \nsame as avoiding addiction. The gripping Joe S. ads produce horror and fear. \n\u201cFear works in the moment,\u201d Dr. Skeer said. \u201cBut when people are scared but \ndon\u2019t know what to do next, it can become paralyzing.\u201d Other public health \nresearchers also said that the ads needed to answer the question: \u201cO.K., so what\n should I do?\u201d The truth campaign responded that opioids were complicated, and \nthat covering various scenarios in the ad would have been confusing. Instead, it\n seeks to drive young people to the Truth Initiative website, where they can get\n advice. The first ads should have a clear focus on \u201ctelling stories that felt \nauthentic and true in the voices of young people,\u201d Ms. Koval said. \u201cHelping them\n to understand this can happen to you.\u201d Tina Rosenberg won a Pulitzer Prize for \nher book \u201cThe Haunted Land: Facing Europe\u2019s Ghosts After Communism.\u201d She is a \nformer editorial writer for The Times, a vice president of the Solutions \nJournalism Network, and the author, most recently, of \u201cJoin the Club: How Peer \nPressure Can Transform the World\u201d and the World War II spy story e-book \u201cD for \nDeception.\u201d To receive email alerts for Fixes columns, sign up here.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The conversation Always Look on the Bright Side of \nImpeachment Not to mention the Democratic presidential race. It can be done, if \nyou put your mind to it. By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. \nStephens are opinion columnists. In 2020, they will converse every week. Gail \nCollins: Bret, there are only two subjects in our current political world: \nimpeachment and the Democratic presidential race. Both are certainly \u2026 exciting.\n I know you\u2019re as eager to see Donald Trump kicked out of the White House as I \nam, but despite all the heavy drama on the impeachment front, it isn\u2019t going to \nhappen. Any words of comfort? Bret Stephens: Hi, Gail. Well, if a global \nperspective helps make our domestic predicament seem less gloomy, tens of \nmillions of people are under quarantine in China as the country struggles to \ncome to grips with a deadly virus. In the immortal words of Eric Idle, \u201calways \nlook on the bright side of life.\u201d Gail: \u201cIf life seems jolly rotten, there\u2019s \nsomething you\u2019ve forgotten \u2026\u201d Oh yeah, the economy. Getting sort of tired of \ntrying to take comfort from the stock market. Bret: As for the Senate trial, \nit\u2019s a bit like watching a recording of a football game when you already know \nthe final score, at least within a point or two. Is it going to be 46-54 on the \nfirst count, and 47-53 on the second? Or the other way around? The only suspense\n here is whether the eye-popping disclosures in John Bolton\u2019s memoir \u2014 the ones \ntelling us, for the umpteenth time, that Trump is lying through his teeth about \nhis shakedown of Ukraine \u2014 will sway any of the Republican senators. Gail: I \nhave to admit the Bolton revelation \u2014 which, as you point out, is a big moment \nbut not exactly a big surprise \u2014 perked me up. But one of the many downsides of \nthe Senate trial is the amount of time people are having to spend contemplating \nthe heart and mind of Susan Collins. Bret: Or Lamar Alexander and Mitt Romney. \nAbout the most we can hope for is that Bolton will somehow get a chance to \ntestify, and that a majority of Americans might be swayed that Trump should be \nremoved from office, no matter how the Senate votes. But the polls seem pretty \nevenly divided and haven\u2019t yet factored in his defense. I fear the likeliest \noutcome is that Trump emerges from the trial stronger politically and, if it\u2019s \npossible, even more shameless. Gail: Hey, what happened to the bright side of \nlife? Not sure the impact is going to be all that great for Trump politically \u2014 \nhe needs more than the base to get re-elected. And even he knows, deep down in \nhis little bitty heart, that he\u2019s going to go down in history as a terrible \npresident. Let\u2019s move over to the Democrats. I have to congratulate you for \ntaking Bernie Sanders seriously before I did. It\u2019s really beginning to look as \nif he could win the nomination. Bret: According to the RealClearPolitics average\n for the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden remains strongly competitive, and a recent \npoll by USA Today/Suffolk even has him comfortably in the lead there. And \nparticularly in a caucus, you never really know. Gail: Yeah, we\u2019ll be on the \nedge of our seats next week, waiting to hear what the four Klobuchar people in \nthe gym decide to do when she falls off the edge. It seems appropriate that a \npolitical process ending with a vote by the Electoral College begins with the \nIowa caucuses. Just to be sure nobody ever gets the impression this is just \nabout the will of the people. Bret: The Times/Siena poll has Sanders up by a \nwhopping 7 percentage points. And Sanders\u2019s lead in New Hampshire is even more \nsolid, meaning he\u2019ll be entering the rest of the primary and caucus season with \nsome Big Mo. Gail: Wow, Trump vs. Sanders. This is when I am forced to inter \nforever my theory that women won\u2019t vote for guys who yell because they remind \nthem of their worst boyfriends. We could actually be cruising toward the Battle \nof the Bad Dates. Bret: That could be its own reality TV show, Gail, if it isn\u2019t\n already. The more important advantage for Sanders is that there\u2019s no doubting \nwhere he stands. I\u2019m obviously no fan of what he stands for, but he has ideas \nand convictions that are unequivocal, authentic, easy to understand and based on\n a powerful moral sensibility. That\u2019s the essence of good politics. None of the \nother Democrats have quite that combination. Biden\u2019s political flaw is that, \nlike John McCain in 2008, he\u2019s running on experience and character, not ideas \nand policies. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s flaw is that she\u2019s Pepsi to Sanders\u2019s Coke \u2014 \nthe same stuff, more or less, but not quite as authentic. Gail: I\u2019ve got to \ndefend Warren. She\u2019s the one who actually tries to envision working out her big \nideas in the real world. Most of the nation first saw her fighting for the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, and she was really drawn into politics to \npromote her proposals. Bret: That\u2019s true. And it\u2019s noteworthy that she\u2019s taken a\n great deal more flak than Sanders merely for putting out more detailed \nproposals of ideas they both share. Maybe it\u2019s on account of an underlying \nsexism. Or maybe it\u2019s because she was simply taken far more seriously as a \npolitically viable candidate than Sanders was up until about a month ago. As for\n the other candidates, I fear they are fading in the rearview mirror. Am I wrong\n about that? Gail: Not sure but it\u2019s weird how much time people are spending \ndebating vice-presidential favorites. Would Biden pick Kamala Harris or Amy \nKlobuchar? Bret: Klobuchar, please. Biden needs to win voters in the Midwest, \nnot in California. And Harris proved to be an inept candidate. Gail: Any chance \nfor Cory Booker? Bret: Could be, but he also caught about as much fire in this \nrace as a wet log. If I were Biden and I wanted to have an African-American \nrunning mate who conveys a sense of seriousness and reliability \u2014 the things you\n look for in a veep \u2014 a smart choice would be Eric Holder. Or, even better, \nCharles Bolden, the former Marine general and NASA astronaut and administrator. \nGail: This is no small matter when your two leading presidential contenders are \nin their late 70s, one recently recovered from a heart attack. Bret: I keep \nhearing that 80 is the new 60! Good news for us all. Gail: Mike Bloomberg has \nfound his real role. Once he gives up campaigning for himself, he\u2019s clearly \ngoing to shift his financial support to whoever the Democratic nominee turns out\n to be. And even Mike knows it ain\u2019t gonna be him. You\u2019re a big fan of Mayor \nPete, but this is a guy who\u2019s getting his game ready for 2024 or 2028 or \u2014 hell,\n he could even be a player in 2060. Bret: Right about when he\u2019ll be as old as \nBernie is today! And I\u2019m sure the former mayor will be running even then. Gail: \nWe\u2019ve still got a way to go before the ticket is set, though. Iowa! New \nHampshire! South Carolina! God, I have so many memories \u2014 like John McCain after\n winning New Hampshire in 2000, standing next to the airplane that was going to \nfly him to South Carolina, looking as if somebody had hit him over the head with\n a skillet. I think he was more stunned than anyone. That New Hampshire primary,\n with McCain just driving around the state, giving town halls about campaign \nfinance reform and talking with reporters on the bus between stops, was the best\n political event I ever covered. How about you? Any primary blasts from the \npast? Bret: My background was almost entirely on the foreign policy end, so I \nnever covered primary races the way you did. But I\u2019d always meet with the \ncandidates \u2014 Republicans, mostly \u2014 whenever they trooped into our offices at The\n Wall Street Journal. The most memorable meeting was, of course, with Donald \nTrump, who couldn\u2019t seem to answer a single question in a remotely coherent or \nnon-narcissistic fashion. We walked out bemused and appalled and convinced he \nwould eventually fade, which, well, tells you how much pundits really know about\n politics. Gail: Yeah, when Trump came to The Times for his first meet-the-\npresidential-candidate event, he walked up to me and said: \u201cYou have never been \nnice to me!\u201d or something to that effect. We go back a ways. And then he went on\n to answer questions, all of which made it clear that his position on virtually \nevery issue was based on when he got the most applause at campaign stops. I \nguarantee you that\u2019s the story on abortion and gun rights. Bret: And nearly \nevery other subject. I think it\u2019s why he loves his rallies. He\u2019s picking up cues\n from them as much as they are from him. Gail: My very first presidential \ncampaign assignment was long, long ago at the New York Daily News \u2014 in 1987, \nwhen Gary Hart was a Democratic favorite until a sex scandal arose. You may have\n heard about the picture of him and Donna Rice on a boat called \u201cMonkey \nBusiness.\u201d Anyhow, he dropped out, then tried to get back in. His poor wife Lee \nwas with him, attempting to look supportive as they dragged around New Hampshire\n searching for some voters to talk to. They had no money or staff, let alone a \npress bus. Didn\u2019t give me much insight into the campaign \u2014 Mike Dukakis won the \nnomination, God help us. But it did get me started working on a book about \npolitical sex scandals. Bret: I remember that campaign pretty well, though I was\n barely a teenager when it all went down. It now seems sort of quaint in this \nage of Who-cares-if-the-president-of-the-United-States-had-an-affair-with-a-\nporn-star-shortly-after-his-third-wife-gave-birth-to-their-son-and-that-he-\nlater-paid-said-porn-star-more-than-one-hundred-grand-in-hush-money-in-naked-\nviolation-of-campaign-finance-laws-right-before-his-election-for-which-he-was-\nnamed-an-unindicted-co-conspirator-by-the-Southern-District-of-New-York-while-\nhis-fixer-landed-in-prison. My question is, are we better today for being so \nmuch less judgmental about these things, or not? Gail: Well first \u2014 kudos on \nyour hyphenation extravaganza. Bret: Just stop me when I revert to ALL CAPS. \nGail: And about the scandals \u2014 voters could always hear rumors about \npoliticians\u2019 sexual indiscretions. You just had to walk into the right tavern \naround 1800 and you\u2019d hear salacious songs about Thomas Jefferson\u2019s affair with \n\u201cDusky Sally\u201d \u2014 his slave at Monticello, Sally Hemings. Bret: Or his archrival \nAlexander Hamilton, for that matter. Gail: Americans always focus on the bad-\ncharacter stories about politicians they were prepared to dislike anyhow. And \nthey ignore the others unless it\u2019s forced on them \u2014 like Bill Clinton being \nimpeached for lying about his sex life. I have lots of friends who will rant \nabout Trump\u2019s extramarital affairs and grabby little hands. But they\u2019d happily \noverlook infidelity in their favorite Democratic candidates. Except, now that I \nthink of it, we don\u2019t have a whole lot of sex gossip on the Democratic side this\n time around. Do you think it\u2019s because so many of them are so old? Bret: Maybe \nit\u2019s to do with rising awareness around #MeToo issues. I suspect that any \ncandidate who knew he \u2014 it\u2019s almost always \u201che\u201d \u2014 had a #MeToo issue also knew \nbetter than to run. But it also speaks to the great switcheroo in American \npolitics, which is that it is now the Democratic Party that cares about issues \nof moral character and sexual propriety, and the Republican Party that, well, \ndoesn\u2019t. Gail: It is pretty amazing how the evangelicals have managed to ignore \nall the Trump morality messes. Unless you accept my theory that American voters \nare incredibly practical and don\u2019t care if politicians follow the right values \nin private as long as they pass the right laws in public. But I like your \nswitcheroo analysis. Bret: It holds for other things as well. Democrats were \naghast when Trump decided to pull troops out of Syria. They are much tougher on \nRussia than many in the G.O.P. And they\u2019re standing firm for the originalist \nview of the Constitution, certainly when it comes to impeachable offenses. Gail,\n all Democrats need to do is come around on tax cuts, deregulation and a strong \ndefense and we\u2019ll never disagree again.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Many Polarizations of America Three new books \ncover the different ways and reasons that we\u2019ve ended up divided. By Ross \nDouthat Opinion Columnist This month has brought a surfeit of interesting new \nbooks about American politics, most of them attempts to explain exactly how we \nreached our current era of gridlock and demagogy, in which disliked \nestablishments and disreputable populists clash by night. This task means that \nthey are necessarily studies in polarization, in the roots of partisan hatred \nand ideological mistrust. And it means they usefully be read together, and \nagainst one another, to try to get a holistic sense of the forces tearing us \napart. I\u2019m going to do that with three of them in this column, starting with the\n one that formally takes polarization as its theme, Ezra Klein\u2019s \u201cWhy We\u2019re \nPolarized.\u201d Klein\u2019s book is political and sociological, but its primary interest\n is psychological: how the tribal impulse shapes our interaction with news and \ninformation, how the partisan brain protects itself from unwanted data and \nuncomfortable truths, how \u201cthe press secretary in your mind\u201d finds a way to spin\n discomfiting developments so that your side comes out on top. This means the \nbook is at its best when Klein is puncturing the kind of simplistic centrism \nthat imagines that the cure for division is just to educate people about the \nRight Answers\u2122 to complicated policy disputes. In fact education can increase \npolarization, because the more tools you have to interpret the world, the easier\n it is to cleverly interpret it so that your side is always right. Thus high-\ninformation voters are more intense partisans than low-information voters, and \nthe old quip that \u201cX is so foolish, only an intellectual could believe it\u201d has \nempirical support \u2014 in a study Klein cites, for instance, that found smart \npeople talking themselves into the wrong answers on brainteasers where the right\n answers had ideological implications they disliked. The focus on the \npsychological, though, makes Klein\u2019s book a bit less compelling as a historical \naccount of how we ended up polarized in this particular way. Generally the story\n he tells makes today\u2019s partisan polarization seem somewhat inevitable, and its \nrelative absence before the 1970s simply an artifact of the distorting effects \nof Southern segregation on American politics. Once Jim Crow was dismantled, in \nthis telling, some kind of partisan and ideological sort became inevitable. And \nto the extent that Klein offers a specific explanation for why this sorting has \nbecome so much starker and nastier lately, it\u2019s an extension of that story. If \nexcluding black voters from politics entirely once made it easier for white \nAmericans to cooperate across party lines, now growing racial diversity makes \nconservative whites feel under \u201cdemographic threat,\u201d which encourages the bunker\n mentality to which all human beings are prone. Because Klein is a liberal and \nI\u2019m a conservative, it may just be the press secretary in my mind (or my bunker)\n that makes me doubt the completeness of this analysis. But let\u2019s consider a \nrival account offered from the right, in Christopher Caldwell\u2019s \u201cAge of \nEntitlement: America Since the Sixties,\u201d which depicts the polarization that \nKlein analyzes in terms of identity and psychology as more of a war of genuinely\n irreconcilable ideas. Like Klein, Caldwell (a Times contributing Opinion \nwriter) considers the civil rights era a watershed, but in his narrative the \ncrucial polarization isn\u2019t racial but constitutional: In order to rectify racial\n injustice, \u201960s reformers created, through the Civil Rights Act, a structure of\n judicial and bureaucratic supervision and redress that gradually expanded into \na rival constitutional system. This \u201cSecond Constitution\u201d is organized around \nthe advancement of groups claiming equality, not the protection of citizens \nenjoying liberties. And so the claims these groups make must be privileged over \nand against both the normal legislative process and the freedoms of speech and \nreligion and association that the original Constitution protects. Every \nsubsequent culture-war battle, in Caldwell\u2019s account \u2014 the debates over feminism\n and gay marriage, transgender rights and immigration \u2014 follows the lines of \nthis constitutional division. The new constitutionalists are constantly \ndiscovering new rights and empowering courts and bureaucracies to enforce them; \nthe old constitutionalists object, win a few elections on the objection and then\n find themselves defeated nonetheless. And this pattern of defeat is \nresponsible, he implies, for the Trumpian turn: After so many failures to defend\n the old Constitution, Trump-era conservatives are embracing the logic of the \nnew one, choosing white-identity politics because in \u201cthe new constitutional \ndispensation that began in 1964,\u201d group identities are the only ones that count.\n Caldwell\u2019s book is noteworthy for being a conservative account that effectively\n reinforces a liberal ideological narrative. It is usually liberals who argue \nthat on every new culture-war battlefield their side is just extending Martin \nLuther King Jr.\u2019s vision, while conservatives respond that the civil rights acts\n were supposed to correct a specific historical injustice and their application \nto debates over gender or marriage or abortion or the rights of illegal \nimmigrants warps that purpose. Caldwell shrugs off this idea as a pleasant \nillusion; in his account the original critics of civil rights legislation were \nprobably correct to warn against its revolutionary implications, which include \nthe steady subsequent advance of cultural progressivism, an enormous expansion \nof deficit spending and the economic abandonment and cultural vilification of \nthe white male working class. And this is where Caldwell\u2019s account becomes \nunpersuasive in its turn. He depicts federal economic policymaking after the \ncivil rights era as a hugely expensive attempt at \u201cintegrating Americans by race\n and sex,\u201d a project paid for after Ronald Reagan by deficits rather than \ntransfers. But as Wesley Yang points out in a review of \u201cThe Age of Entitlement\u201d\n for The Washington Examiner, there\u2019s little evidence that American public \npolicy actually transfers lots of money from whites to minorities; the spending \nthat Reagan\u2019s deficits funded was for the military and old-age entitlements, \nboth of which flowed far more into white pocketbooks than black ones. Nor were \nthe economic policies that have arguably harmed working class whites the most \nsomehow a necessary extension of civil rights legislation: China\u2019s entry into \nthe World Trade Organization, to choose one signal example, was not somehow \nforeordained when L.B.J. set pen to paper. [Listen to \u201cThe Argument\u201d podcast \nevery Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David \nLeonhardt.] So if Caldwell\u2019s book supplements and corrects Klein\u2019s, by giving a \nclearer sense of the ideological stakes involved in post-1960s polarization, his\n account needs to be corrected and supplemented in its turn. And a third new \nbook, Michael Lind\u2019s \u201cThe New Class War: Saving Democracy From the Managerial \nElite,\u201d does an important part of that work, by explaining an aspect of our \npresent polarization that can\u2019t be traced to specifically American racial fears \nor constitutional debates: Namely, the way that our populist-era divisions \nincreasingly mirror Europe\u2019s, with the same exodus of downscale voters from \nleft-of-center parties, the same polarization by education and class. In Lind\u2019s \naccount, Caldwell\u2019s story about the advance of social liberalism through \nbureaucratic and judicial power is just a subsidiary of the more important \nstory, the post-1970s consolidation of economic power by a \u201cmanagerial\u201d upper \nclass. The liberalism of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama isn\u2019t an ideology of \nwhite disempowerment, in his account, so much as a solvent that weakens any \ninstitution \u2014 from churches and families to union shops and local industries \u2014 \nthat might grant real power to groups outside the gilded city, the Silicon \nValley bubble, the Ivy League gate. And together with its center-right partner \nin crime, Reagan-Thatcher libertarianism, this liberalism\u2019s policy choices \u2014 \neconomic and social permissiveness, effectively conjoined \u2014 created a new class \ndivide, between thriving meritocratic hubs and a declining and demoralized \nheartland, that explains both the frequency of populist irruptions and their \nconsistent futility. But even as he acknowledges the faults of populism, Lind \ntreats the class-war aspect of polarization as a potentially positive \ndevelopment, because he hopes that it will create a real political coalition for\n the losers of neoliberal era \u2014 a socially conservative, economically left-\nleaning constituency that\u2019s numerous but often homeless. Making such a coalition\n constructive rather than just disruptive may be impossible, but it\u2019s the only \nway he sees to escape neoliberal oligarchy and bring our class war to an end \nwith a negotiated peace. Lind is somewhat too polemical in his treatment of \nneoliberalism, too dismissive of the reasons for Reagan-to-Obama economic \nchoices and the constraints that post-1970s policymakers faced, just as Caldwell\n is too polemical in his treatment of racial liberalism and Klein is too \npolemical in his treatment of conservatism. But the beauty of reading several \ntoo-polemical accounts together is that you end up with a capacious-feeling \nportrait of the whole. From Klein you can take the truth that politics tends \nnaturally to polarize and that racial divisions and racism make that \npolarization worse; from Caldwell the truth that our polarization follows \nideological fault lines, not just tribal ones; from Lind the reality that \nculture war looks indistinguishable from class war the deeper our polarization \ngets. Still, there is one book missing to complete the picture: All of these \nwriters treat the dramatic religious trends since the 1960s, both secularization\n and institutional-Christian decline, as subsidiary to their major themes, and \nin fact the religious polarization of America is at least as important to the \nstory as the polarizations they describe. But a description of how religious \npolarization interacts with all the other forms, like the question of how one \nmight transcend any of them, will have to await another column, and a different \nset of reading recommendations. For now, read these three books together, and \nyou will be closer to enlightenment \u2014 though maybe also a little more despairing\n \u2014 about our widening divisions than you are right now.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Should You Be Worried About the Coronavirus? Public \nhealth experts explain the risks and what we still don\u2019t know. By Spencer Bokat-\nLindell Mr. Bokat-Lindell is a writer in The New York Times Opinion section. \nThis article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to \nreceive it Tuesdays and Thursdays. For the third time this century, a new strain\n of coronavirus, a family of pathogens that cause respiratory illness in birds \nand mammals, has jumped species and infected humans. Having broken out in the \ncity of Wuhan, the virus, likely spread through coughing and sneezing, has now \nsickened more than 4,500 people and killed at least 106 in China.  On Monday, \nThe New York Times reported that five people in the United States had tested \npositive for the illness. But how worried should you really be? Here\u2019s what \npublic health experts and others are saying. \u2018A cause for caution \u2014 not for \nalarm\u2019 The outbreak is believed to have started at a wholesale market in Wuhan, \nwhere vendors legally sold live animals, including wildlife, in close quarters, \nsparking debate about China\u2019s game trade. \u201cThis is where you get new and \nemerging diseases that the human population has never seen before,\u201d said Kevin \nJ. Olival, a biologist and vice president of research with EcoHealth Alliance, a\n nonprofit research organization. In response to the contagion, China \u2014 still \ncarrying the memory of SARS, the century\u2019s first coronavirus to make the leap to\n humans, which killed nearly 800 people \u2014 has temporarily banned the sale of \nwild animals and effectively placed more than 35 million people on lockdown, \nblocking expressways and canceling all flights and trains out of the region. \n[Related: Are the Quarantines Ethical and Effective?] It\u2019s the largest \nquarantine in history, but it\u2019s unlikely to contain the virus, writes Howard \nMarkel, a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan.  \nThe quarantine has taxed Wuhan\u2019s ability to care for its sick while doing little\n to prevent the virus\u2019s spread, Dr. Markel notes. Amid the Lunar New Year \nholiday, China\u2019s busiest travel season, some five million people had already \nleft the city before it was sealed. \u201cThe more we learn about it, the greater the\n possibility is that transmission will not be able to be controlled with public \nhealth measures,\u201d Dr. Allison McGeer, a Toronto-based infectious disease \nspecialist, told Helen Branswell at STAT News. \u201cI think that our first concern \ncan rightly be the people in China,\u201d the Columbia University epidemiologist \nSimon Anthony told Slate.  The quality of health care in China has not kept pace\n with the country\u2019s economic expansion, reports The Times\u2019s Sui-Lee Wee. \nStrained even during ordinary times, doctors are overwhelmed, and both medical \nequipment and space are in short supply.  \u201cIt is very scary,\u201d one Wuhan \nresident, whose wife developed a fever but was refused admission to hospitals, \ntold Ms. Wee. \u201cIf it\u2019s real, we have a child and elderly parents at home. What \nif we all get sick?\u201d But many experts say people in the United States shouldn\u2019t \npanic. The virus is thought to be less lethal than both SARS and MERS, the last \nzoonotic coronavirus to infect humans, in 2012. And the vast majority of \nconfirmed cases remain in mainland China, as Catherine Kim reported at Vox. \n\u201cMake no mistake, this is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a \nglobal health emergency,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general \nof the World Health Organization. Although the outbreak is a \u201cvery serious \npublic-health threat, the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low at this \ntime,\u201d Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said \nFriday. For perspective: The flu kills roughly 35,000 Americans every year. This\n season, it has already sickened an estimated 15 million Americans and killed \n8,200, according to C.D.C. estimates. Influenza kills more Americans every year \nthan any other virus, Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor College of \nMedicine, told Liz Sabo at Kaiser Health News. But the flu is rarely paid such \nattention, and fewer than half of adults get a vaccine.  \u201cWhen we think about \nthe relative danger of this new coronavirus and influenza, there\u2019s just no \ncomparison,\u201d Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical\n Center, told Ms. Sabo. \u201cCoronavirus will be a blip on the horizon in \ncomparison.\u201d \u201cIf Americans aren\u2019t afraid of the flu, perhaps that\u2019s because they\n are inured to yearly warnings,\u201d Ms. Sabo writes. \u201cFor them, the flu is old \nnews. Yet viruses named after foreign places \u2014 such as Ebola, Zika and Wuhan \u2014 \ninspire terror.\u201d The Beaverton, a satirical publication, summed up matters \nthusly:  \u2018We don\u2019t know how bad it will get\u2019 There\u2019s still a good deal we don\u2019t \nknow about the coronavirus. It\u2019s too early to determine exactly how deadly or \ncontagious it is, and as the Times columnist Nicholas Kristof has pointed out, \nthe Chinese government seems to have tried to play down the outbreak, perhaps \nundercounting the number of infections and deaths. A vaccine will probably not \nbe viable until this summer at the earliest. [Related: Read the W.H.O.\u2019s travel \nadvice and tips for how to protect yourself] The United States needs to do more \nto prepare for an epidemic, writes Dr. Saad B. Omer, the director of the Yale \nInstitute for Global Health. For one thing, he argues, there\u2019s little evidence \nthat President Trump is taking the potential threat from the coronavirus \nseriously enough. But more broadly, there are clear lessons to heed from the \nSARS and 2014 Ebola outbreaks:  The American response should be led by major \npublic health scientists and agencies, such as the C.D.C. and the National \nInstitutes of Health, rather than politicians: \u201cDecisions such as border \nscreenings, travel restrictions and potential quarantine have major public \nhealth consequences, and they should be driven by science and emerging \nbiological and epidemiological evidence,\u201d Dr. Omer writes. Congress also needs \nto fund the nationwide network of hospitals and treatment facilities established\n after the 2014 Ebola epidemic, which enables prompt testing and isolation of \npatients, write Ronald A. Klain, the former White House Ebola response \ncoordinator from 2014 to 2015, and Nicole Lurie, a former assistant secretary \nfor preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services. \nThat funding is set to expire in four months.  The coronavirus could also \nthreaten the global supply chain of pharmaceuticals, Ed Silverman reports. \nRoughly 80 percent of active ingredients used by commercial sources to produce \nfinished medicines come from China, he writes. Most ingredient production occurs\n several hundred miles east of Wuhan, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine the virus and\n the quarantine spreading in that direction, bringing with them the possibility \nof shortages. \u201cWe need a government entity that monitors global supply and \ndemand \u2014 and events like this outbreak \u2014 to understand our vulnerabilities, \npredict possibilities and have a plan to prepare, rather than scramble,\u201d \nRosemary Gibson, a health care and patient safety expert at the Hastings Center,\n told Mr. Silverman. \u201cWe track food supplies around the world. We do this for \nenergy supplies. We need to do the same thing for medicines.\u201d \u2018Disease and \ndiscrimination are two sides of the same coin\u2019 The first victim of an infectious\n disease outbreak is often rational decision-making, write Mr. Klain and Ms. \nLurie, which tends to open the door to discrimination in forms both malicious \nand misguided. Ann Coulter, a right-wing commentator, beseeched President Trump \non Twitter to ban travel from China. In New York City, one school district \ncanceled a field trip to Chinatown ahead of the Lunar New Year celebrations. One\n parent, Amy Lee-Ludovicy, a Hong Kong native, told The Times that she worried \nher two children were facing discrimination in ways they had not before. \u201cThey \nare being taught, \u2018Let\u2019s just stay away from them,\u2019\u201d she said. There is a \ntroubled history in predominantly white countries of racializing infectious \ndiseases, writes Alan Zheng in The Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cThe Ebola outbreak \nperpetuated images of the \u2018Dark Continent\u2019 and exacerbated existing patterns of \nxenophobia toward black communities,\u201d he writes, also noting how Haitians in the\n United States were barred from donating blood in the 1980s after being unfairly\n labeled a risk group for AIDS. \u201cReporting of the virus latches on to a double \nanomaly: the fear, speculation and uncertainty inherent in the spread of new \ndiseases, as well as a fascination with the darkened interiors of China \u2014 a \ncountry which continues to evade mainstream literacy in Australia and whose size\n and scale conjure fantasy at every turn,\u201d he writes.

Rozell,\n the author of a book on executive privilege, has written that George Washington\n laid the conceptual foundation for the power, though the term was not a part of\n common language until the Eisenhower administration.)

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Latin America\u2019s Radical Feminism Is Spreading Women \nin Chile, Brazil, Argentina and elsewhere know: Stopping violence against women \nstarts with politics and power. By Vanessa Barbara Contributing Opinion Writer \nS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 During the jury selection process for Harvey Weinstein\u2019s \ncriminal trial this month, dozens of women gathered outside a Manhattan \ncourthouse to perform a version of the dance/chant known as \u201cUn violador en tu \ncamino,\u201d or \u201cA Rapist in Your Path.\u201d First in Spanish, then in English, they \nsang: \u201cPatriarchy is our judge that imprisons us at birth/And our punishment is \nthe violence you don\u2019t see.\u201d This performance, which quickly went viral, was \ncreated last year by the feminist collective Lastesis in Valpara\u00edso, Chile, and \nis based on the work of the Argentine-Brazilian anthropologist Rita Segato. The \nlyrics describe how the state upholds systematic violations of women\u2019s rights, \nthrough institutions such as the judiciary and the police. It\u2019s not just that \nmembers of those institutions simply disregard the complaints \u2014 looking the \nother way, doubting the victims \u2014 but that they are often the perpetrators \nthemselves. \u201cThis oppressive state is a macho rapist,\u201d the chant goes. \u201cUn \nviolador en tu camino\u201d was first performed in front of a police station by a \nsmall group during a protest in Valpara\u00edso on Nov. 20. It was then repeated five\n days later in the capital, Santiago, by hundreds of activists on the \nInternational Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. In early \nDecember, a group of thousands sang the anthem together outside Santiago\u2019s \nNational Stadium, which was a detention and torture center during Chile\u2019s \nmilitary dictatorship. (In one verse, the song mentions the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of \nwomen.) From there, it has spread all over the world: London, Berlin, Paris, \nMadrid, Barcelona, Tel Aviv, New Delhi, Tokyo, Beirut, Istanbul, Mexico City, \nCaracas, Lima, Buenos Aires, among other places. In Manhattan, according to The \nAssociated Press, it caused \u201ca commotion so loud that it could be heard in a \n15th-floor courtroom.\u201d The choreographed dance begins with a driving drum beat, \nas the women do a side-to-side movement and stomp out the rhythm with their \nfeet. Many verses speak universally about the violence against women: They \nmention rape, femicide, impunity for the killers. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not my fault, not \nwhere I was, not how I dressed,\u201d they shout, as if collectively rebuffing the \nsame old forms of victim-blaming. But the performance also carries strong local \nelements that might go unnoticed by the broader public. One verse sarcastically \nquotes the Chilean police anthem word for word: \u201cSleep calmly, innocent girl/ \nWithout worrying about the bandit,/ Over your dreams smiling and sweet,/ watches\n your loving police.\u201d The title, \u201cA Rapist in Your Path,\u201d is also an ironic \nappropriation of an old slogan used by the national police, \u201ca friend in your \npath.\u201d The performance also makes references to police abuse in Chile, and by \nextension in neighboring countries. Part of the choreography includes squatting \ndown, hands behind the head, a common search procedure still performed in many \nLatin American countries: Police officers and prison wardens often force women \u2014\n sometimes even children \u2014 to squat, naked, in order to do a body cavity search.\n The activists wear a black lace blindfold as a symbol of the often invisible \nways that women are made vulnerable, but also as a nod to the hundreds of \nprotesters who were partly blinded by the Chilean police in the past three \nmonths. (Since the beginning of the demonstrations, Chilean\u2019s National Human \nRights Institute has filed 1,080 lawsuits against the state, 770 for allegations\n of torture and inhumane treatment and 158 for sexual abuse, including four \nrapes.) In Latin American countries, women performing the song also wear \npa\u00f1uelos verdes \u2014 the green scarves symbolizing the campaign for legal abortion.\n (The use of green scarves as an abortion-rights emblem derives from the white \nscarves carried by the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, whose children disappeared \nduring Argentina\u2019s military dictatorship.) But \u201cUn violador en tu camino\u201d is way\n more than its Latin American specificities. This is why it has spread so far \nand so quickly. It speaks about something that is true in too many countries \u2014 \nnot only Chile, Argentina or Brazil. \u201cThe rapist is you,\u201d the women repeat here \nand everywhere, either pointing to a courthouse, to the police headquarters or \nto the presidential palace. They mean that violations against women are not \nisolated events, not merely connected to interpersonal relations, but rather, \nessentially political. Activists point a finger at institutions that facilitate \ngender-based violence by systematically dehumanizing women and promoting \nideologies to keep them under control. For proof that this is really a global \npolitical issue, look to Turkey, where the police broke up a performance of the \nsong in Istanbul and confiscated the activists\u2019 megaphone. Six women were \narrested for supposedly insulting the president and degrading the institutions \nof the state. In a separate incident, courts issued arrest warrants for 25 women\n who protested in Izmir, while nine were detained. \u201cTurkey has become the only \ncountry where one has to have immunity to stage this protest,\u201d said a lawmaker, \nSera Kadigil, as she and other colleagues staged a version of the protest in the\n parliament. It should come as no surprise that female representatives make up \nonly 17 percent of the Turkish parliament and 11.8 percent of the ministerial \npositions. The country ranks 130th out of 153 countries in the World Economic \nForum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Report for 2020. Here in Brazil, we face similarly \ndepressing statistics. Activists here have added a couple of verses to the \nlyrics of \u201cUn violador,\u201d saying: \u201cMarielle is present. Her killer is a friend of\n our president.\u201d These refer to Marielle Franco, a Brazilian City Council member\n who was assassinated in 2018, and to the fact that President Jair Bolsonaro has\n ties to both of the suspects in the killing. (The investigation is ongoing.) In\n Brazil, women occupy 15 percent of the lower house seats and 9 percent of \nministerial positions. \u201cIt\u2019s the cops. It\u2019s the judges. It\u2019s the system. It\u2019s \nthe president. The rapist is you.\u201d According to the 2020 Global Gender Gap \nReport, the largest gender disparity in the world still lies in the sphere of \npolitical empowerment. I dare say that\u2019s where everything else begins. Only 25 \npercent of the 35,127 global parliamentary seats are taken up by women, a figure\n that drops to only 21 percent at the ministerial level. In nine of the 153 \ncountries the forum examines, women are not represented at all. Over the past 50\n years, 85 countries have had no female head of state. It is no wonder that \nwomen from Chile, where the song was created, are demanding gender parity for a \nforthcoming constitutional convention. There will be no justice for women as \nlong as we are kept out of the political process. There won\u2019t be any hope of \nequality. The rapists will continue while most of us stand powerless outside \ncourthouses, police stations and presidential palaces, furiously pointing at \nthem, to no avail.

I\u2019m basically a recycler. You know, I find other \npeople\u2019s stuff and junk and recycle it into my stuff and junk. I can\u2019t pass a \nyard sale. Action. Is that the word? Yeah, action. I come from a household where\n my mother was very artistic. In her era, women made quilts. They crocheted. \nThey did things with their hands. Women were not particularly encouraged to be \nartists, especially women of color, so design was my choice at school. Through \nthe years, I shifted into other kinds of art. My favorite probably is collage \nand assemblage, where I mix up materials, objects, ideas. Sometimes they tell a \nstory, and sometimes they don\u2019t. I prefer it when they don\u2019t tell a story, so \nthe viewer can invent their own story. I rarely look for a specific thing. I \njust kind of spot. I kind of go by my intuition. I can tell when a fan has \nsomething for me that I might use. At that time, there were very few black \nartists in Los Angeles. There was a larger community, a national community. They\n were having a conference in Chicago. So David Hammons and I decided that we \nwanted to go. During our spare time we went to the Field Museum. African art, \noceanic art, primitive art, and folk art were not really considered art, so they\n were down in the basement. And it was weird down there, because it was all this\n energy from these tribal kinds of materials. When we came back to California, \nthat was when I started doing the ancestral cast pieces, working with objects \nfrom Africa and organic things. When you know Betye and you start to really look\n into her work, you\u2019d think that she escaped from one of the pyramids or \nsomething, you know what I mean? She\u2019s just into a strong mystical quality. I \nwas always interested in alternative beliefs, palmistry and phonology, \nastrology, and so forth. In the \u201960s, I became more interested in what was \nhappening about feminism and racism. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., his murder was \nsomething that was really horrific for me and shocking. I remember how I felt \nphysically, just really angry and upset. But I was a mother with young children.\n I couldn\u2019t walk in protest. But I did have a weapon. And that was art. That was\n when I started using black derogatory images. I did this piece called \u2018The \nLiberation of Aunt Jemima,\u2019 because it went back to how black people were \nthought of as comical, or caricatures, or animals. And I wanted to do something \nto show my protest for that, so I made Aunt Jemima as a warrior, as a fighter. \nShe has a rifle and a hand grenade. She\u2019s taking care of business. I was really \nhesitant about putting that figure up there. Some people thought it was \nhumorous. But it did something that I didn\u2019t know it would do. It made people \nthink. It\u2019s been forever. Racism hasn\u2019t gone away. Has sexism gone away? No. So \nyou still have to keep repeating things. My daughter found this scale for me \u2014 \nthe weight of racism or so forth. I will probably paint the outside of it green \nand the inside red, so it looks like they\u2019re in a watermelon. That\u2019s my sense of\n humor. This sounds really gross. I applied for a National Endowment. And I \nreceived \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many thousand. But when I got that check, I looked \nin the mirror, and I said, \u201cOh, Betye Saar. You\u2019re really an artist.\u201d Before I \nwas just making stuff. I\u2019ve been used to being a long admirer of hers for a long\n time. And suddenly, everywhere I go, people talk about her work. We\u2019re in a \nculture that likes objects. You\u2019re attracted maybe to beauty, or to usefulness. \nOr there\u2019s other objects that you look and you\u2019re disgusted with them. \nEverything has a past, so I feel that that energy is somehow enclosed with the \nobject. What do I have now that\u2019s new? Antlers. That\u2019s my latest thing. Antlers.\n It\u2019s always a puzzlement when I start collecting things. Like, \u201cWhat can I do \nwith this? I mean, what\u2019s the point of that?\u201d And then I\u2019ll find another \ncomponent and it says, \u201cOh, yeah. I can use it here.\u201d It\u2019s a very selfish reason\n that I make art. Because I like doing it. I\u2019m in my 90s now. And all these \npieces are sitting around waiting for me to put them together. And time is the \nbiggest challenge. To find time to do it. I do have a birthday coming up. I\u2019m a \nLeo. It means that I am like the lion. It\u2019s best you not hear me roar. And \nthat\u2019s a wrap. Video by Christine Turner Ms. Turner is a filmmaker.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Mitch McConnell\u2019s Complicity Has Deep Roots With or \nwithout witnesses, Trump\u2019s trial shows that the antifederalists were right to \nquestion the Senate\u2019s purpose. By Jamelle Bouie Opinion Columnist Last week, \nafter Senate Republicans voted unanimously to approve their leader Mitch \nMcConnell\u2019s rules for President Trump\u2019s impeachment trial \u2014 fast-tracking the \nprocess and putting up barriers to the production of evidence and witnesses, \nRepresentative Jerry Nadler of New York, one of seven impeachment managers, \ndespaired over the strong chance that voters would not get a fair, comprehensive\n hearing of the case against the president. \u201cThe president is on trial in the \nSenate, but the Senate is on trial in the eyes of the American people. Will you \nvote to allow all the relevant evidence to be presented here? Or will you betray\n your pledge to be an impartial juror?\u201d Nadler said. \u201cSo far, I\u2019m sad to say, I \nsee a lot of senators voting for a cover-up, voting to deny witnesses, an \nabsolutely indefensible vote, obviously a treacherous vote.\u201d Republicans were \noutraged. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she was \u201coffended,\u201d while \nSenator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin called the House Judiciary chairman \u201cout of \nline.\u201d But Nadler wasn\u2019t wrong. With the White House\u2019s support, McConnell \ndesigned a pro forma trial meant to acquit Trump as quickly as possible. If \nSenate Republicans wanted witnesses, they would have to vote \u2014 with Democrats \u2014 \nto get them. The course of the trial is in their hands, and thus far, they\u2019ve \ntaken the path of least resistance, speeding toward an acquittal for the \npresident. Even John Bolton\u2019s earthquake of an account \u2014 the former national \nsecurity adviser says, among other things, that Trump wanted to freeze security \nassistance to Ukraine until officials there announced an investigation into Joe \nBiden \u2014 has yet to shake Republican resolve. The extent to which this changes is\n the extent to which McConnell thinks it hurts the Republican majority to \nstonewall a real trial. If, despite new revelations and public pressure, \nMcConnell can end the Senate trial without jeopardizing the president or that \nmajority, then he and his caucus will have successfully conspired to shield the \npresident from accountability. Nadler would be able to say he was vindicated. So\n too could the earliest critics of the Constitution. In talking and thinking \nabout impeachment, observers and participants have gone on (and on) about the \nfounding fathers: about Hamilton and Madison and the Federalist Papers. But \ntheir opponents, the antifederalists, also thought about the process. In their \nfight against the Constitution, they covered every inch of the new governing \ndocument, touching every section, every article and every clause. Looking from \nthe perspective of now \u2014 one week into the impeachment trial \u2014 it\u2019s striking to \nsee how, without knowledge of political parties or partisan factionalism, they \ncaptured the exact dynamic that will keep a corrupt president in office. The \nSenate was a sticking point for the antifederalists. With its small membership \nand fixed terms, they thought it was too aristocratic; with its mix of \nlegislative, executive and judicial powers, they thought it was too powerful. \n\u201cIs a body so vested with means to soften and seduce \u2014 so armed with power to \nscreen or to condemn \u2014 so fortified against suspicion and enquiry \u2014 so largely \ntrusted with legislative powers \u2014 so independent of and removed from the people \n\u2014 so tempted to abuse and extend those powers \u2014 is this a body which freeman \nought ever to create, or which freeman can ever endure?\u201d the writer \n\u201cCincinnatus\u201d asked in reply to James Wilson, a key delegate to the \nConstitutional Convention. To the antifederalists, the historian Jack Rakove \nnotes in \u201cOriginal Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the Making of the \nConstitution,\u201d the Senate \u201cloomed as a conspiratorial den\u201d that could collude \nwith the executive against the rest of the government. It could use its \nlegislative powers to strike down House legislation and its executive powers \u2014 \ntreaty-making and confirmation of presidential nominations \u2014 to govern without \nthe direct consent of the people. Here, again, is Cincinnatus: \u201cOne thing at \nleast is certain, that by making one branch of the legislature participant in \nthe executive, you not only prevent the legislature from being a check upon the \nexecutive, but you inevitably prevent its being checked or controuled by the \nother branch.\u201d The antifederalists looked to impeachment as a prime example of \neverything that was wrong with the Senate. Despite the expectations of the \nConstitutional Convention, the antifederalists did not think the Senate would \never remove the president, much less any other official it approved of. \u201cShould \nhe, contrary to probability, be impeached, he is afterwards to be tried and \nadjudged by the Senate, and without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members\n who shall be present, he cannot be convicted \u2014 This Senate being constituted a \nprivy council to the President, it is probable many of its leading and \ninfluential members may have advised or concurred in the very measures for which\n he may be impeached,\u201d Luther Martin, a delegate to the Constitutional \nConvention, observed in his November 1787 address to the Maryland legislature. \nLikewise, the writer known as \u201cFederal Farmer\u201d argued that the high bar to \nremoval and the deep entanglement of the Senate and the executive meant the \nimpeachment power was practically a dead letter. \u201cUnder these circumstances the \nright of impeachment, in the House, can be of but little importance; the House \ncannot expect often to convict the offender, and, therefore, probably, will but \nseldom or never exercise the right.\u201d And in an unpublished pamphlet, a young \nJames Monroe levied a similar critique of impeachment. \u201cIn the operation of this\n government,\u201d Monroe wrote, there might be offices \u201ccommitted against one \nquarter of the community\u201d that would be \u201chighly beneficial to others.\u201d In such a\n case, he asked, \u201ccould we expect from the representatives of these states a \ncandid or impartial decision against the interests of their constituents?\u201d If we\n define the \u201cinterests of their constituents\u201d as partisan interests \u2014 who wins, \nwho loses \u2014 then, to answer Monroe, we cannot actually expect those \nrepresentatives to make a \u201ccandid or impartial decision\u201d against the president \nwhen he\u2019s on the same side. It\u2019s what we saw with the Clinton impeachment and \nit\u2019s what we see now, as Republicans embrace Trump and rally to his defense. The\n Senate has not been a cabal in most of the ways antifederalists feared. \nSenators have not conspired to make themselves a permanent aristocracy or make \nseditious treaties with foreign powers. But the advent of political parties, the\n rise of strong partisanship and the growth of hyperpolarization have created \nsomething of a \u201cconspiratorial den\u201d among co-partisans in ostensibly rival \nbranches of government. Republican lawmakers have an interest in the political \nsurvival of the Republican president, just as Democratic lawmakers have an \nequivalent interest in the survival of a Democratic president. And for \nRepublicans under Trump specifically, their political survival depends on, in \nLuther Martin\u2019s words, \u201cthe favour of the President.\u201d Just ask Jeff Flake. The \ntrial against our corrupt chief executive is clearly slanted in his favor. If \nthe antifederalist opponents of the Constitution could see us struggling now, \nthey might just say, \u201cWe told you so.\u201d The Times is committed to publishing a \ndiversity of letters to the editor.
