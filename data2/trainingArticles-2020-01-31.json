            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by 12 Deaths in Mississippi Tell a Grim Story The only \nway to \u201cfix\u201d a problem like the American prison system is to end it. By Jamelle \nBouie Opinion Columnist Twelve people have died in Mississippi state prisons \nsince the start of the new year. Nine deaths occurred in the Mississippi State \nPenitentiary at Parchman. At least one was a suicide. Most were a result of \nviolence between inmates: beatings, stabbings and other fatal altercations. \nState officials have promised to stop the violence. After news of two of those \ndeaths broke last week, Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican who took office earlier \nthis month, said he would work \u201caround the clock\u201d with the state Department of \nCorrections to \u201crespond immediately\u201d and prevent new incidents \u201cgoing forward.\u201d \nWhat\u2019s striking about this situation is how little of it is new. The Parchman \nprison, which dates to 1904, has a long and infamous history of violence and \nabuse. It also has a history of reform. But no amount of change has been able to\n break the cycle of brutality. And why would it? The history of Parchman is a \nprime example of how dehumanization and neglect are intrinsic to separating \npeople from their freedom. The Mississippi of the late 19th century was a rigid \napartheid state, its criminal justice system defined by cruel, gratuitous \npunishment. Black suspects bore the brunt of state violence. Often arrested for \npetty crimes like theft, gambling and \u201cvagrancy\u201d \u2014 traveling without a work \npermit or evidence of a job \u2014 black Mississippians were given hefty fines and \nlengthy sentences. They were then leased out to private companies for de facto \nslave labor on railroads and plantations. Conditions were abysmal. \u201cThe \nprisoners ate and slept on bare ground, without blankets or mattresses, and \noften without clothes,\u201d writes the historian David Oshinsky in \u201cWorse Than \nSlavery: Parchman Farm and the Ordeal of Jim Crow Justice.\u201d \u201cConvicts dropped \nfrom exhaustion, pneumonia, malaria, frostbite, consumption, sunstroke, \ndysentery, gunshot wounds, and \u2018shackle poisoning\u2019 (the constant rubbing of \nchains and leg irons against bare flesh).\u201d In the 1880s, Oshinsky notes, the \nannual mortality rate for Mississippi\u2019s convict population ranged from 9 percent\n to 16 percent. Convict leasing was on the wane by the turn of the last century,\n but Mississippi\u2019s white elite was still obsessed with \u201cNegro crime.\u201d Enter Gov.\n James K. Vardaman. Elected in 1903 on a demagogic platform of rural chauvinism \nand white supremacy \u2014 he promised to tax the planters, give aid to the (white) \npoor and turn back \u201csocial equality\u201d \u2014 Vardaman was a kind of reformer. He \nopposed convict leasing as a public giveaway to wealthy landowners and an \noppressive burden on impoverished offenders, including blacks. \u201cVardaman would \nspend a lifetime fighting to deny blacks political rights and social equality,\u201d \nexplains Oshinsky, \u201cYet he also believed that Negroes who accepted their lowly \nplace in the human order should be protected from abuse.\u201d Vardaman wanted a \nprison that would socialize black criminals into, as Oshinsky paraphrases the \nidea, \u201cproper discipline, strong work habits, and respect for white authority.\u201d \nHe also wanted it to turn a profit. Under his leadership, the state cleared \nthousands of acres near the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta in an area called Parchman \nplace, named after the family that had owned it for years. Workers planted crops\n and constructed prison buildings. The Parchman Penitentiary was born. By the \n1910s it was self-sufficient, operating on the same principles as an antebellum \nplantation, with black convict laborers supervised by white overseers, although \nthe share of white prisoners would increase with time. Parchman would, in short \norder, become notorious for its hard labor and brutality. (The blues musician \nBukka White immortalized his experience of the prison in a 1940 song, \u201cParchman \nFarm Blues.\u201d) Inmates slept on dirt floors. Violence was common. In 1954 \nofficials added a maximum security unit where one prisoner recalled, \u201cthey just \nbeat the living crap out of you.\u201d Serious reform would come after the Civil \nRights movement with Gates v. Collier, a class-action lawsuit filed in 1971 on \nbehalf of four inmates but constructed with testimony from hundreds of \nprisoners. They attested to murders, rapes, beatings and tortures \u2014 one inmate, \nDanny Bennett, died after he was shocked with cattle prods and left unconscious \nunder the sun in 100-degree heat. They also spoke to poor conditions, from open \nsewage and polluted water supplies to \u201ckitchens overrun with insects, rodents, \nand the stench of decay.\u201d A federal judge would describe the prison as \u201cunfit \nfor human habitation.\u201d Decided for good in 1974, Gates would essentially create \nminimum standards for incarceration in the United States. At Parchman, this \nmeant desegregation and civilian guards, freedom of worship, minimum living \nspace and an end to forced labor. It also spurred the state of Mississippi to \ncreate a Department of Corrections to oversee its penal facilities. But reform \nhad limits. New facilities and professional staff doesn\u2019t change the fact that \nprisons are a place of confinement, where society isolates many of its least-\nwanted and most vulnerable members. By the 1990s, according to a report from the\n American Civil Liberties Union, death row prisoners at Parchman \u2014 renamed \nMississippi State Penitentiary \u2014 reported \u201cprofound isolation, unrelieved \nidleness and monotony, denial of exercise, intolerable stench and pervasive \nfilth, grossly malfunctioning plumbing, and constant exposure to human \nexcrement.\u201d H.I.V. positive prisoners in the general population told lawyers \nfrom the A.C.L.U. that they \u201cwere living in squalor, categorically segregated \nfrom the rest of the prison population, and barred from all prison educational \nand vocational programs and jobs.\u201d Assaults between inmates, often part of rival\n gangs, remained common. Parchman is hardly alone in its history of violence and\n neglect. If anything, it\u2019s just an extreme example of conditions that occur \nthroughout American prisons. Even so, there\u2019s worse. Last year, the Department \nof Justice released a 56-page report on the Alabama prison system, where guards \nare few and far between and where prisoners experience high rates of homicide \nand sexual assault, where \u2014 The New York Times reported \u2014 \u201cOne prisoner had been\n dead for so long that when he was discovered lying face down, his face was \nflattened.\u201d The nation\u2019s jails \u2014 local facilities where arrestees are placed \npending trial or sentencing \u2014 aren\u2019t much better. According to the most recent \ndata, a 2015 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1,053 people died in \nlocal jails in 2014. The leading cause, suicide, accounted for 35 percent of \nthose deaths. Change, for Parchman and other facilities, will almost certainly \ncome. We should understand, however, that reform is only ever temporary. There\u2019s\n only so much you can do within the paradigm of incarceration. A prison may or \nmay not be humane, but it will always be dehumanizing. The isolation, the lack \nof liberty \u2014 the separation from family and community \u2014 are antithetical to \nhuman life. In which case, the only way to \u201cfix\u201d a problem like the American \nprison system is to end it. But for an unequal, racially stratified country like\n ours, that destination is on the far horizon, if it\u2019s on the horizon at all. \nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by News analysis What Does It Mean to Have a Serious \nDrinking Problem? Alcohol was my stress reducer, my reality fighter, the \nconferrer of artificial joys. It was also wreaking havoc on my life. By Nancy \nWartik Ms. Wartik works in The Times\u2019s Community Department. One day in the fall\n of 2018, I woke up feeling wrecked. The night before I\u2019d had beers with \ncolleagues and wound up braying loudly to one of them about something she\u2019d \nconfided and what I thought she should do. \u201cI wish I\u2019d never told you this,\u201d she\n finally blurted, and I knew I\u2019d betrayed a trust. A few nights before, I\u2019d been\n more inept. A group of us had held a memorial for a friend. At a gathering \nlater, I\u2019d had a martini with prosecco chasers, then picked a senseless quarrel \nwith our hostess, a close friend as bereaved as I was. Now I sat there, head \npounding, stomach roiling. It was another in a string of mornings when I\u2019d woken\n wanting to smother myself with a pillow. Booze: It didn\u2019t take much for me to \nfeel the effects. Alcohol could make nights glittery and fun, make me love all \nhumankind. It could also, and unpredictably, rouse demons that turned me into a \nwifely shrew, sparked bruising arguments, unleashed embarrassing faux pas. This \nmorning, a new thought struck, penetrating to the bone. \u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore. \nI quit.\u201d Although I\u2019d grappled for decades with my relationship to alcohol, I \ndidn\u2019t consider myself an alcoholic. In online quizzes asking how many drinks I \ntypically had per day, I could fairly accurately answer \u201ctwo\u201d (very generous \ndrinks). On the World Health Organization\u2019s AUDIT quiz, which tests for drinking\n problems, I scored eight of 40 points, making me a \u201cmedium\u201d drinker with a \n\u201crisky\u201d pattern. But medium didn\u2019t sound too bad and the website said I could \nalter my drinking \u201cwithout too much difficulty.\u201d Plus, I had the vaunted female \ntriumvirate: husband, kid, respectable job. Friends, when they weren\u2019t mad at \nme. O.K., sometimes I overdid it. But it was easy to imagine myself as your \naverage fun-loving Parisian oenophile. And yet. I was in my late teens when I \ndiscovered what alcohol could do: quash my inhibitions; kindle false intimacies;\n provoke brilliant revelations that I soon forgot. Alcohol made me the outgoing \nperson my unconfident self wanted to be, let me talk to people I normally \nwouldn\u2019t have. Yes, occasionally I awoke to see a head on the adjoining pillow \nand felt a bolt of regret. \u201cDamn! Why did this guy seem cute last night?\u201d But \nI\u2019d call a friend: \u201cGuess what I did this time?\u201d I\u2019d ask, turning discomfort \ninto a hilarious anecdote. Or a friend would inform me of my revelry: \u201cNancy, \nthe bartender threw you out. You couldn\u2019t stay on your stool.\u201d Alcohol was also \nmedication. I drank to quiet angst or because I was lonesome. I drank, it took \nyears to realize, because I had clinical depression. Eventually I treated the \ndepression but kept drinking. Alcohol was my stress reducer, my reality fighter,\n the conferrer of artificial joys. Life changed in my 40s. I married, and with \nmy husband, adopted our beloved daughter, now 17. Working from home, I made \ndinner, drinking wine with a neighbor mom. My morning-after headaches were \nworsening, though. Nights, rather than reading or chatting with my husband, I\u2019d \ncrash. I feared my drinking was destroying brain cells. I\u2019d written about how \nalcohol is harder on women than men and that worried me, too. Some years ago, to\n prove I had control, I cut down to five nights a week. It was tough. How could \nI not drink after a rough day? I couldn\u2019t manage two consecutive sober nights. \nAchieving my two sober nights was always an exercise in military-level \nstrategizing. But every Sunday, I felt virtuous. An actual alcoholic couldn\u2019t \nskip any nights, I thought. But I could. What does it mean to have a serious \ndrinking problem? The answer is surprisingly vague. \u201cAlcoholism\u201d isn\u2019t an actual\n diagnosis. In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s authoritative \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders established two different \nclassifications: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In 2013, the D.S.M. \ncombined the categories to create \u201calcohol use disorder,\u201d a spectrum ranging \nfrom mild to severe, based not on how much someone drinks but on how many of 11 \nbehavioral or psychological symptoms a person has. Meanwhile, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention has its own standards, focused more on quantity \nof alcoholic consumption. Seven drinks per week or fewer is considered safe for \nwomen, 14 or fewer for men. But guidelines fluctuate internationally, according \nto a Stanford University study from 2016. In Canada or France, you can drink \nmore weekly and be considered \u201clow risk.\u201d Moreover, a recent study in The Lancet\n concluded alcohol is so tough on health that there\u2019s no safe level. In short, \nif you wonder whether you drink too much, sometimes it\u2019s best to trust your gut.\n I don\u2019t know exactly what happened that fall morning as I sat in bed, achy and \nhumiliated. As viscerally as I\u2019ve known anything, I knew I was in trouble. So \nwhat if I didn\u2019t swig a bottle of Scotch daily? I\u2019d hit \u201cmedium drinker\u201d rock \nbottom and it was enough. Despite the website saying I could change my drinking \n\u201cwithout too much difficulty,\u201d quitting booze is one of the hardest things I\u2019ve \never done. I pined for it: At restaurants, I\u2019d gaze at ruby goblets as if at a \ndivine elixir. After workouts I\u2019d crave a beer. And what was the point of \nsocializing sober? Eventually, I had to try. Guzzling nonalcoholic beer \u2014 before\n I wisely switched to seltzer \u2014 while chatting with people savoring complex \npinot noirs was initially daunting. But astonishingly, my non-intoxicated brain \nstill found what they said funny, touching or interesting. I didn\u2019t join A.A., \nthough I don\u2019t rule it out. I sought support from my husband, daughter and \nfriends \u2014 those I\u2019d offended, those surprised I even had a problem. I devoured \nothers\u2019 stories, watching movies about alcoholics, reading memoirs, lurking in \nsub-Reddits for people struggling to quit. But what really kept me on the path \nwas the remarkable difference between the drinking and not drinking me. I hadn\u2019t\n grasped the degree to which a sense of shame had insidiously undergirded my \nlife. Now it was gone, replaced by an unaccustomed pride. The longer I \nabstained, the better I felt, in ways that spilled into marriage, work, \nparenting, friendships. Recently, someone unaware I\u2019d quit told me I looked \nyears younger. I\u2019m more patient. My headaches are infrequent, my energy up. \nThose results fit with a study published in the Canadian Medical Association \nJournal, among the first focused on moderate drinkers\u2019 mental health. \nResearchers studying cohorts of people in Hong Kong and the United States found \neven \u201csafe\u201d drinkers, women in particular, showed improved well-being if they \nstopped. Today, I can label myself. I had moderate alcohol use disorder, a \n\u201cchronic relapsing brain disease\u201d marked by loss of control over alcohol. The \nNational Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse says 6.2 percent of American \nadults, more than 15 million people, are on the alcohol use disorder spectrum. \n(Other research puts the numbers higher.) I\u2019d guess many, like me, drink \nmodestly enough that they don\u2019t believe they have a problem. I feel lucky I quit\n before anything worse happened. Sobriety can still be a challenge. If all goes \naccording to plan, I\u2019ll never again experience the soft scrim that drops between\n me and reality, as wine drains from my glass. It seems sad, until I remember \nthat three times since quitting, I\u2019ve tried a celebratory drink. Most recently, \nin Peru, I had one of the country\u2019s famous pisco sours. It gave me a mild buzz \nand a hangover. I haven\u2019t had a drop since. These days, I awaken clearheaded. \nI\u2019m closer than ever to being the mother, wife, relative and friend I want to \nbe. It feels good. Really good. I get up the next morning. I do it again. Nancy \nWartik works in The Times\u2019s Community Department.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Britain Is Leaving. Europe Has to Change. There\u2019s an \nenormous danger in doing nothing. By Jochen Bittner Contributing Opinion Writer \nHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 It\u2019s happening: The United Kingdom is leaving the European \nUnion on Friday. After decades of steady enlargement, the organization will lose\n its first member. What can be done to prevent the continent splitting further \napart? The question is at least being posed by some. President Emmanuel Macron \nof France has called for an unsparing conference on the future of Europe, the \ndetails of which the commission set out last week. The aim is to allow for an \n\u201copen, inclusive and transparent debate.\u201d Well, here is a proposal that might \nnot go down well in Brussels: Make the European Union more flexible. Or watch it\n break. Why the radicalism? Because the nagging core question for the bloc \u2014 \nwhat are the advantages of an often unwieldy union of 27 countries over a single\n nation-state? \u2014 has not vanished just because the British have answered it for \nthemselves. Crises over both the euro and migration have cast lasting doubts \nover the union\u2019s fundamental promise, that pooling individual sovereignty would \nresult in greater sovereignty for all members of the club. At least in the \neastern part of the Continent, more and more Europeans want less Europe. The \nsupport for right-wing, populist parties in the region shows that love for the \nWest has turned into disillusionment. In 2016, the foreign minister of Poland, \nWitold Waszczykowski, complained of \u201c25 years of leftist and liberal \nindoctrination.\u201d In 2017, Maria Schmidt, one of Prime Minister Viktor Orban of \nHungary\u2019s favorite intellectuals, gave \u201cWillkommenskultur,\u201d Chancellor Angela \nMerkel of Germany\u2019s idea that Europe should welcome newly arriving migrants, a \nroasting. \u201cI think it is just bullshit,\u201d Ms. Schmidt said. This crack has \nanything but healed, partly because powerful Western Europeans like Ms. Merkel \nor Mr. Macron do not seem to care much about their frenemies in Warsaw, Budapest\n or Prague. The East\u2019s demagoguery is met by the West\u2019s condescension. \nTragically, this is very much the repeat of a mistake made in the years before \nthe Brexit vote. When I asked German diplomats in 2014 how they reacted to \ncriticism of the bloc\u2019s performance by Britain\u2019s prime minister, David Cameron, \nthey shrugged and replied that they were sitting down with their British \ncounterparts in \u201ctherapy sessions.\u201d The thought that the European Union itself \nmight also need therapy did not cross their minds. But what kind of therapy does\n it need? Let\u2019s try an analysis first. The former German chancellor Helmut \nSchmidt used to say that the bloc simply grew too large to successfully bundle \ntogether the interests of all its member states. When the union consisted of six\n countries, decision-making was easy. When it grew to 12 that became harder. \nToday, with nearly 30, it might just have reached operational overstretch. Which\n is why a cure has to address the root of the problem: the outmoded binary \nchoice of either all-in or all-out membership. As it currently stands, a \nEuropean country can either be a member state with full voting rights that is \nexpected to take part in all efforts at further integration. Or it cannot be a \nmember at all. Rather than sticking to this all-or-nothing choice, Europe should\n allow flexible memberships or \u2014 to use a term hated in Brussels \u2014 \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d \narrangements: instead of the full menu, a little bit of this, a little bit of \nthat. A country would like to take part in more military integration yet stay \nout the eurozone? Why not? And why not be a member of the single market without \nhaving to subscribe to Europe\u2019s asylum policy? There are of course things that \ncannot be open to pick-and-choose, like participation in the single market \nitself and the obligation to abide by its so-called \u201cfour freedoms\u201d \u2014 of goods, \nservices, capital and people. Switzerland and Norway, for instance, are not \nmembers of the European Union but are part of the bloc\u2019s single market. They \nhave no involvement in certain policies, for example for agriculture and \nfisheries, and of course they have no say on political questions. In other \nwords: If states accept certain inviolable conditions, then they should be free \nto abstain from certain policies they regard as disadvantages. It is often said \nthat this runs counter to the idea of club, in which rights necessarily \ncorrespond with duties. But would you want to join a club that will let you play\n tennis only if you also enroll for boxing, gambling, fishing \u2014 and a cooking \ncourse too? A \u201cTeam European Union\u201d of various coalitions of the willing could \nproduce more clout than one big coalition of the half-willing. It would also \nhave strategic upsides: Flexible membership would allow for a bespoke approach \nto the Western Balkan states. For as long as they don\u2019t fulfill the accession \ncriteria, they still could be more closely associated with the single market, \npreventing them from falling prey to the encroachment of Russia and China. \nWhat\u2019s more, an opt-in union could open ways to reintegrate Britain, should \npublic opinion on Brexit shift one day. Sure, there\u2019s a huge risk in such a \nradical reform. Once opened, the complex legal body of the union\u2019s treaties \ncould face the fate of Humpty Dumpty: All the king\u2019s horses and all the king\u2019s \nmen might not be able to put it together again. Yet there is also an enormous \ndanger in doing nothing. Imagine if Brexit does not reduce Britain to misery but\n instead leaves the country relatively unscathed. In that case, the very idea of\n Europe \u2014 that the combined power of many states results in more power for the \nindividual state \u2014 could suffer another major blow. And this time, it could be \nterminal. Jochen Bittner (@JochenBittner) is a co-head of the debate section for\n the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by For Better or Worse, Trump Will Get His Favorite \nThings on Super Bowl Sunday His pregame interview with Sean Hannity offers \nunfettered airtime in front of a huge national audience. By Will Leitch Mr. \nLeitch is too Midwestern in his soul to not cheer for the Kansas City Chiefs in \nSuper Bowl LIV. Of all the surreal things I\u2019ve seen during Super Bowl telecasts \nin my lifetime \u2014 the wardrobe malfunction, Left Shark, whatever in the world \nthey\u2019re doing to poor Mr. Peanut \u2014 I\u2019m not sure anything feels more discordant \nwith the way we live today than the fact that Bill O\u2019Reilly interviewed \nPresident Barack Obama before two Super Bowls. Yep, they did it twice. The first\n was in 2011, when Mr. O\u2019Reilly joked that he needed to leave before Jennifer \nLopez showed up for the White House Super Bowl party. (He also asked Mr. Obama \nif it disturbed him \u201cthat so many people hate you.\u201d) They chatted again in 2014,\n a more contentious discussion in which Mr. O\u2019Reilly grilled the president over \na range of topics like the Benghazi attacks and why the president didn\u2019t fire \nKathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, for the flawed \nopening of the Obamacare website. It nevertheless ended with Mr. O\u2019Reilly \nsaying, \u201cI think your heart is in the right place,\u201d and then cheerfully asking \nMr. Obama who he thought would win the game. Watching the interviews today, even\n with Mr. O\u2019Reilly going on about Benghazi and potential \u201ccorruption\u201d at the \nI.R.S., feels like correspondence from another galaxy. This Sunday afternoon, \nbefore the San Francisco 49ers take on the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIV,\n President Trump will speak with Sean Hannity on Fox, the network airing the \nSuper Bowl. As you might suspect, this interview will be a much more insular \nenterprise. Mr. Trump speaks regularly with Mr. Hannity, who is seen as an \ninformal but influential adviser, and Mr. Hannity has been in return a staunch, \nunyielding defender of the president. It will mark the third time Mr. Trump will\n do the traditional interview before America\u2019s annual television holiday; he \nspoke to Mr. O\u2019Reilly in 2017, took 2018 off because the game was aired on NBC, \nand famously told Margaret Brennan of CBS that he wouldn\u2019t allow his son Barron \nto play football because it\u2019s \u201creally tough\u201d and \u201ca dangerous sport.\u201d This \nyear\u2019s Super Bowl comes at an amazing moment, a confluence of political \ncircumstances and events that give this particular bully pulpit a power and a \nspotlight it hasn\u2019t had in years. With impeachment, the Iowa caucuses and the \nState of the Union all on deck, Mr. Trump will have a stage, and a famously \npliant interviewer, that is unparalleled in American culture. He couldn\u2019t ask \nfor a more ideal year for it to be Fox\u2019s turn to air the game. It wasn\u2019t long \nago that the N.F.L. owners were terrified of Mr. Trump, and with good reason: He\n called the players kneeling to protest social injustice and police brutality \n\u201csons of bitches\u201d and said that owners should \u201cfire\u201d the players and drag them \noff the field, lighting a fire to an already combustible situation with the \nleague. But the N.F.L., like so many Republican politicians, has largely caved \nto Mr. Trump\u2019s desires. And Mr. Hannity is, suffice it to say, unlikely to turn \nup much heat on the president. It\u2019s worth noting that friendly, back-scratching \ninterviews are much more in the spirit of this tradition \u2014\u00a0like the one before \nthe \u201cSuper Bowl Shuffle\u201d Chicago Bears\u2019 win in 1986 in Super Bowl XX, in which \nTom Brokaw asked Ronald Reagan about his own playing career. (The year before, \nReagan did the coin flip from the White House.) It didn\u2019t become a real \ntradition until Mr. Obama decided to do one every year, with non-sports \njournalists like Scott Pelley of CBS and Savannah Guthrie of NBC. Mr. O\u2019Reilly \nbrought a more combative, feet-to-the-fire style to his, but still, the general \ntone of both his interviews was friendly, even cordial, and the subtext was, \n\u201cLet\u2019s all try to come together on the Super Bowl.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine any \nsort of \u201ccome together\u201d moment in a Trump-Hannity interview. Still, it could be \na perfect time for Mr. Trump to have a puff piece interview on national \ntelevision, the perfect excuse for one and Mr. Hannity the perfect host. The \nN.F.L. is experiencing one of its most scandal-free years in recent memory. In \nthe time since the league came under attack from the president, it has banned \nkneeling before games and mostly eluded controversy. The man who hated the \nN.F.L. for not letting him buy the Bills and calling the league \u201csoft\u201d is now \nhappily going on the pregame show to their biggest event. As it turns out, maybe\n the N.F.L. and Mr. Trump need each other after all. But more than anything, the\n Super Bowl is a big honking television production, and whatever else you want \nto say about Mr. Trump, he certainly understands the power of that medium. In \nmany ways, his interviews, and Mr. Obama\u2019s before him, illustrate once again \njust what is so different about each of them. Mr. Obama did the pre-Super Bowl \ninterviews because he thought it would be a way to unite an increasingly \ndividing nation, even showing that he was willing to sit down with a supposed \nnemesis like Mr. O\u2019Reilly. But Mr. Trump, when it comes to television, is much \nmore cynical, cunning and savvier than that. Mr. Trump sees the Super Bowl hype \nas a way to sit down with his friendliest interviewer and speak directly to a \nmassive audience at a time of maximum peril \u2014 and maximum opportunity. Mr. Obama\n may have been right to sit down with Mr. O\u2019Reilly. But he opened the door to \nMr. Trump, in 2020, getting exactly what he covets: unfettered airtime to the \nwhole country. If Mr. Hannity asks Mr. Trump who he thinks is going to win, San \nFrancisco or Kansas City, I don\u2019t expect an honest answer; I just expect some \nsort of San Francisco-Nancy Pelosi crack. It makes you downright miss Left \nShark.This op-ed has been updated to reflect news developments.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Did I Just Get Yanged? Andrew Yang is showing what \nhealthy populism looks like. By Bari Weiss Ms. Weiss is an Opinion staff writer \nand editor and the author of \u201cHow to Fight Anti-Semitism.\u201d It was New Year\u2019s \nEve, and I had decided to spend it with Andrew Yang. A self-described \u201cAsian man\n who\u2019s good at math,\u201d Mr. Yang had raised an impressive $16.5 million in the \nfourth quarter of 2019 for his presidential campaign. Despite being newly flush,\n the campaign didn\u2019t hold its shindig in a Napa Valley wine cave or at Gramercy \nTavern, but in a fluorescent-lit room above a bar in Nashua, N.H. The party \nlooked like nothing so much as a high school dance if you had banned the \nbullies. There was a modest buffet of meatballs, spanakopita, Ritz crackers and \nCheddar cheese. The D.J., a boomer with trousers that badly need hemming, could \nhave been your chemistry teacher bouncing to Cardi B. Now, a few days away from \nthe Iowa caucus, Mr. Yang has outlasted more than a dozen candidates, including \nthree senators and two governors. He came in first among Democrats in the Iowa \nYouth Straw Poll on Tuesday. Next week, he\u2019ll be back on the debate stage. He \nremains a very long shot: National polls have him consistently in the second \ntier, right next to Amy Klobuchar. Still, conventional wisdom would say that \nAndrew Yang should be nowhere this close to the American presidency. I went to \nNew Hampshire because I wanted to understand how a political rookie with what \nseemed like little going for him beyond a signature proposal of free money and \nrelentlessly upbeat online fans had gotten this far. What does the URL \ncandidate\u2019s campaign look like IRL? That night, the Yang Gang, as the \ncandidate\u2019s fans proudly call themselves, was a happy crowd of gamers, former \ngoth girls, Burning Man enthusiasts, sci-fi geeks, students, coders and stoners.\n When Mr. Yang dropped a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d joke \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s like the Eye of Sauron\n is closing in!\u201d he said of his momentum in the race \u2014 they erupted in laughter.\n Hardcore Yang voters are not cool. And that is exactly their, and his, appeal. \nAmong the partygoers on New Year\u2019s Eve were Jackie and Dave Farrell, former \nBernie Sanders supporters who own a deli in Caldwell, N.J. Mr. Farrell wore a \nhandmade knitted beanie stitched with the words \u201cYang,\u201d \u201cMath,\u201d \u201cVote\u201d and \n\u201c2020\u201d; Ms. Farrell had a pink Yang Gang baseball hat over her blue hair and a \ncopy of the candidate\u2019s best seller, \u201cThe War on Normal People,\u201d in her purse. \nThey fell in love inside an online role playing game called HoboWars. It\u2019s hard \nto imagine anyone at a Joe Biden event with that kind of meet-cute. \u201cHe actually\n sold me a guild,\u201d Ms. Farrell told me. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a gang. Like a Yang \ngang.\u201d Talk to anyone in the Yang Gang for a few minutes and they\u2019ll inevitably \ntell you how they got Yanged. The story almost always begins with a younger \nperson telling an older person to Google Andrew Yang. Which is exactly what \nhappened with the Farrells. In August, a 23-year-old employee in the deli \napproached Ms. Farrell to ask whom she was supporting. \u201cI was like: \u2018Bernie, I \nguess. I supported him in 2016,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd he goes, \u2018Why haven\u2019t you \nGoogled Andrew Yang yet?\u201d So she did. \u201cI literally stayed up till 4 a.m. that \nnight watching videos.\u201d Have you ever been the target of a Twitter mob? It\u2019s \nabout as pleasant as a Brazilian wax in slow motion. The one thing that brings a\n small measure of comfort when you are in the digital cross hairs is the \nfollowing assertion: The internet is not real life. It is true, at least for the\n time being, that a horde of pixels cannot transform itself into a horde of \npeople. But the lie that there is a bright line between the online world and the\n \u201creal\u201d one has been well and truly debunked. Just ask any middle-school girl \nshamed for an Instagram post, or any adult fired because of a bad tweet, or any \nDemocrat hoping to oust Donald Trump and become the 46th president of the United\n States. Bernie Sanders may be fueled by his zealous fans on social media, but \nof all the Democrats running for president, the web means the most to Andrew \nYang. Without it, his candidacy simply wouldn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a classic underdog \nstory: a political unknown, ignored by the mainstream media, sidestepping the \npundits who had considered him a punchline. \u201cIn the early days there weren\u2019t \nmany people in cable news clamoring to have me on their shows,\u201d he told me over \nbubble tea on a recent afternoon in his Manhattan campaign headquarters. \u201cAnd so\n you seek out people who can reach lots of Americans.\u201d Those people were the \nones with podcasts. \u201cWhat launched us was Sam Harris,\u201d said Mr. Yang of his June\n 2018 appearance on Mr. Harris\u2019s show \u201cMaking Sense.\u201d It put him on the map: \u201cI \nwas invited to speak at the Wing Ding in Iowa\u201d \u2014 a major Democratic fund-raising\n event \u2014 \u201cbecause one of the people there was a Sam Harris fan.\u201d Mr. Harris \nintroduced him to Joe Rogan, a mixed martial arts color commentator who hosts \none of the most popular podcasts in the country. (Disclosure: I\u2019ve also appeared\n on his show.) \u201cJoe Rogan was the game changer,\u201d Mr. Yang said. \u201cWe raised tens \nof thousands of dollars a day for awhile there and a million bucks in a week.\u201d \nBut it isn\u2019t simply that Mr. Yang cleverly used new platforms to his advantage. \nSure, the podcasts gave him a big boost, but lots of politicians have used new \nmedia to expand their reach: Franklin Roosevelt commandeered the radio; Team \nObama mastered the email blast; President Trump tears up Twitter. Mr. Yang\u2019s \noutsize success shows that the people who insist that Rachel Maddow has more \ninfluence over the American electorate than Mr. Rogan are lying to themselves \nabout where cultural power in America is actually located. What Mr. Yang \nunderstands is that the old rules no longer apply \u2014 and that flouting those \nrules is an energizing strategy. But while Donald Trump burned the whole house \ndown, Andrew Yang is dunking on the system with a big smile. That\u2019s how he gets \nonstage at a Democratic debate, points out the ridiculousness of the artifice \u2014 \n\u201cWe\u2019re up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing \nroles in this reality TV show\u201d \u2014 and walks away with one of the most talked-\nabout moments of the night despite having had the least talking time. His appeal\n is a powerful reminder that the animating political conflict of our era may not\n be left versus right, but establishment versus insurgency. The Yang campaign \nprides itself on the heterodoxy of its supporters. \u201cI poll 18 percent among \ncollege Republicans,\u201d Mr. Yang told me. \u201cI\u2019ve got a higher appeal among \nindependents, libertarians and even some disaffected Trump voters than Joe Biden\n by the numbers, than Bernie Sanders by the numbers.\u201d One of his campaign \nslogans is \u201cNot Left. Not Right. Forward.\u201d The writer Wesley Yang has suggested \nthat the in-between nature of Asian-Americans \u2014 the way they are often regarded \nneither as white nor as people of color \u2014 allows them \u201cto say and do things that\n white liberals are now afraid to say and do, which is to stand up for certain \nfundamental values.\u201d When you consider Mr. Yang\u2019s positions on some of the \ntouchiest aspects of the culture war and imagine his views coming out of the \nmouth of a Michael Bennet or a Pete Buttigieg, you can easily see the truth of \nthis insight. For instance: He\u2019s glad that America has become \u201cless of a \nmonoculture.\u201d (When he was a kid, he says, his own \u201cefforts to be American \nincluded things like joining the wrestling team\u201d; he was terrible at the sport.)\n But, he added, \u201cI think there\u2019s a middle ground where you can\u2019t just say \nAmerica is nothing and everybody run off and do your own thing.\u201d It\u2019s important,\n he said, to have a \u201ccommon cultural context and even \u2014 and this will be very \ncontroversial \u2014 a common language of expression.\u201d I spoke to some of his many \nAsian-American supporters, and this resonated with them. Michael Chen, a \n19-year-old Drexel student at one of the New Hampshire town hall events, said he\n appreciated that Mr. Yang, whose immigrant father grew up in a house with a \ndirt floor on a peanut farm, is not running on his identity: \u201cYou can be Asian-\nAmerican, you can be black American, you can be Latino-American, but the common \ndenominator is American. That\u2019s who he is.\u201d Mr. Chen was there with his dad, \nJack. The elder Mr. Chen calls himself a \u201cYang junkie\u201d but insists being Asian \nhas \u201clittle to do with it.\u201d What animates him is the practicality of Mr. Yang\u2019s \nsolutions. Mr. Yang believes in talking to people he disagrees with. In April, \nhe appeared on \u201cThe Ben Shapiro Show,\u201d a no-go zone for those who buy into the \nnew politics of contamination \u2014 that to sit next to a conservative like Mr. \nShapiro is to tacitly endorse his ideas. \u201cThinking that I\u2019m going to catch ideas\n from someone seems ludicrous to me,\u201d he said. Soon after the comedian Shane \nGillis was hired by \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d it was revealed that he had used \nracial slurs on podcasts, including describing Mr. Yang with an anti-Semitic and\n racist epithet. Mr. Yang tweeted that he didn\u2019t think Mr. Gillis should be \nfired, writing, \u201cWe would benefit from being more forgiving rather than \npunitive.\u201d The show didn\u2019t follow Mr. Yang\u2019s advice. I asked Mr. Yang, who ran \none of the top test prep programs in the country before it was bought by Kaplan,\n about his views on affirmative action. Is Harvard doing to Asians in the 21st \ncentury what it did to Jews in the 20th? \u201cHarvard\u2019s gonna Harvard,\u201d he said. He \ntold me that he himself was rejected from the school \u2014 he wound up at Brown \u2014 \nthough he was amply qualified. But \u201cif you have any kind of perspective,\u201d he \nsaid, you realize that \u201cmy life and my humanity depends on more than whether \nsome institution decides to stamp my hand.\u201d \u201cArguing for higher representation \nof an already overrepresented group \u2014 at least according to population standards\n \u2014 would not be my first bone to pick,\u201d he said. Instead, he asked why Harvard, \na university with a $40 billion endowment, is \u201copening locations in Shanghai but\n not Ohio or Michigan.\u201d The real question, he said, is, \u201cAre you trying to \nadvance our society or are you trying to advance global moneyed interests?\u201d On \nNew Year\u2019s Eve it occurred to me that, despite living in New York, which prides \nitself on being the most cosmopolitan city in the world, I had not been in a \nroom with such a politically diverse group of people since Donald Trump was \nelected president. If there is a typical Yang voter it is a former Bernie \nSanders supporter who feels that Mr. Yang understands the challenges of the 21st\n century better than a 78-year-old socialist without a single app on his phone. \nMr. Yang supported Mr. Sanders in 2016, before voting for Hillary Clinton in the\n general election (\u201cI\u2019m pro-civilization,\u201d he said). He understands why young \nvoters are drawn to Mr. Sanders. \u201cIf you\u2019re a young person you look up and say, \n\u2018What have I experienced from this capitalist system?\u2019 Corporate abuse, crashes,\n bailouts, greed, record levels of college debt.\u201d But he insists the best actor \nto improve people\u2019s lives is \u201cnot our government, it\u2019s us.\u201d \u201cBernie\u2019s saying, \n\u2018Let\u2019s stick it to the billionaires and all will be well,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m \nsaying, \u2018We need to rewrite the code, we need to rewrite the software.\u2019\u201d At a \ncampaign stop in Manchester, N.H., I spoke with Sunny Payne, a 23-year-old Yang \nsupporter who\u2019d come in from Bangor, Me., and uses the pronoun they. \u201cWhile I \nthink Bernie Sanders is an amazing person,\u201d they said, \u201che has had the exact \nsame policy stances for literally decades.\u201d Amberly McCabe and Martin Raucher, \nboth 29, are also former Sanders supporters. They drove 25 hours from St. \nPetersburg, Fla., and made sure not to cut anyone off on the highway, Ms. McCabe\n said, because there\u2019s a Yang bumper sticker on their car and \u201cwe have to \nrepresent.\u201d Mr. Raucher is a disabled veteran and Ms. McCabe is an artist; they \nmet through their passion: spinning fire. It wasn\u2019t possible to twirl lit \ntorches inside the party room, so Ms. McCabe had fashioned the next best thing: \na handmade light-up Yang sign. \u201cWith Yang I\u2019m all about the ideas, the \npolicies,\u201d she said, above all, his proposal for a universal basic income of \n$1,000 a month. \u201cI need an oil change,\u201d said Mr. Raucher, when I asked how \nthey\u2019d spend it. \u201cAnd my roof is leaking.\u201d Just across the dance floor were \nElasa and Russell Peterson, two former Trump voters who changed their \nregistration \u2014 and moved states \u2014 to support Mr. Yang\u2019s candidacy. \u201cEveryone I \nknow is the broke-folk vote,\u201d said Mr. Peterson. They are among them. Until \nrecently they worked at a North Carolina Olive Garden. (\u201cI got to where I hated \nbreadsticks,\u201d said Ms. Peterson.) \u201cDonald Trump stands up there and says, \u2018Hey, \nwe got to build the wall because the immigrants are coming over here and they\u2019re\n stealing our jobs.\u2019 And you know what? Because we\u2019re all broke we\u2019re all like: \n\u2018It\u2019s immigrants! Yeah! Let\u2019s build the wall!\u2019\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cBut then you\n hear Andrew Yang talk and he\u2019s like, \u2018You know what? It\u2019s not immigrants. It\u2019s \nautomation.\u2019 You go into Walmart, you don\u2019t see immigrants. You see self-serve \ncheckouts. It\u2019s like a light bulb goes off. Like, \u2018Wow, this makes sense.\u2019\u201d It \nmade so much sense that they moved in with Ms. Peterson\u2019s sister in Vermont, 10 \nminutes from the New Hampshire border, so they could volunteer full time for the\n campaign and promote him on their YouTube channel. \u201cEverybody in our family has\n been Yanged. And they were all Trumpers,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. At a town hall \nevent attended by some 300 people on New Year\u2019s Day, the first question \u2014 so on-\nbrand I almost assumed it was a plant \u2014 was about the metric system: \u201cSo, Mr. \nMake Americans Think Harder, can we count on President Yang to support the \nblessings of the metric system?\u201d The crowd laughed. Amazingly, Mr. Yang came \nback with a thoughtful answer about how the metric system is safer, not least \nbecause it is more accurate for micro-dosing baby medicine. To hear Andrew Yang \ntalk is to understand why it is possible for people like the Petersons to \nsupport him: Unlike the president, he never demonizes other Americans. \u201cThe \ndifferences between us are pretty trivial compared to the things we share in \ncommon. And that\u2019s a fundamental message of the campaign: Able-bodied, special \nneeds, white, black, old, young, rural, urban, we\u2019re all going to get run over \nby this automation freight train,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to human up and stop \nfocusing on relatively trivial distinctions.\u201d The villain is not Donald Trump, \nbut a market rigged for Big Tech and against normal Americans. In Mr. Yang\u2019s \nframing of the 2016 election, Mrs. Clinton lost not because of the Electoral \nCollege or Russian bots, but because she fundamentally misunderstood the crisis \nfacing America. \u201cDonald Trump said he was going to make America great again. And\n what did Hillary Clinton say in response? America is already great,\u201d Mr. Yang \nsaid. \u201cThat message did not work because the pain in our country is real.\u201d In \nother words: Donald Trump is the wrong answer to the right question. Mr. Yang \nbelieves he is the right one. At each one of the four campaign stops I went to, \nhe asked the crowd why President Trump won. The audience called out answers: The\n media. Russia. Racism. Hillary. Facebook. Twitter. James Comey. No, said Mr. \nYang. It\u2019s because \u201cwe blasted away four million manufacturing jobs\u201d through \nautomation in states like Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Missouri and Iowa. What \nhappened to manufacturing is coming to retail, restaurants and even accounting \nand the law, Mr. Yang insists. While Mr. Sanders suggests a federal government \njob guarantee, and Joe Biden suggests turning coal miners into coders, Mr. Yang \nsays that work as we have known it is over. If we don\u2019t change anything, I asked\n him, where will be 50 years from now? Best-case scenario? \u201cWe will see \ninequality at a staggering scale that right now most Americans would find \nunthinkable.\u201d And in the worst case? \u201cThe collapse of the government in its \ncurrent form, political break up, and societal dysfunction that results in mass \nriots and violence.\u201d It\u2019s impressive that, for the most part, his good humor \nsoftens the bleak message he is conveying. It\u2019s a vision of the future \u2014 one \ndisputed as hysterical by many observers \u2014 that makes President Trump\u2019s \n\u201cAmerican carnage\u201d address look almost rosy by comparison. I caught up with \nSunny Payne this week. Hearing Mr. Yang in person \u201clit the fire under me,\u201d they \nsaid as they drove around Anderson, S.C., after a day spent door-knocking for \nhim. They\u2019d just spent a week in Iowa before realizing that \u201cI wanted to spread \nthe message to black voters and communities of color and I realized the best \nplace for me to do that was in South Carolina.\u201d They said they kept hearing the \nsame story from voters: \u201cI can\u2019t care about climate change because I need to put\n food on the table. I have three jobs. I barely sleep.\u201d To these people, Sunny \nPayne said, $1,000 a month would be life-changing. That\u2019s the reason that the \ncomedian Dave Chappelle has endorsed Mr. Yang. \u201cThe wealth disparity between me \nand my neighbors is immense; it\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d said Mr. Chappelle, who lives \nin Ohio, but appeared alongside Mr. Yang on the campaign trail this week. \u201cIf \nyou know a third of the people up the street can\u2019t buy groceries, then you start\n to feel an imperative concern,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is without irony or a punch \nline, I\u2019m just telling you \u2014 this guy\u2019s got some great ideas, you should check \nit out.\u201d So have I been Yanged? I don\u2019t know if a universal basic income is the \nbest solution to the problem of inequality. I\u2019m not particularly passionate \nabout lowering the voting age to 16 or requiring police officers to get purple \nbelts in jujitsu. I worry about whether someone with zero foreign policy \nexperience can be the commander in chief. But as Bernie Sanders sells class \nrage, Joe Biden promises normalcy and Elizabeth Warren pushes a social \nprogressivism so perfectly doctrinaire it seems tailored for five kids at \nOberlin, Andrew Yang\u2019s cheerful iconoclasm is refreshing. If getting Yanged \nmeans that I believe that this curious campaign is a cause for that rarest thing\n in current American politics \u2014 hope \u2014 and that Mr. Yang is modeling how to \nharness the populist energy that otherwise threatens to tear us apart, then \ncount me #YangGang.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by What\u2019s Impeachable? They\u2019ll Know It When They See It \nMichelle Cottle, on the ground in Washington, responds to questions about the \nimpeachment trial. By Michelle Cottle Ms. Cottle is a member of the editorial \nboard. After more than a week of statements, petitions, arguments and questions,\n we asked Michelle Cottle, an editorial board member who\u2019s been chronicling \nPresident Trump\u2019s impeachment trial for Opinion each day from Capitol Hill, to \noffer some much-needed clarity. Below are Ms. Cottle\u2019s responses to a selection \nof questions from readers about the proceedings. They have been edited for \nlength and clarity. \u2014 Rachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak, senior editorial \nassistants Proof may not be enough Michael S. Freeman, Narberth, Pa.: There seem\n to be several Republican senators who don\u2019t agree with the analysis of Alan \nDershowitz (a lawyer for President Trump) yet insist that what Mr. Trump is \naccused of is not impeachable. Have any of those senators offered a view of what\n would be an impeachable act? In the absence of clarity from the language in \nArticle 2 of the Constitution, how does any politician decide what is the \nthreshold? Michelle Cottle: Shorter answer: It all depends. The question of what\n constitutes an impeachable offense has been one of the central points of debate\n in this whole mess. Senators can talk about how this or that behavior clearly \ndoes \u2014 or does not \u2014 clear the bar, but to a large degree their views on \nimpeachable offenses boil down to something akin to the old definition of \npornography: They know it when they see it. And the way they see it has much to \ndo with their political team. The House managers nodded to this during their \nopening arguments last week when they played a 1999 video clip of Senator \nLindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and one of the president\u2019s chief \ndefenders, sharing his view of impeachable offenses during the Clinton \nimpeachment trial: \u201cWhat\u2019s a high crime? How about if an important person hurts \nsomebody of low means. It\u2019s not very scholarly, but I think it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Mr.\n Graham says in the clip. \u201cI think that\u2019s what they meant by \u2018high crimes.\u2019 \nDoesn\u2019t have to be a crime. It\u2019s just when you start using your office and \nyou\u2019re acting in a way that hurts people, you\u2019ve committed a high crime.\u201d \nNeedless to say, Mr. Graham no longer believes what he said \u2014 although, to be \nfair it\u2019s hard to know for certain what he believes. In the early stages of the \nTrump impeachment investigation, he said that evidence of a quid pro quo would \nbe cause for concern. As that evidence has emerged, he has changed his tune. \nRepublican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and John Kennedy of Louisiana have both \nsuggested that proving a quid pro quo is not enough, and that the real test \nshould be whether the president\u2019s intentions were corrupt. They obviously do not\n agree that the House managers have made this case. What\u2019s obstruction, anyway? \nGail Mangham, Prescott, Ariz.: I\u2019m trying to square my view \u2014 that the refusal \nof the Republicans to allow witnesses is a form of obstruction of justice \u2014 with\n the Republican view that Trump\u2019s decision to disallow witnesses, like John \nBolton and others, is not obstruction of justice. Need some help on this point. \nMC: You and me both. The defense\u2019s claim is all about process. They insist the \nHouse did such an unfair, slapdash job with its inquiry that the entire \nimpeachment, including many of the subpoenas it issued, were illegitimate and, \nas such, the president would have been irresponsible to participate. \nFurthermore, they argue, if the Senate now validates the House\u2019s shoddy work, it\n will set a terrible precedent, making it too easy for the House to impeach \nfuture presidents. It would be easier to take the defense\u2019s process objections \nmore seriously if many of them weren\u2019t misleading or flat-out dishonest. What is\n the chief justice doing there? Darrie Ganzhorn, Santa Cruz, Calif.: What is \nChief Justice John Roberts\u2019s role and responsibility in this trial? Does he have\n any say in whether there will be witnesses? MC: As presiding officer, the chief\n justice has spent most of his days keeping the process on track \u2014 gaveling \nsessions in and out and preventing partisan spats from getting out of hand. At \none point late in the first trial session, he scolded the House managers and the\n president\u2019s team for excessive jerkiness. During the question-and-answer \nperiod, he read the questions aloud and gently tried to keep the teams of \nlawyers within the five-minute time limit for answers. Eager to avoid the \nappearance of partisanship, the chief justice has avoided wading into the \ncontent of the arguments, declining to push back on even outrageous legal claims\n being floated. (And Mr. Dershowitz has floated some doozies for the defense.) \nHe did take a stand against outing the whistle-blower, refusing to read aloud \nany questions that cited the individual by name. Much as the vice president does\n during normal sessions of the Senate, the chief justice is also there to serve \nas the deciding vote in case of a tie. This may or may not apply to a vote on \nwitnesses, as there is some dispute about whether the chief justice should break\n ties on procedural motions. Rick Bissonnette, Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio: If \nimpeachment managers petition Justice Roberts for a witness and he grants their \npetition, can the Senate overrule that decision with a simple majority? MC: As \nwith so much about impeachment, this too is a matter of dispute. Three legal \nscholars argued in The Times this week that the chief justice can unilaterally \ncall witnesses, based in part on the latest (1986) version of impeachment rules \nand regulations. The chief justice could reject this interpretation, which would\n likely lead to minor chaos as the Senate parliamentarian and others got sucked \ninto the discussion. But! Even if the chief justice did unilaterally subpoena \nJohn Bolton or others, the Senate could still refuse to hear the testimony. \nResult? More chaos. Clash of the executive and legislative Mike Roche, Califon, \nN.J.: Has the Government Accountability Office\u2019s conclusion been introduced into\n the proceedings? MC: The report from the G.A.O. (Congress\u2019s accounting \nwatchdog) has made an appearance, though it has not been discussed in detail. It\n was cited in the trial memorandum that the House impeachment investigators \nsubmitted, and Representative Adam Schiff mentioned it more than once in the \nHouse managers\u2019 opening arguments. Robert Ray, part of the president\u2019s defense \nteam, dismissed it as just another political clash between the executive and \nlegislative branches. For the president, \u2018everything is personal\u2019 Richard L. \nThomas, Los Angeles: Why does the White House accuse Democrats of trying to \n\u201cundo\u201d the 2016 election? If Trump were actually to be convicted in the Senate \ntrial, what, if anything, would happen, other than Vice President Mike Pence, \nwhom Trump\u2019s supporters also voted for, becoming president. MC: Going back to \nthe Mueller investigation and even earlier, the goal of the president and his \ndefenders has been to portray any criticism or questioning of his behavior as \npolitically motivated. As Mr. Trump tells it, Democrats, the media and elements \nof the Deep State are so bitter that he won in 2016 that they\u2019ve all joined \nforces to end his presidency by any means necessary. For him, everything is \npersonal. His argument doesn\u2019t require proof. It just has to inflame partisan \ntensions. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the \neditor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Bernie Sanders Can\u2019t Win Class loathing feels so \ngood, but it is ultimately self-defeating. By Timothy Egan Contributing Opinion \nWriter Watching \u201cSuccession,\u201d the HBO show about the most despicable plutocrats \nto seize the public imagination since the Trumps were forced on us, made me want\n to tax the ultrarich into a homeless shelter. And it almost made a Bernie Bro \nof me. That\u2019s the thing about class loathing: It feels good, a moral high with \nits own endorphins, but is ultimately self-defeating. A Bernie Sanders rally is \na hit from the same pipe: Screw those greedy billionaire bastards! Sanders has \npassion going for him. He has authenticity. He certainly has consistency: His \nbumper-sticker sloganeering hasn\u2019t changed for half a century. He was, \u201ceven as \na young man, an old man,\u201d as Time magazine said. But he cannot beat Donald \nTrump, for the same reason people do not translate their hatred of the odious \nrich into pitchfork brigades against walled estates. The United States has never\n been a socialist country, even when it most likely should have been one, during\n the robber baron tyranny of the Gilded Age or the desperation of the Great \nDepression, and it never will be. Which isn\u2019t to say that American capitalism is\n working; it needs Teddy Roosevelt-style trustbusting and restructuring. We\u2019re \ncoming for you, Facebook. The next month presents the last chance for serious \nscrutiny of Sanders, who is leading in both Iowa and New Hampshire. After that, \nRepublicans will rip the bark off him. When they\u2019re done, you will not recognize\n the aging, mouth-frothing, business-destroying commie from Ben and Jerry\u2019s \ndystopian dairy. Demagogy is what Republicans do best. And Sanders is ripe for \ncaricature. I\u2019m not worried about the Russian stuff \u2014 Bernie\u2019s self-described \n\u201cvery strange honeymoon\u201d to the totalitarian hell of the Soviet Union in 1988, \nand his kind words for similar regimes. Compared with a president who is a \nwilling stooge for the Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, a little vodka-induced \ndancing with the red bear is peanuts. Nor am I worried about the legitimate \nquestions concerning the candidate\u2019s wife, Jane Sanders, who ran a Vermont \ncollege into the ground. Again, Trump\u2019s family of grifters \u2014 from Ivanka \nsecuring her patents from China while Daddy made other promises to Beijing, to \nDon Jr.\u2019s using the White House to leverage the family brand \u2014 give Democrats \nmore than enough ammunition to return the fire. Trump bragged about sexual \nassault, paid off a porn star and ran a fraudulent university. He sucks up to \ndictators and tells a half-dozen lies before he puts his socks on in the \nmorning. A weird column about a rape fantasy from 1972 is not going to sink \nBernie when Trump has debased all public discourse. No, what will get the Trump \ndemagogue factory working at full throttle is the central message of the Sanders\n campaign: that the United States needs a political revolution. It may very well\n need one. But most people don\u2019t think so, as Barack Obama has argued. And \ngetting two million new progressive votes in the usual area codes is not going \nto change that. Give Sanders credit for moving public opinion along on a living \nwage, higher taxes on the rich and the need for immediate action to stem the \nimmolation of the planet. Most great ideas start on the fringe and move to the \nmiddle. But some of his other ideas are stillborn, or never get beyond the \nfringe. Socialism, despite its flavor-of-the-month appeal to young people, is \nnot popular with the general public. Just 39 percent of Americans view socialism\n positively, a bare uptick from 2010, compared with 87 percent who have a \npositive view of free enterprise, Gallup found last fall. What\u2019s more, American \nconfidence in the economy is now at the highest level in nearly two decades. \nThat\u2019s hardly the best condition for overthrowing the system. So-called Medicare\n for all, once people understand that it involves eliminating all private \ninsurance, polls at barely above 40 percent in some surveys, versus the 70 \npercent who favor the option of Medicare for all who want it. Other polls show \nmajority support. But cost is a huge concern. And even Sanders cannot give a \nprice tag for nationalizing more than one-sixth of the economy. A ban on \nfracking is a poison pill in a must-win state like Pennsylvania, which Democrats\n lost by just over 44,000 votes in 2016. Eliminating Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, another Sanders plan, is hugely unpopular with the general public. \nSanders is a rigid man, and he projects grumpy-old-man rigidity, with his policy\n prescriptions frozen in failed Marxist pipe dreams. He\u2019s unlikely to change. I \nsort of like that about his character, in the same way I like that he didn\u2019t \ncave to the politically correct bullies who went after him for accepting the \nsupport of the influential podcaster Joe Rogan. Democrats win with broad-vision \noptimists who still shake up the system \u2014 Franklin Roosevelt, of course, but \nalso Obama. The D\u2019s flipped 40 House seats in 2018 without using any of \nSanders\u2019s stringent medicine. If they stick to that elixir they\u2019ll oust Trump, \nthe goal of a majority of Americans. Democrats lose with fire-and-brimstone \nfundamentalists. Three times, the party nominated William Jennings Bryan, the \nquirky progressive with great oratorical pipes, and three times they were \ntrounced. Look him up, kids. Your grandchildren will do a similar search for \nBernie Sanders when they wonder how Donald Trump won a second term. The Times is\n committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

O.K., we don\u2019t \nreally need to say that. Feels as if all eyes have been on Iowa forever. Right \nnow, the little state in the middle of the country has more political punch than\n the United States Senate. Plus no Mitch McConnell. What more can you ask? The \nquadrennial ritual known as the Iowa caucuses is here. On Monday, Democratic \nvoters will march off to a local gym or school auditorium or hotel ballroom and \ndo their thing. When the results are announced, one or two candidates will be \npropelled into semiofficial front-runner status. One or two others will survive \nto trudge again through New Hampshire. Eight or nine will be gone for good. They\n won\u2019t all admit it, of course. But we\u2019ll know. We\u2019ve now gotten to the point, \nwhich comes in almost every story about the Iowa caucuses, when it\u2019s time to \ncomplain about the system that gives one smallish, rather homogeneous state so \nmuch political clout. Most of us live in non-first places where the candidates \nare spotted mainly at fund-raising events. But you get the impression a lot of \npeople in Cedar Rapids not only get to shake hands with all their favorites; \nthey expect a positive response when they invite them over for dinner.

It started back in the 1970s, when the Democratic \ncandidate-picking system moved from the party leaders to the regular voters. \nIowa wound up going first and really enjoyed the attention. It\u2019s going to keep \nthat spot even if it has to start holding the caucuses in August. \u201cWe take this \nvery seriously,\u201d said Troy Price, the state Democratic Party chairman, in a \nphone interview. For sure. You\u2019d think some Iowans would get a little weary of \nbeing ambushed by candidates every time they go to the store and spending their \nevenings being barraged with political ads on TV and the web. But if they are, \nthey don\u2019t tend to admit it. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want a front-row seat? My mother is \ngoing to be 94 in two months, and she\u2019s going to her first caucus Monday night,\u201d\n Al Setka, the communications manager for the city of Des Moines, told me. \u201cAmy \nKlobuchar announced this afternoon she\u2019d be doing an event in Council Bluffs. \nFive hours later, she filled the room,\u201d Price reported. He had just looked at \nthe schedule for the final Saturday of the campaign and discovered candidates \nappearing in at least 17 different events. (\u201cPlus you have surrogates, and some \ncandidates haven\u2019t even announced their schedules yet.\u201d) The biggest question \nIowans are going to answer is whether the Bernie boom is real. Lately all around\n the country, Democrats have been wandering around looking at polls and \nmuttering: \u201cWow, it looks like our nominee is maybe going to be \u2014 Sanders. Um, \ngee.\u201d Unless, of course, they are part of the extremely large Bernie fan club, \nin which case they\u2019re just bouncing up and down, waiting for their big moment. \n\u201cBernie Sanders could be the nominee,\u201d warned Pete Buttigieg in a fund-raising \nmessage to his supporters that made it clear he did not regard this as a good \nplan. Joe Biden, who some polls place as the front-runner by an itty-bitty \nmargin, claimed the Sanders camp was trying to hurt him by releasing a video \ndistorting his position on Social Security. (Memo to Iowans: Don\u2019t worry about \nSocial Security. Really, no Democrat\u2019s gonna touch it.) What\u2019s the secret of the\n Bernie bounce? Well, these days voters seem to be looking for candidates who \nare \u2014 real. And whatever you think of Sanders, it\u2019s hard to imagine that a \npolitician who cared only about his image would decide to become a cranky-\nlooking white-haired guy who shouts a lot. Donald Trump seems to have noticed \nthe Sanders surge. The senator from Vermont was the first candidate Trump \ninsulted during his standard-issue rally this week in New Jersey (\u201ccrazy Bernie \nSanders\u201d) and the only one who came up more than once. Elizabeth Warren got a \nsingle \u201cPocahontas\u201d and \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d Biden didn\u2019t rate a mention. Sanders, 78, \nhas been finding support in lots of unexpected places \u2014 at least unexpected if \nyou presume voters are drawn to candidates who are like them. He came in first \nin a Forbes-Zogby poll of voters under 30. Meanwhile, things have been looking \nnot-great for Warren, whose poll numbers keep slipping while people keep \ngrumbling that she\u2019s unelectable since voters \u2014 not them of course! Other \nvoters! \u2014 just aren\u2019t going to pick a woman. Warren herself recently claimed \nthat Sanders had told her a woman couldn\u2019t beat Donald Trump. This was allegedly\n during a conversation in 2018 and it was sort of strange she hadn\u2019t mentioned \nit earlier in the campaign. The two of them had an impressive live-on-TV fight \nabout the matter after the last debate. Doubts about whether a woman can win the\n presidency aren\u2019t confined to one sex. A CNN survey found about 20 percent of \nwomen were dubious, compared with 9 percent of men. (It\u2019s possible, of course, \nthat men are more reluctant to be negative on the subject when they\u2019re talking \nto a stranger doing a telephone survey.) \u201cAh, the drumbeat of the electability \nquestion,\u201d sighed Deborah Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women \nand Politics at Rutgers University. Public arguments about whether voters will \nsupport a female presidential candidate, Walsh said, \u201cbecome a self-fulfilling \nprophecy.\u201d Women have, of course, made terrific inroads in American politics. \nTheir representation in Congress keeps climbing. But there are only nine female \ngovernors. You have to wonder if voters feel more comfortable putting women in \nthe legislatures (works well with others) than in executive posts (takes \ncommand). We\u2019ll let Iowa have the next word. Seems like a good spot for a 2020 \ntest run, since the state recently elected its first woman governor and sent two\n women to the House for the first time. Iowa also has a woman senator, Joni \nErnst. Given that Iowa has only four House members (told you it was small), that\n means half the state\u2019s congressional delegation is female. So, glad to have you\n in charge, Iowa. If some smallish, rather homogeneous state had to be given the\n privilege of starting the Democratic presidential selection process every \nsingle time, you seem like an excellent choice. Democrats who aren\u2019t fans of \nputting Iowa at the perpetual start often point out that it leads to a whole lot\n of pandering to the corn lobby. And it\u2019s true that if you\u2019ve listened to \ncampaign speeches in Iowa over the years, you\u2019ve heard a lot about the glories \nof ethanol. That\u2019s the corn-based biofuel the government requires be laced into \ngasoline in the name of conservation. The ethanol endorsement was as much of a \nritual of Iowa campaigning as the visit to the butter sculptures at the state \nfair. Even Bernie Sanders bought into it in 2016, although many \nenvironmentalists believe it actually increases global warming. Sanders doesn\u2019t \nseem to have retracted his stance, although he\u2019s also signed onto the Green New \nDeal, which is anti-ethanol. And almost nobody is demanding that he straighten \nhis position out. \u201cIt\u2019s just not getting much time,\u201d said Scott Faber of the \nEnvironmental Working Group. Maybe, Faber theorized, farmers are too busy \nworrying about a trade war to obsess over anything else. Whatever the subtext, \nit\u2019s a change. None of the candidates even bothered to attend the Iowa biofuels \nsummit in January. We appear to be living in a post-ethanol-pander world. While \nIowans are very attached to the caucus tradition, most don\u2019t actually show up to\n vote \u2014 only a little over a quarter of the registered Democrats took part in \nBernie versus Hillary four years ago. And as of now, even many dedicated \ncaucusgoers haven\u2019t totally decided who they\u2019ll vote for. That\u2019s partly because \nthere are so many options. \u201cTypically by now we see it whittled down to three \nfolks,\u201d said Price, the party chairman. \u201cThis year we still have six or seven or\n eight active campaigns.\u201d The caucuses are very, very different from your normal\n go-into-the-booth-and-vote election. Democrats gather in 1,678 precinct \nlocations, then split into groups for each candidate. If your person doesn\u2019t get\n 15 percent on the first round you\u2019re supposed to join another group for the \nsecond head count. Besides making international headlines, the final result will\n tell us how Iowa will be dividing its delegation to the presidential \nconvention, which will be casting approximately 1 percent of the total votes. In\n 2016, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders basically tied \u2014 she won with 49.9 \npercent of the vote to his 49.6 percent. Sanders then went on to beat the socks \noff Clinton in New Hampshire, and continue an increasingly hopeless battle right\n onto the convention floor. The memory of that trauma may have been what \ninspired Clinton to recently tell a reporter that \u201cnobody likes him.\u201d On the \nground, the candidates have been diligently trying to look as if they\u2019re living \nin Iowa forever, though none has actually gone so far as to buy a house \u2014 or \ntransfer kids to Iowa public schools, as one hopeful did in the 2008 cycle. \n(That was then-senator Chris Dodd, and he came in sixth.) Elizabeth Warren has \nbeen holding a mind-boggling number of private meetings, selfie-takings, and \nother one-on-ones. But as much as the meet-in-person mantra rules in Iowa, it\u2019s \nclearly not all you need to win. The candidate who held the most events in the \nstate this campaign season was \u2026 John Delaney. Followed by Amy Klobuchar and \nAndrew Yang. The impeachment drama has been keeping Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar \nand Michael Bennet in Washington when they\u2019d much rather be out at a \nkaffeeklatsch in Iowa City. And distracting a lot of the national attention that\n would otherwise have been boring down on the Democrats. Ernst, the Republican \nsenator, tried to mix the two by wondering how the controversy over Hunter \nBiden\u2019s big-bucks job in Ukraine would influence the caucusgoers. (\u201cWill they be\n supporting Vice President Biden at this point?\u201d) The Biden camp quickly sent \nout a fund-raising email headed, \u201cHey Senator Joni Ernst, Let Me Answer Your \nQuestion Directly.\u201d It got points for speediness, but some of us were \ndisappointed by the failure to mention that this is the woman who got her start \nbragging about her talent for pig castration. As strange as the caucus system \nis, Iowa really does have its pluses as the national starting gun. The voters \nwho take part truly are very diligent. And the experience of walking around some\n very cold shopping malls in Des Moines gives the candidates excellent \npreparation for walking around some very cold shopping malls in Manchester, N.H.\n On we go until the Democrats nominate someone to run against Donald Trump. Then\n it\u2019s time for the final election, when we can get back to complaining that \nnobody visits us \u2014 in the general election in 2016, two-thirds of the campaign \nevents were held in six states: Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, \nVirginia and Michigan. We\u2019ll be cranky again soon enough. But we\u2019ll always have \nIowa.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by George Soros: Mark Zuckerberg Should Not Be in \nControl of Facebook The social media company is going to get Trump re-elected \u2014 \nbecause it\u2019s good for business. By George Soros Mr. Soros is a philanthropist. \nAt a dinner last week in Davos, Switzerland, I was asked if I thought Facebook \nwas behaving more responsibly today than it did during the 2016 presidential \nelection. \u201cNot at all,\u201d I answered. \u201cFacebook helped Trump to get elected and I \nam afraid that it will do the same in 2020.\u201d I explained that there is a \nlongstanding law \u2014 Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 that protects\n social media platforms from legal liability for defamation and similar claims. \nFacebook can post deliberately misleading or false statements by candidates for \npublic office and others, and take no responsibility for them. I went on to say \nthat there appears to be \u201can informal mutual assistance operation or agreement \ndeveloping between Trump and Facebook\u201d in which Facebook will help President \nTrump to get re-elected and Mr. Trump will, in turn, defend Facebook against \nattacks from regulators and the media. \u201cThis is just plain wrong,\u201d a Facebook \nspokesman told Business Insider. I disagree. I believe that Mr. Trump and \nFacebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, realize that their interests are \naligned \u2014 the president\u2019s in winning elections, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s in making \nmoney. Let\u2019s look at the evidence: In 2016, Facebook provided the Trump campaign\n with embedded staff who helped to optimize its advertising program. (Hillary \nClinton\u2019s campaign was also approached, but it declined to embed a Facebook team\n in her campaign\u2019s operations.) Brad Parscale, the digital director of Mr. \nTrump\u2019s 2016 campaign and now his campaign manager for 2020, said that Facebook \nhelped Mr. Trump and gave him the edge. This seems to have marked the beginning \nof a special relationship. More recently, direct contact between the two men has\n raised serious questions. Mr. Zuckerberg met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office \non Sept. 19, 2019. We don\u2019t know what was said. But from an interview on the \nsidelines at the World Economic Forum on Jan. 22, we do know what Mr. Trump said\n about the meeting: Mr. Zuckerberg \u201ctold me that I\u2019m No. 1 in the world in \nFacebook.\u201d Mr. Trump apparently had no problem with Facebook\u2019s decision not to \nfact-check political ads. \u201cI\u2019d rather have him just do whatever he is going to \ndo,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Zuckerberg. \u201cHe\u2019s done a hell of a job, when you \nthink of it.\u201d The president\u2019s 2016 campaign mounted a robust data-centric \ncommunications effort and has continued to build on that program over the past \nfew years, using Facebook as a key part of their strategy. Facebook\u2019s decision \nnot to require fact-checking for political candidates\u2019 advertising in 2020 has \nflung open the door for false, manipulated, extreme and incendiary statements. \nSuch content is rewarded with prime placement and promotion if it meets \nFacebook-designed algorithmic standards for popularity and engagement. What\u2019s \nmore, Facebook\u2019s design tends to obscure the sources of inflammatory and false \ncontent, and fails to adequately punish those who spread false information. Nor \ndoes the company effectively warn those who are exposed to lies. I expressed my \nfear that with Facebook\u2019s help, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election. The recent\n hiring of a right-wing figure to help manage its news tab has reinforced those \nfears. In my comments in Davos, I also pointed out that Facebook has been used \nto cause worse damage in other countries than the United States. In Myanmar, for\n example, military personnel used Facebook to help incite the public against the\n Rohingya, who were targeted in a military assault of incredible cruelty \nincluding murder, rape and the burning of entire villages: Around 700,000 \nRohingya fled to Bangladesh. The International Court of Justice in The Hague is \ncurrently deliberating whether these atrocities qualify as genocide. But within \nthe last year, Facebook has introduced new features on its mobile app that \nactually intensify the fire of incendiary political attacks \u2014 making them easier\n and quicker to propagate. The system is cost-free to the poster and revenue-\ngenerating for Facebook. Good for Facebook, bad for democracy. The responsible \napproach is self-evident. Facebook is a publisher not just a neutral moderator \nor \u201cplatform.\u201d It should be held accountable for the content that appears on its\n site. Speaking at a cocktail party in Davos on Jan. 22, Facebook\u2019s chief \noperating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, repeated the worn Silicon Valley clich\u00e9 that\n Facebook is trying to make the world a better place. But Facebook should be \njudged by what it does, not what it says. I repeat and reaffirm my accusation \nagainst Facebook under the leadership of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg. They \nfollow only one guiding principle: maximize profits irrespective of the \nconsequences. One way or another, they should not be left in control of \nFacebook.
