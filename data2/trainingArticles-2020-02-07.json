            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Disappointed by the Oscars? You Are Not Alone Dig \ninto the Spirit Awards instead. By Veronica Walsingham Ms. Walsingham is a \nwriter. This essay has been updated to reflect news developments. Last year, the\n Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded its top prize to \u201cGreen \nBook,\u201d a feel-good period drama about a white man learning to be less racist \nthrough forced interaction with a black man. Immediately, many people called \nthis out as a stain on the Academy\u2019s record, proof voters remain out of touch \nwith the current cultural climate. Many movie lovers, myself included, were \nunderstandably upset and disappointed. In all likelihood you may have forgotten \n\u2014 or may not even have been aware \u2014 that the Film Independent Spirit Awards, \nheld the night before the Oscars, went a very different route. \u201cIf Beale Street \nCould Talk,\u201d a period drama about a black couple torn apart by a racist system, \nwas critically acclaimed for its visuals, Barry Jenkins\u2019s direction and the \nperformances. Despite being set decades in the past, its themes felt \nparticularly relevant and resonant. \u201cBeale Street,\u201d however, wasn\u2019t even \nnominated for best picture at the Oscars. But it was deemed best picture at the \nFilm Independent Spirit Awards. If only we had paid less attention to the Oscars\n and cared more about the Spirit Awards. We should care more about the Spirit \nAwards. Such sharp dissonance between these awards voting bodies isn\u2019t an \naberration. In an alternate universe, this year\u2019s Oscars ceremony would be \ninviting Adam Sandler, Jennifer Lopez and Willem Dafoe as nominees for their \nperformances in \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d \u201cHustlers\u201d and \u201cThe Lighthouse,\u201d to name just a \nfew of the people snubbed, despite numerous accolades. They were each, at least,\n nominated for a Spirit Award on Saturday. (Mr. Sandler and Mr. Dafoe both won.)\n Conceived as the Friends of Independents Awards in 1984, the Spirit Awards have\n diverted from the Academy\u2019s best-picture selection more often than not \u2014 and on\n the whole, history has been much kinder to those Spirit selections. Among the \nmost egregious examples: the best-picture Oscar for \u201cDriving Miss Daisy,\u201d a \ndecision many critics have cited as one of the worst made by the Academy, not \nunlike \u201cGreen Book.\u201d That same year, the Spirit Awards celebrated \u201cSex, Lies, \nand Videotape,\u201d Steven Soderbergh\u2019s impressive debut that has been credited with\n changing the landscape of indie filmmaking. In 1994, the Oscar went to \u201cForrest\n Gump,\u201d a film that has more recently faced criticism for its whitewashed \nversion of United States history and conservative view of women\u2019s sexuality. In \ncontrast, the Spirit Award that year went to \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d a narrative-bending\n film that has become a touchstone in film history. And it\u2019s hard to forget the \ninfamous Oscars upset by the treacly racial reconciliation drama \u201cCrash\u201d over \nthe groundbreaking \u201cBrokeback Mountain.\u201d At least Ang Lee\u2019s tender romance will \nalways have its Spirit Award. The Spirit Awards are, in practice, more akin to \nthe People\u2019s Choice Awards. Despite the Academy\u2019s attempts to diversify its \nmembership in recent years, it still remains an elite and selective voting body,\n some of whom openly admit they haven\u2019t even bothered to see all of the movies \nthat are nominated in a given year. In contrast, membership in the Film \nIndependent nonprofit organization, which includes voting privileges, is open to\n the public; general memberships start at an annual fee of $95. While the Spirit\n Award nominees are determined by a committee of filmmakers, critics and others \nin the industry, the winners are ultimately chosen through the voting body. This\n relative democratization presumably helps undercut many of the socioeconomic \ninfluences entrenched in the Academy Awards, where millions spent on campaigning\n and lobbying can and often do trump any cases to be made for artistic merit. \n(The amount it costs for an A-list actress to get ready to walk the red carpet \nat the Oscars is $10 million alone, according to Forbes.) Spirit Award voters \nmay not be immune from the allure of a public awards season campaign \norchestrated through late-night interviews and flattering profiles. But the lack\n of restrictions by either industry or central location suggests they cannot be \nas easily bought with private dinners, private jets and private concerts, as is \nreportedly custom during awards season. When money and politics are less of a \nfactor, doors can open up for greater representation. The winners of the last \nthree best-director Spirit Awards have been black: Jordan Peele for \u201cGet Out\u201d \nand Barry Jenkins for \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cBeale Street.\u201d Twenty-two women have been\n nominated in this same category, and three \u2014 Sofia Coppola, Martha Coolidge \nand, as a co-director, Valerie Faris \u2014 have won. Those numbers could certainly \nbe higher, but consider that only one woman has won this category in the Oscars\u2019\n 92-year history. (In 2018, more female directors were nominated than men at the\n Spirit Awards. It\u2019s nearly impossible to imagine this happening at the Oscars \nanytime soon.) To be sure, there are some drawbacks. For one, Spirit Award \nnominations are limited to films capped at a certain budget, which as of 2020 is\n $22.5 million. (The Academy imposes no budgetary ceiling, though it does have \nrequirements based on theatrical runs.) This means a big-budget crowd-pleaser \nlike \u201cBlack Panther\u201d has no shot at recognition \u2014 though the inclusion of \nacclaimed franchise films at the Oscars seems more for show (and ratings) than \nanything else; such films rarely win best picture. And admittedly, some of the \nSpirit Award omissions in a given year are baffling to look back on \u2014 no \nnominations for \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d or \u201cThe Big \nLebowski\u201d? Still, these slights pale in comparison with the many times the \nAcademy got it wrong. And year after year we drive ourselves mad \u2014 for what \nreason? I fully recognize that Hollywood performers and creatives are unlikely \nto jump onboard my \u201cforget the Oscars\u201d train anytime soon. Being nominated for \nand, if lucky enough, winning that coveted statuette remains an unparalleled \ncareer booster. But the rest of us could save ourselves a lot of stress and \nheartache by directing our energy and attention elsewhere. Imagine the Academy \nAwards as your bad-for-you significant other: constantly disappointing you, \npromising change, only to under-deliver, celebrating problematic views of the \nworld. I\u2019m here to tell you \u2014 gently, because I\u2019m a good friend \u2014 that perhaps \nyou\u2019re in an unhealthy relationship and it\u2019s time to dump them. I\u2019m here, \ntelling you there are other awards shows in the sea. Veronica Walsingham \n(@veronicaisdrunk) is a freelance arts and culture writer.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Harrowing Chaos of the Democratic Primary Is it \nreally going to be Bernie or bust for American democracy? By Michelle Goldberg \nOpinion Columnist Although I\u2019m a pessimist by nature, deep down I think I always\n believed that the Republic would survive Donald Trump. The majority of \nAmericans have never accepted him, and his ascendancy fueled a nationwide civic \nawakening, starting with the Women\u2019s March and proceeding through airport \nprotests, health care town halls and finally the midterms. It\u2019s been devastating\n to see how quickly so many American institutions have been corrupted \u2014 the \nDepartment of Justice turned into an engine of Trump\u2019s paranoid vendettas, the \nState Department purged of nonpartisan professionals, evidence of Trump\u2019s \nUkraine extortion scheme buried by his Senate lackeys. It\u2019s outrageous that the \ncountry\u2019s being forced to endure four full years of lawless kakistocracy, but \nsurely, I thought, the majority would put an end to it in the next election. But\n now that election is approaching, and the debacle of the Iowa caucuses only \nhighlights how the Democratic Party is threatening to fracture. In its \naftermath, we\u2019re left with a national race led by two very old and \nextraordinarily risky general election candidates whose weaknesses were \nunderscored by Iowa\u2019s results, muddled as they were. Bernie Sanders\u2019s supporters\n have argued that he can expand the electorate to make up for the suburban \nmoderates he\u2019s likely to lose, moderates who were, incidentally, responsible for\n many of the gains Democrats made in 2018. But while Sanders claimed a popular \nvote victory in Iowa, there was no surge in voter turnout since the last \nelection, and an NBC News entrance poll showed that the number of first-time \ncaucusers actually went down. Sanders still has the advantage of energy and \nardor; young people are overwhelmingly on his side, and his campaign will be \ncarried along by the same sort of ebullient cultural ferment as Barack Obama\u2019s. \n(When the pop megastar Ariana Grande met Sanders in November, she wrote on \nTwitter, \u201cI will never smile this hard again.\u201d) I try to talk myself into \nbelieving that his passionate base, combined with a polarized electorate, will \nbe enough. Still, with the survival of American democracy at stake, it seems \nlike a wild gamble for Democrats to turn the fight against Trump into a \nreferendum on Democratic socialism at a time when Americans\u2019 personal economic \nsatisfaction is at a record high. Here\u2019s the place for disclosure: My husband is\n consulting for Elizabeth Warren, the candidate I believe in more than any \nother. But I recognize that Warren has electability challenges of her own, and \nthe truth is I\u2019d be fine with any nominee who could generate enthusiasm without \nscaring suburbanites, if I could only see who that was. I\u2019m not the only one \nfeeling panicked. The recent rush of mayoral endorsements for Michael Bloomberg \nis partly just a function of the money he\u2019s poured into cities through his \nphilanthropic work, but it also indicates a worrying lack of confidence in the \nexisting field. Michael Tubbs, the innovative mayor of Stockton, Calif., who \npioneered a universal basic income experiment in his struggling city, became a \nnational co-chair of Bloomberg\u2019s campaign in December. \u201cEvery candidate at this \nstage of the primary has real serious questions about how they\u2019ll bring the \nparty together after they become the nominee,\u201d he told me. How did it come to \nthis? Mostly, I blame Joe Biden and those in the Democratic establishment who \npushed his campaign. It\u2019s been obvious for some time now that Biden is not \nnearly as vigorous as he once was. While he\u2019s always been gaffe-prone, his \nspeech has grown tentative and meandering in a way that engenders sympathy but \nalso profound anxiety. In Iowa, where voters had a chance to see him up close, \nthe most recent results show him with a distant fourth-place finish. Even if he \nsomehow limps to the nomination, the general election will be a grim slog, like \nracing on a wounded horse. Yet with his unmatched biography and name \nrecognition, he deprived younger center-left candidates like Kamala Harris, Cory\n Booker and Michael Bennet of oxygen even as he failed to consolidate centrists \nhimself. That\u2019s left the erstwhile novelty candidate Pete Buttigieg as Biden\u2019s \nstrongest competitor for moderate votes, but while he\u2019s shooting up the polls in\n New Hampshire, he has virtually no support among voters of color. According to \nthe polling experts at FiveThirtyEight, Sanders now has a 1 in 2 chance of \nwinning the majority of delegates in the Democratic race. The next most likely \nscenario, with 1 in 4 odds, is that no one does, which would spell a contested \nconvention. Should that happen, there will be forces in the Democratic Party \nthat try to block Sanders. (A few members of the Democratic National Committee \nhave already discussed rule changes meant to thwart him, though so far it\u2019s just\n been marginal chatter.) But if Sanders emerges from the primaries with a \nplurality of votes, denying him the nomination would be not just unfair but \npotentially suicidal. I worry about Sanders\u2019s chances against Trump, but a \ncandidate foisted on the party over the furious remonstrances of a disempowered \nbase would almost certainly fare worse, while permanently alienating the young \npeople who should be the Democratic Party\u2019s future. The way things are going, \nthe fate of American democracy could soon be Bernie or bust. I envy those who \nfind that exhilarating rather than terrifying.

But even when we\u2019re not being victimized, the\n alternative leaves much to be desired. Credit...Hokyoung Kim Supported by By \nBrit Marling Ms. Marling is a filmmaker. I moved to Los Angeles to become an \nactress at 24. These are character descriptions of roles I have read for: \u201cthin,\n attractive, Dave\u2019s wife\u201d; \u201crobot girl, a remarkable feat of engineering\u201d; \u201cher \nbreasts are large and she\u2019s wearing a red sweater.\u201d I stuffed my bra for that \nlast one. I still did not get the part. After a while it was hard to tell what \nwas the greater source of my depression: that I could not book a part in a \nhorror film where I had three lines and died on Page 4, or that I was even \nauditioning to play these roles at all. After dozens of auditions and zero \ncallbacks, my mom suggested I get breast implants. From her perspective, I had \nwalked away from a coveted job at Goldman Sachs and chosen a profession of self-\ncommodification. She wanted to help me sell better. But I wasn\u2019t drawn to acting\n because I wanted to be desired. I was drawn to acting because I felt it would \nallow me to become the whole, embodied person I remembered being in childhood \u2014 \none that could imagine freely, listen deeply and feel wholeheartedly. I \ncontinued to audition and continued to fail. My depression deepened. My self-\nesteem plummeted. My boyfriend would get drunk and punch holes in the wall next \nto my head. I let him. He spat in my face. I let him. He dissolved into tears in\n my arms. I let him. And then I sifted through the ashes of his anger and his \nfather\u2019s anger before him to help him uncover the forgiveness he needed to move \non. I was auditioning to be \u201cDave\u2019s wife.\u201d I was \u201crobot girl, a remarkable feat \nof engineering.\u201d After a day of running from men with chain saws in audition \nrooms and a night of running from the man I shared a bed with, I decided I was \ndone auditioning. I felt I had to write my way out of these roles or I wouldn\u2019t \nfind my way in the real world, either. I could not be what I could not see \nonscreen. So I went to the library in downtown Los Angeles and started reading \nbooks and watching films about how to write dramas for the screen. I clung to \nJodie Foster in Jonathan Demme\u2019s \u201cSilence of the Lambs,\u201d to Holly Hunter in Jane\n Campion\u2019s \u201cThe Piano.\u201d But aside from a handful of exceptions, I was \noverwhelmed by the number of dramatic narratives that murdered their female \ncharacters. In \u201cThe Big Heat\u201d she has a pot of boiling coffee thrown in her face\n and is then shot in the back. In \u201cChinatown\u201d the bullet tears through her brain\n and out her eye. And in case this seems like a trend of the past, consider the \nmore recent noir \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d where the holographic femme fatale is \ndeleted and the remaining women are stabbed, drowned and gutted like a fish. \nEven the spirited Antigone, the brave Joan of Arc and the unfettered Thelma and \nLouise meet tragic ends in large part because they are spirited, brave and \nunfettered. They can defy kings, refuse beauty and defend themselves against \nviolence. But it\u2019s challenging for a writer to imagine a world in which such \nfree women can exist without brutal consequences. We live in a world that is a \ndirect reflection of these stories we\u2019ve been telling. Close to four women a day\n are murdered in America at the hands of their partners or former partners. One \nout of every four women in America has been the victim of a rape. I am one of \nthose one out of four. Our narratives tell us that women are objects and objects\n are disposable, so we are always objectified and often disposed of. There are \ncenturies of trial and error inside the \u201chero\u2019s journey,\u201d in which a young man \nis called to adventure, challenged by trials, faces a climactic battle and \nemerges victorious, changed and a hero. And while there are narrative patterns \nfor the adventures of girls \u2014 \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d \u2014 those \nare few and far between, and for adult women, even less so. Even when I found \nmyself writing stories about women rebelling against the patriarchy, it still \nfelt like what I largely ended up describing was the confines of patriarchy. The\n more fettered I felt inside the real world, the more I turned toward science \nfiction, speculative fiction and lo-fi fantasy. I eventually co-wrote, produced \nand starred in two microbudget films, \u201cAnother Earth\u201d and \u201cSound of My Voice.\u201d \nBoth stories left reality just far enough behind to give me the mental freedom \nto imagine female characters behaving in ways not often seen onscreen. I emerged\n from the Sundance Film Festival with offers to act in projects I would never \nhave been allowed to read for a week prior. Most of those roles were still \ngirlfriend, mistress, mother. But there was a new character on offer to me as \nwell, one that survived the story. Enter, stage right: the Strong Female Lead. \nShe\u2019s an assassin, a spy, a soldier, a superhero, a C.E.O. She can make a wound \ncompress out of a maxi pad while on the lam. She\u2019s got MacGyver\u2019s \nresourcefulness but looks better in a tank top. Acting the part of the Strong \nFemale Lead changed both who I was and what I thought I was capable of. Training\n to do my own stunt work made me feel formidable and respected on set. Playing \nscenes where I was the boss firing men tasted like empowerment. And it will \nalways feel better to be holding the gun in the scene than to be pleading for \nyour life at the other end of the barrel. It would be hard to deny that there is\n nutrition to be drawn from any narrative that gives women agency and voice in a\n world where they are most often without both. But the more I acted the Strong \nFemale Lead, the more I became aware of the narrow specificity of the \ncharacters\u2019 strengths \u2014 physical prowess, linear ambition, focused rationality. \nMasculine modalities of power. I thought back to the films I watched and stories\n I read burrowed deep in the stacks of the library. I began to see something \ndeeper and more insidious behind all those images of dead and dying women. When \nwe kill women in our stories, we aren\u2019t just annihilating female gendered \nbodies. We are annihilating the feminine as a force wherever it resides \u2014 in \nwomen, in men, of the natural world. Because what we really mean when we say we \nwant strong female leads is: \u201cGive me a man but in the body of a woman I still \nwant to see naked.\u201d It\u2019s difficult for us to imagine femininity itself \u2014 \nempathy, vulnerability, listening \u2014 as strong. When I look at the world our \nstories have helped us envision and then erect, these are the very qualities \nthat have been vanquished in favor of an overwrought masculinity. I\u2019ve played \nthe Strong Female Lead in real life, too \u2014 as an analyst at an investment bank \nbefore coming to Hollywood. I wore suits, drank Scotch neat and talked about the\n women and the men I was sleeping with like commodities on an open market. I \nburied my feminine intelligence alive in order to survive. I excelled at my \nlinear task of making more money from a lot of money regardless of the long-term\n consequences for others and the environment. The lone female V.P. on my floor \nand my mentor at the time gave me the following advice when she left to partner \nat a hedge fund: Once a week, open the door to your office when they finally \ngive you one, and place a phone call where you shout a string of expletives in a\n threatening voice. She added that there doesn\u2019t actually need to be someone on \nthe other end of the line. I don\u2019t believe the feminine is sublime and the \nmasculine is horrifying. I believe both are valuable, essential, powerful. But \nwe have maligned one, venerated the other, and fallen into exaggerated \nperformances of both that cause harm to all. How do we restore balance? Or how \ndo we evolve beyond the limitations that binaries like feminine/masculine \npresent in the first place?  In 2014 I went back to the library and encountered \nOctavia Butler\u2019s \u201cParable of the Sower,\u201d a sci-fi novel written in 1993 \nimagining a 2020 where society has largely collapsed from climate change and \ngrowing wealth inequality. Butler\u2019s heroine, the 17 year-old Lauren, has \n\u201chyperempathy\u201d \u2014 she feels, quite literally, other people\u2019s pain. This feminine \ngift and curse uniquely prepares her to survive the violent attack on her \ncommunity in Los Angeles and successfully encourage a small tribe north to begin\n again from seeds she has saved from her family\u2019s garden. Butler felt to me like\n a lighthouse blinking from an island of understanding way out at sea. I had no \nidea how to get there, but I knew she had found something life saving. She had \nfound a form of resistance. Butler and other writers like Ursula Le Guin, Toni \nMorrison and Margaret Atwood did not employ speculative fiction to colonize \nother planets, enslave new life-forms, or extract alien minerals for capital \ngains only to have them taken at gunpoint by A.I. robots. These women used the \ntenets of genre to reveal the injustices of the present and imagine our \nevolution. With these ideas in mind, Zal Batmanglij and I wrote and created \u201cThe\n OA,\u201d a Netflix series about Prairie, a blind girl who is kidnapped and returns \nseven years later to the community she grew up in with her sight restored. She \nopens up to a group of lost teenage boys in her neighborhood, telling them about\n her captivity and the inter-dimensional travel she discovered to survive it. It\n turns out these boys need to hear Prairie\u2019s story as much as she needs to tell \nit. For the boys face their own kind of captivity: growing up inside the \nincreasingly toxic obligations of American manhood.  As time has passed, I\u2019ve \ncome to understand what deep influence shaping a narrative has. Stories inspire \nour actions. They frame for us existences that are and are not possible, \ndelineate tracks we can or cannot travel. They choose who we can find empathy \nfor and who we cannot. What we have fellow feeling for, we protect. What we \nobjectify and commodify, we eventually destroy. I don\u2019t want to be the dead \ngirl, or Dave\u2019s wife. But I don\u2019t want to be a strong female lead either, if my \npower is defined largely by violence and domination, conquest and colonization. \nSometimes I get a feeling of what she could be like. A truly free woman. But \nwhen I try to fit her into the hero\u2019s journey she recedes from the picture like \na mirage. She says to me: Brit, the hero\u2019s journey is centuries of narrative \nprecedent written by men to mythologize men. Its pattern is inciting incident, \nrising tension, explosive climax and denouement. What does that remind you of? \nAnd I say, a male orgasm. And she says: Correct. I love the arc of male \npleasure. But how could you bring me into being if I must satisfy the \nchoreography of his desire only? And I say: Good on you. But then how do I bring\n you into being? Then I hear only silence. But even in the silence I dream of \nanswers. I imagine new structures and mythologies born from the choreography of \nfemale bodies, non-gendered bodies, bodies of color, disabled bodies. I imagine \nexcavating my own desires, wants and needs, which I have buried so deeply to \nmeet the desires, wants and needs of men around me that I\u2019m not yet sure how my \nown desire would power the protagonist of a narrative. These are not yet \nsolutions. But they are places to dig. Excavating, teaching and celebrating the \nfeminine through stories is, inside our climate emergency, a matter of human \nsurvival. The moment we start imagining a new world and sharing it with one \nanother through story is the moment that new world may actually come.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Republican Party Has Embraced Its Worst Self \nTrump\u2019s acquittal is a reminder that history doesn\u2019t always move forward. \nReaction and retrenchment often triumph. By Jamelle Bouie Opinion Columnist Most\n Americans have a Whiggish view of their history, in which the story of America \nis one of gradual moral progress and expanding political liberty \u2014 of the nation\n continuously moving toward a more perfect union. It\u2019s a vision President Barack\n Obama evoked in his 2015 speech on the 50th anniversary of \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d in \nSelma, Ala., even as he tied it to work and struggle. \u201cTwo hundred and thirty-\nnine years after this nation\u2019s founding, our union is not yet perfect,\u201d he said.\n \u201cBut we are getting closer.\u201d But there\u2019s an alternative narrative, in which \nprogress is the exception, not the rule \u2014 where it comes at great cost and its \nfull promise is dashed by reaction and backlash. This story is one of flawed \ninstitutions and limited democracy; of a slaveholder\u2019s republic that lasted a \nlittle under three generations before it collapsed into civil war; of Redemption\n after Reconstruction; of Jim Crow autocracy in the midst of widening white \nprosperity. I have been thinking about this story of the country\u2019s history in \nthe context of impeachment. On Wednesday, the Senate voted to acquit President \nTrump of charges levied by the House of Representatives \u2014 abuse of power and \nobstruction of Congress. It\u2019s not that the case wasn\u2019t strong. Several Trump \nallies, like Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, acknowledged the president\u2019s \nwrongdoing. And corroborating revelations from John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former \nnational security adviser, only strengthened the argument against the president.\n In the end, however, just one Republican \u2014 Mitt Romney of Utah \u2014 voted with \nDemocrats to remove Trump from office for abuse of power. Romney\u2019s vote was the \none surprise. Yet for all the condemnation of Senate Republicans \u2014 that they\u2019re \nfearful, craven and \u201cabsolutely cowardly\u201d \u2014 they were acting in character. The \nattempt to extort the Ukrainian president into investigating Joe Biden was, as \nRomney said before he cast his vote, \u201can appalling abuse of the public trust.\u201d \nIt was an assault on the integrity of our elections and our democracy. But there\n have been other assaults on our democracy besides Trump\u2019s attempt to cheat his \nway to re-election. There\u2019s a way in which Trump\u2019s strong-arming of Ukraine \u2014 \nand his acquittal by the Republican Senate majority \u2014 is the capstone to at \nleast a decade of attacks on our democratic system. Seen in that context, \nRepublican politicians are simply playing their usual part, greeting these \nattacks with either indifference, support or outright enthusiasm. In 2010, when \na Republican-appointed majority of the Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v.\n Federal Election Commission against prohibitions on independent political \nexpenditures by corporations, it opened American elections to billions in \nunaccountable spending. It promised to undermine voters and political parties in\n favor of powerful, wealthy interests, tilting the playing field permanently. An\n overwhelming majority of Americans, including most Republican voters, opposed \nthe decision. But Republican lawmakers sang a different tune. \u201cFor too long, \nsome in this country have been deprived of full participation in the political \nprocess,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who was the Senate minority \nleader. \u201cWith today\u2019s monumental decision, the Supreme Court took an important \nstep in the direction of restoring the First Amendment rights of these groups by\n ruling that the Constitution protects their right to express themselves about \npolitical candidates and issues up until Election Day.\u201d Michael Steele, at that \ntime the chairman of the Republican National Committee, agreed. \u201cToday\u2019s \ndecision by the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. F.E.C. serves as an \naffirmation of the constitutional rights provided to Americans under the First \nAmendment,\u201d he said. If Republicans in Washington were enthusiastic about \nCitizens United, they were silent in 2013 after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in \nShelby County v. Holder, where that same Republican-appointed majority gutted a \ncritical section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, clearing the way for new \nrestrictions on voting. Neither McConnell nor the House speaker, John Boehner, \nhad any comment in the wake of the decision, despite the fact that they voted to\n reauthorize the Voting Rights Act seven years earlier, under President George \nW. Bush. Boehner had even called it \u201can effective tool in protecting a right \nthat is fundamental to our democracy.\u201d In 2015, he would effectively kill a \nHouse bill to restore the Voting Rights Act to its former strength. Since \nShelby, Republican lawmakers in states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North \nCarolina and Georgia have openly suppressed the vote with voter purges, strict \nID laws and cuts to voting infrastructure (closing polling places in \npredominantly Democratic areas like college campuses, for example). While this \nhappened, their counterparts in Washington either looked the other way or \nactively denounced efforts to protect the vote. The recent Democratic House bill\n to combat corruption and strengthen voting rights was, McConnell wrote in The \nWashington Post, \u201ca naked attempt to change the rules of American politics to \nbenefit one party.\u201d Let\u2019s return to those rival accounts of United States \nhistory. If the story of the American republic is the story of democratic \ndecline as much as it is of democratic expansion \u2014 if backlash shapes our \nhistory as much as progress does \u2014 then the current moment is easy to \nunderstand. We are living through a period of democratic erosion, in which \nsocial and political reaction limits the reach and scope of past democratic \nvictories. In this way of looking at the present, we\u2019re living through a period \nof institutional deterioration, during which American government ceases to \nfunction in the face of polarization, zero-sum conflict and constitutional \nhardball. Republican politicians have been the single most important force \nbehind that erosion, breaking norms, backing suppression and welcoming an \nendless flood of money into our politics, all to protect themselves and their \nideology from the will of the people. Viewed in that light, the acquittal of \nPresident Trump \u2014 the desperate cover-up in the face of damning evidence \u2014 is \njust another brick on a road Republicans have been paving for years. It is what \nyou would expect them to do, not because of any fear of the president or \npersonal fealty to him, but because the party sees accountability, whether to \nvoters or to the Constitution itself, as a threat to its interests. If the \nacquittal of Trump shows us anything, it\u2019s a Republican Party free of pretense \nor artifice, ready to embrace its worst self without shame or embarrassment.

By Frankie Huang Ms. Huang is a writer and illustrator. \nSHANGHAI \u2014 It\u2019s been two weeks since Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in \ncentral China, was placed under quarantine, and my husband and I have confined \nourselves to our apartment building in Shanghai, more than 500 miles away, for \nthe same number of days, as requested by authorities. As the lockdown wears on, \nwe\u2019ve stopped changing out of our pajamas, and the days seem to melt into each \nother. Every morning, I reach for my phone on the side table as soon as my eyes \nopen, and I pore over the latest news, the number of new deaths, new confirmed \ninfections, new measures to stem the coronavirus\u2019s progress, new speculations. \nBut everything feels far away from my 23rd-floor apartment. Within these windows\n and walls, we live in our own little world. We have become like hydroponic \nplants in a cushy greenhouse, growing fat on delivered nutrients. Each day, \ncouriers zip over on their electric scooters with takeout, groceries, water. I \nfeel silly as I strap on my mask each time I venture beyond my apartment door to\n pick up deliveries from the building lobby, riding down the elevator that \nsmells sharply of disinfectant. I press the elevator buttons with the edge of my\n key. These precautions feel like role play, but still I dutifully wash my hands\n every time I walk through the door, humming the alphabet song under my breath. \n\u201cShould we leave?\u201d My husband has posed the question to me several times now, \nalways casually, in a level voice, carefully disguising his feelings. We\u2019re both\n American citizens so we can leave anytime we choose. Neither of us wants to be \nthe alarmist in the relationship, not when we are young and healthy and so far \nremoved from harm\u2019s way. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not so dangerous for us.\u201d \u201cTrue.\u201d \u201cFrankly, \nit\u2019s traveling that is scary right now. Getting packed together with a bunch of \nstrangers for 13 hours seems like a terrible idea right now.\u201d \u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d \n\u201cBesides, Shanghai is in good shape. Grocery stores are stocked, we are getting \neverything delivered without any issues, the hospitals are not crowded.\u201d \n\u201cRight.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re good. We\u2019re safe.\u201d I know it\u2019s not entirely logical for me to be\n so keen to stay. Our family and friends are all worried about us, urging us to \nreturn to the United States while we still can, to put an ocean between us and \nthis sprawling epidemic. But I keep thinking, are we entitled cowards for even \nconsidering fleeing while people in Hubei Province (Wuhan is its capital) are \ndealing with overcrowded hospitals, supply shortages, evictions and abuse; while\n medical professionals are on the front line risking their lives? Is a few weeks\n of confinement in the comfort of our home really a good reason to run away? \nEven if the situation in Shanghai becomes less comfortable, we are not helpless.\n We have a couple of boxes of masks, jugs of drinking water, potatoes and \ncabbages, instant noodles, cereal and a couple of frozen steaks. If you think \nthis sounds like half-baked city-mouse logic, you are correct. I have no idea \nhow to handle the situation if it takes a turn for the worse. When I really \nthink about it, it makes no sense for me to be so laid back about this virulent \nnew disease, especially since I have very little trust in the Chinese \ngovernment, given its track record. Maybe I\u2019m not so calm after all. When I peel\n back the veneer of guilt, there is anxiety, simmering darkly. Like everyone \nelse in China, I have few concrete ideas about what is really happening, and I \nam at the mercy of the Chinese government and how it chooses to proceed. But we \nplebes are not privy to the whole truth, even though the truth is part and \nparcel of the trust the government demands. There were a few brief days of \nrigorously reported stories in the local media at the start of the outbreak, but\n then the state propaganda machine swooped back in to limit what the public is \nallowed to know, in the name of promoting positivity and maintaining order. This\n is nothing new. Everyone in China knows better than to take what Communist \nParty mouthpieces tell us at face value, but when 1.4 billion lives are at \nstake, is it still possible to live with the half-truths? In this moment, I feel\n the same primal fear of dying stirring in the rest of China, and it paralyzes \nus. I managed to convince myself for a while that everything would be fine, but \nit was only a matter of time before something came along to shatter this \nillusion. Yesterday, I saw on social media that someone noticed that the ratio \nin the official figures for the total dead to the total diagnosed cases has \nremained exactly 2.1 percent every day since Jan. 30. \u201cThis magical virus is \nvery good at math!\u201d I felt my face crumple as I stared at the numbers. I had \nforgotten that every piece of news must be examined for how it is being used to \nstrengthen the regime\u2019s rule. Even in these times of life and death, I couldn\u2019t \nbe exempted from this exhausting exercise, which the party is perpetually \nplaying for keeps. It smarted like a wound, and the pain gave me clarity. I so \nbadly want to believe in the Chinese government when millions of lives are on \nthe line. I want to have some faith that its decisions are made with the \nintention to save the greatest number of lives. I want to believe that it has \nimposed the world\u2019s largest quarantine \u2014 effectively sacrificing a province of \n58 million people \u2014 because it is for the greater good. I want to believe that \neach drastic measure will pay off, and not just turn out to be glorified P.R. \nstunts. I\u2019m scared of being scared. I don\u2019t want to face how bad things can get,\n how quickly our cozy little home stay could fall apart should the \ninfrastructure cease to run smoothly. A pampered sitting duck is still a sitting\n duck, and I no longer have any illusions about everything turning out fine. \nFrankie Huang (@ourobororoboruo) is a writer and illustrator.

            "full_text": "Opinion The Age of Decadence Cut the drama. The real story of the West in the \n21st century is one of stalemate and stagnation. Credit...Sammy Harkham \nSupported by By Ross Douthat An Opinion columnist and the author of the \nforthcoming book \u201cThe Decadent Society,\u201d from which this essay is adapted. \nEveryone knows that we live in a time of constant acceleration, of vertiginous \nchange, of transformation or looming disaster everywhere you look. Partisans are\n girding for civil war, robots are coming for our jobs, and the news feels like \na multicar pileup every time you fire up Twitter. Our pessimists see crises \neverywhere; our optimists insist that we\u2019re just anxious because the world is \nchanging faster than our primitive ape-brains can process. But what if the \nfeeling of acceleration is an illusion, conjured by our expectations of \nperpetual progress and exaggerated by the distorting filter of the internet? \nWhat if we \u2014 or at least we in the developed world, in America and Europe and \nthe Pacific Rim \u2014 really inhabit an era in which repetition is more the norm \nthan invention; in which stalemate rather than revolution stamps our politics; \nin which sclerosis afflicts public institutions and private life alike; in which\n new developments in science, new exploratory projects, consistently \nunderdeliver? What if the meltdown at the Iowa caucuses, an antique system \nundone by pseudo-innovation and incompetence, was much more emblematic of our \nage than any great catastrophe or breakthrough? The truth of the first decades \nof the 21st century, a truth that helped give us the Trump presidency but will \nstill be an important truth when he is gone, is that we probably aren\u2019t entering\n a 1930-style crisis for Western liberalism or hurtling forward toward \ntranshumanism or extinction. Instead, we are aging, comfortable and stuck, cut \noff from the past and no longer optimistic about the future, spurning both \nmemory and ambition while we await some saving innovation or revelation, growing\n old unhappily together in the light of tiny screens. The farther you get from \nthat iPhone glow, the clearer it becomes: Our civilization has entered into \ndecadence. The word \u201cdecadence\u201d is used promiscuously but rarely precisely. In \npolitical debates, it\u2019s associated with a lack of resolution in the face of \nthreats \u2014 with Neville Chamberlain and W.B. Yeats\u2019s line about the best lacking \nall conviction. In the popular imagination, it\u2019s associated with sex and \ngluttony, with pornographic romances and chocolate strawberries. Aesthetically \nand intellectually it hints at exhaustion, finality \u2014 \u201cthe feeling, at once \noppressive and exalting, of being the last in a series,\u201d in the words of the \nRussian poet Vyacheslav Ivanov. But it\u2019s possible to distill a useful definition\n from all these associations. Following in the footsteps of the great cultural \ncritic Jacques Barzun, we can say that decadence refers to economic stagnation, \ninstitutional decay and cultural and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of \nmaterial prosperity and technological development. Under decadence, Barzun \nwrote, \u201cThe forms of art as of life seem exhausted, the stages of development \nhave been run through. Institutions function painfully. Repetition and \nfrustration are the intolerable result.\u201d He added, \u201cWhen people accept futility \nand the absurd as normal, the culture is decadent.\u201d And crucially, the \nstagnation is often a consequence of previous development: The decadent society \nis, by definition, a victim of its own success. Note that this definition does \nnot imply a definitive moral or aesthetic judgment. (\u201cThe term is not a slur,\u201d \nBarzun wrote. \u201cIt is a technical label.\u201d) A society that generates a lot of bad \nmovies need not be decadent; a society that makes the same movies over and over \nagain might be. A society run by the cruel and arrogant might not be decadent; a\n society where even the wise and good can\u2019t legislate might be. A crime-ridden \nsociety isn\u2019t necessarily decadent; a peaceable, aging, childless society beset \nby flares of nihilistic violence looks closer to our definition. Nor does this \ndefinition imply that decadence is necessarily an overture to a catastrophe, in \nwhich Visigoths torch Manhattan or the coronavirus has dominion over all. \nHistory isn\u2019t always a morality play, and decadence is a comfortable disease: \nThe Chinese and Ottoman empires persisted for centuries under decadent \nconditions, and it was more than 400 years from Caligula to the actual fall of \nRome. \u201cWhat fascinates and terrifies us about the Roman Empire is not that it \nfinally went smash,\u201d wrote W.H. Auden of that endless autumn, but rather that \n\u201cit managed to last for four centuries without creativity, warmth, or hope.\u201d \nWhether we are waiting for Christians or barbarians, a renaissance or the \nSingularity, the dilemma that Auden described is now not Rome\u2019s but ours. II. \n\u201cDo people on your coast think all this is real?\u201d The tech executive sounded \ncurious, proud, a little insecure. We were talking in the San Francisco office \nof a venture capital firm, a vaulted space washed in Californian sun. He was \nreferring to the whole gilded world around the Bay, the entire internet economy.\n That was in 2015. Here are three stories from the five years since. A young man\n comes to New York City. He\u2019s a striver, a hustler, working the borderlands \nbetween entrepreneurship and con artistry. His first effort, a credit card for \naffluent millennials, yanks him into the celebrity economy, where he meets an \nambitious rapper-businessman. Together they plan a kind of internet brokerage \nwhere celebrities can sell their mere presence to the highest bidder. As a \nbrand-enhancing advertisement for the company, they decide to host a major music\n festival \u2014 an exclusive affair on a Caribbean island for influencers, festival \nobsessives and the youthful rich. The festival\u2019s online rollout is a great \nsuccess. There is a viral video of supermodels and Instagram celebrities \nfrolicking on a deserted beach, a sleek website for customers and the curious, \nand in the end, more than 5,000 people buy tickets, at an average cost of $2,500\n to $4,000 \u2014 the superfluity of a rich society, yours for the right sales pitch.\n But the festival as pitched does not exist. Instead, our entrepreneur\u2019s plans \ncollapse one by one. The private island\u2019s owners back out of the deal. The local\n government doesn\u2019t cooperate. Even after all the ticket sales, the money isn\u2019t \nthere, and he has to keep selling new amenities to ticket buyers to pay for the \nones they\u2019ve already purchased. He does have a team working around the clock to \nready \u2026 something for the paying customers, but what they offer in the end is a \nsea of FEMA tents vaguely near a beach, a catering concern that supplies slimy \nsandwiches, and a lot of cheap tequila. Amazingly, the people actually come \u2014 \nbright young things whose Instagram streams become a hilarious chronicle of \ndashed expectations, while the failed entrepreneur tries to keep order with a \nbullhorn before absconding to New York, where he finds disgrace, arrest and the \ninevitable Netflix documentary. That\u2019s the story of Billy McFarland and the Fyre\n Festival. It\u2019s a small-time story; the next one is bigger. A girl grows up in \nTexas, she gets accepted to Stanford, she wants to be Steve Jobs. She has an \nidea that will change an industry that hasn\u2019t changed in years: the boring but \nessential world of blood testing. She envisions a machine, dubbed the Edison, \nthat will test for diseases using just a single drop of blood. And like Jobs she\n quits college to figure out how to build it. Ten years later, she is the \ninternet era\u2019s leading female billionaire, with a stream of venture capital, a \nsprawling campus, a $10 billion valuation for her company, and a lucrative deal \nwith Walgreens to use her machines in every store. Her story is a counterpoint \nto every criticism you hear about Silicon Valley \u2014 that it\u2019s a callow boys\u2019 \nclub, that its virtual realities don\u2019t make the world of flesh and blood a \nbetter place, that it solves problems of convenience but doesn\u2019t cure the sick. \nAnd she is the toast of an elite, in tech and politics alike, that wants to \nbelieve the Edisonian spirit lives on. But the Edison box \u2014 despite endless \neffort and the best tech team that all that venture capital can buy \u2014 doesn\u2019t \nwork. And over time, as the company keeps expanding, it ceases even trying to \ninnovate and becomes instead a fraud, using all its money and big-time backers \nto discredit whistle-blowers. Which succeeds until it doesn\u2019t, at which point \nthe company and all its billions evaporate \u2014 leaving behind a fraud prosecution,\n a best-selling expos\u00e9 and the inevitable podcast and HBO documentary to sustain\n its founder\u2019s fame. That\u2019s the story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos. It\u2019s a \nbig story. But our third story is bigger still, and it isn\u2019t finished yet. An \ninternet company decides to revolutionize an industry \u2014 the taxi and limousine \nmarket \u2014 that defines old-school business-government cooperation, with all the \nattendant bureaucracy and unsatisfying service. It promises investors that it \ncan buy its way to market dominance and use cutting-edge tech to find unglimpsed\n efficiencies. On the basis of that promise, it raises billions of dollars \nacross its 10-year rise, during which time it becomes a byword for internet-era \nsuccess, the model for how to disrupt an industry. By the time it goes public in\n 2019, it has over $11 billion in annual revenue \u2014 real money, exchanged for \nreal services, nothing fraudulent about it. Yet this amazing success story isn\u2019t\n actually making any profit, even at such scale; instead, it\u2019s losing billions, \nincluding $5 billion in one particularly costly quarter. After 10 years of \ngrowth, it has smashed the old business model of its industry, weakened legacy \ncompetitors and created value for consumers \u2014 but it has done all this using the\n awesome power of free money, building a company that would collapse into \nbankruptcy if that money were withdrawn. And it has solved none of the problems \nkeeping it from profitability: The technology it uses isn\u2019t proprietary or \ncomplex; its rival in disruption controls 30 percent of the market; the legacy \nplayers are still very much alive; and all of its paths to reduce its losses \u2014 \ncharging higher prices, paying its workers less \u2014 would destroy the advantages \nthat it has built. So it sits there, a unicorn unlike any other, with a plan to \nbecome profitable that involves vague promises to somehow monetize all its user \ndata and a specific promise that its investment in a different new technology \u2014 \nthe self-driving car, much ballyhooed but as yet not exactly real \u2014 will make \nthe math add up. That\u2019s the story of Uber \u2014 so far. It isn\u2019t an Instagram \nfantasy or a naked fraud; it managed to go public and maintain its outsize \nvaluation, unlike its fellow unicorn WeWork, whose recent attempt at an I.P.O. \nhurled it into crisis. But it is, for now, an example of a major 21st-century \ncompany invented entirely out of surplus, and floated by the hope that with \nenough money and market share, you can will a profitable company into existence.\n Which makes it another case study in what happens when an extraordinarily rich \nsociety can\u2019t find enough new ideas that justify investing all its stockpiled \nwealth. We inflate bubbles and then pop them, invest in Theranos and then \nrepent, and the supposed cutting edge of capitalism is increasingly defined by \ntechnologies that have almost arrived, business models that are on their way to \nprofitability, by runways that go on and on without the plane achieving takeoff.\n Do people on your coast think all this is real? When the tech executive asked \nme that, I told him that we did \u2014 that the promise of Silicon Valley was as much\n an article of faith for those of us watching from the outside as for its \ninsiders; that we both envied the world of digital and believed in it, as the \none place where American innovation was clearly still alive. And I would \nprobably say the same thing now because, despite the stories I\u2019ve just told, the\n internet economy is still as real as 21st-century growth and innovation gets. \nBut what this tells us, unfortunately, is that 21st-century growth and \ninnovation are not at all what we were promised they would be. III. The decadent\n economy is not an impoverished one. The United States is an extraordinarily \nwealthy country, its middle class prosperous beyond the dreams of centuries \npast, its welfare state effective at easing the pain of recessions, and the last\n decade of growth has (slowly) raised our living standard to a new high after \nthe losses from the Great Recession. But slowly compounding growth is not the \nsame as dynamism. American entrepreneurship has been declining since the 1970s: \nEarly in the Jimmy Carter presidency, 17 percent of all United States businesses\n had been founded in the previous year; by the start of Barack Obama\u2019s second \nterm, that rate was about 10 percent. In the late 1980s, almost half of United \nStates companies were \u201cyoung,\u201d meaning less than five years old; by the Great \nRecession, that share was down to only 39 percent, and the share of \u201cold\u201d firms \n(founded more than 15 years ago) rose from 22 percent to 34 percent over a \nsimilar period. And those companies increasingly sit on cash or pass it back to \nshareholders rather than investing in new enterprises. From World War II through\n the 1980s, according to a recent report from Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s office, \nprivate domestic investment often approached 10 percent of G.D.P.; in 2019, \ndespite a corporate tax cut intended to get money off the sidelines, the \ninvestment-to-G.D.P. ratio was less than half of that. This suggests that the \npeople with the most experience starting businesses look around at their \ninvestment opportunities and see many more start-ups that resemble Theranos than\n resemble Amazon, let alone the behemoths of the old economy. And the dearth of \ncorporate investment also means that the steady climb of the stock market has \nboosted the wealth of a rentier class \u2014 basically, already-rich investors \ngetting richer off dividends \u2014 rather than reflecting surging prosperity in \ngeneral. Behind this deceleration lurks the specter of technological stagnation.\n Andrew Yang\u2019s presidential campaign notwithstanding, leaping advances in \nrobotics aren\u2019t about to throw everybody out of work. Productivity growth, the \nbest measure of technology\u2019s effect on the economy, has been weak in the United \nStates and weaker in Europe ever since the first dot-com bust. In 2017 a group \nof economists published a paper asking, \u201cAre Ideas Getting Harder to Find?\u201d The \nanswer was a clear yes: \u201cWe present a wide range of evidence from various \nindustries, products, and firms showing that research effort is rising \nsubstantially while research productivity is declining sharply.\u201d In his 2011 \nbook \u201cThe Great Stagnation,\u201d Tyler Cowen cited an analysis from the Pentagon \nphysicist Jonathan Huebner, who modeled an innovations-to-population ratio for \nthe last 600 years: It shows a slowly ascending arc through the late 19th \ncentury, when major inventions were rather easy to conceive and adopt, and a \nsteepening decline ever since, as rich countries spend more and more on research\n to diminishing returns. These trends don\u2019t mean progress has ceased. Fewer \nblockbuster drugs are being approved, but last month still brought news of a \nsteady generational fall in cancer deaths, and a possible breakthrough in cystic\n fibrosis treatment. Scientific research has a replication crisis, but it\u2019s \nstill easy to discern areas of clear advancement \u2014 from the frontiers of Crispr \nto the study of ancient DNA. But the trends reveal a slowdown, a mounting \ndifficulty in achieving breakthroughs \u2014 a bottleneck if you\u2019re optimistic, a \nceiling if you aren\u2019t. And the relative exception, the internet and all its \nwonders, highlights the general pattern. The Northwestern University economist \nRobert Gordon, one of the most persuasive theorists of stagnation, points out \nthat the period from 1840 to 1970 featured dramatic growth and innovation across\n multiple arenas \u2014 energy and transportation and medicine and agriculture and \ncommunication and the built environment. Whereas in the last two generations, \nprogress has become increasingly monodimensional \u2014 all tech and nothing else. \nEven within the Silicon Valley landscape, the clear success stories are often \nthe purest computer-and-internet enterprises \u2014 social media companies, device \nmanufacturers, software companies \u2014 while the frauds and failures and possible \ncatastrophes involve efforts to use tech to transform some other industry, from \nmusic festivals to office-space rentals to blood tests. The Silicon Valley \ntycoon Peter Thiel, another prominent stagnationist, likes to snark that \u201cwe \nwanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.\u201d And even the people who will\n explain to you, in high seriousness, that nobody would really want a flying car\n can\u2019t get around the basic points that Thiel, Gordon, and others have been \nmaking. Take a single one of the great breakthroughs of the industrial age \u2014 \nplanes and trains and automobiles, antibiotics and indoor plumbing \u2014 and it \nstill looms larger in our everyday existence than all of the contributions of \nthe tech revolution combined. We used to travel faster, build bigger, live \nlonger; now we communicate faster, chatter more, snap more selfies. We used to \ngo to the moon; now we make movies about space \u2014 amazing movies with completely \nconvincing special effects that make it seem as if we\u2019ve left earth behind. And \nwe hype the revolutionary character of our communications devices in order to \nconvince ourselves that our earlier expectations were just fantasies, \u201cJetsons \nstuff\u201d \u2014 that this progress is the only progress we could reasonably expect. IV.\n With this stagnation comes social torpor. America is a more peaceable country \nthan it was in 1970 or 1990, with lower crime rates and safer streets and \nbetter-behaved kids. But it\u2019s also a country where that supposedly most American\n of qualities, wanderlust, has markedly declined: Americans no longer \u201cgo west\u201d \n(or east or north or south) in search of opportunity the way they did 50 years \nago; the rate at which people move between states has fallen from 3.5 percent in\n the early 1970s to 1.4 percent in 2010. Nor do Americans change jobs as often \nas they once did. For all the boosterish talk about retraining and self-\nemployment, all the fears of a precarious job market, Americans are less likely \nto switch employers than they were a generation ago. Meanwhile, those well-\nbehaved young people are more depressed than prior cohorts, less likely to drive\n drunk or get pregnant but more tempted toward self-harm. They are also the most\n medicated generation in history, from the drugs prescribed for A.D.H.D. to the \nantidepressants offered to anxious teens, and most of the medications are \ndesigned to be calming, offering a smoothed-out experience rather than a spiky \nhigh. For adults, the increasingly legal drug of choice is marijuana, whose \nprototypical user is a relaxed and harmless figure \u2014 comfortably numb, \nexperiencing stagnation as a chill good time. And then there is the opioid \nepidemic, whose spread across the unhappiest parts of white America passed \nalmost unnoticed in elite circles for a while because the drug itself quiets \nrather than inflames, supplying a gentle euphoria that lets its users simply \nslip away, day by day and bit by bit, without causing anyone any trouble. The \nbest book on the epidemic, by the journalist Sam Quinones, is called \u201cDreamland\u201d\n for a reason. In the land of the lotus eaters, people are also less likely to \ninvest in the future in the most literal of ways. The United States birthrate \nwas once an outlier among developed countries, but since the Great Recession, it\n has descended rapidly, converging with the wealthy world\u2019s general below-\nreplacement norm. This demographic decline worsens economic stagnation; \neconomists reckoning with its impact keep finding stark effects. A 2016 analysis\n found that a 10 percent increase in the fraction of the population over 60 \ndecreased the growth rate of states\u2019 per capita G.D.P. by 5.5 percent. A 2018 \npaper found that companies in younger labor markets are more innovative; another\n found that the aging of society helped explain the growth of monopolies and the\n declining rate of start-ups. This feedback loop \u2014 in which sterility feeds \nstagnation, which further discourages childbearing, which sinks society ever-\ndeeper into old age \u2014 makes demographic decline a clear example of how decadence\n overtakes a civilization. For much of Western history, declining birthrates \nreflected straightforward gains to human welfare: victories over infant \nmortality, over backbreaking agrarian economies, over confining expectations for\n young women. But once we crossed over into permanent below-replacement \nterritory, the birth dearth began undercutting the very forces (youth, risk \n-taking, dynamism) necessary for continued growth, meaning that any further \ngains to individual welfare are coming at the future\u2019s expense. V. Now the \nreader will probably have an obvious objection to this portrait of senescence \nand stagnation: What about politics? Would a decadent society really reproduce \nthe 1969 Days of Rage on social media, with online mobs swarming and the old \nextremes back in action? Would it produce a populist surge and a socialist \nrevival, a domestic civil war so polarizing that Americans could mistake the \nwork of Russian hackers for the sincere convictions of their fellow citizens? \nWould it elect Donald Trump as president? Strangely, the answer might be \u201cyes.\u201d \nBoth populism and socialism, Trump and Bernie Sanders, represent expressions of \ndiscontent with decadence, rebellions against the technocratic management of \nstagnation that defined the Obama era. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is the slogan \nof a reactionary futurism, a howl against a future that wasn\u2019t what was \npromised, and the Sanders Revolution promises that what the left lost somewhere \nin the Reagan era can be regained, and the climb to utopia begun anew. But the \ndesire for a different future only goes so far, and in practical terms the \npopulist era has mostly delivered a new and deeper stalemate. From Trump\u2019s \nWashington to the capitals of Europe, Western politics is now polarized between \nanti-establishment forces that are unprepared to competently govern and an \nestablishment that\u2019s too disliked to effectively rule. The structures of the \nWestern system, the United States Constitution and administrative state, the \nhalf-built federalism of the European Union, are everywhere creaking and \neverywhere critiqued. But our stalemates make them impervious to substantial \nreform, let alone to revolution. The most strident European nationalists don\u2019t \neven want to leave the European Union, and Trump\u2019s first term has actually been \nmuch like Obama\u2019s second, with failed legislation and contested executive \norders, and policy made mostly by negotiation between the bureaucracy and the \ncourts. There is a virtual Trump presidency whose depredations terrify liberals,\n one that airs on Fox in which Trump goes from strength to strength. But the \nreal thing is closer to the genre the president knows best, reality television, \nthan to the actual return of history. (Trump\u2019s recent State of the Union, with \nits theatrics and premature declaration of victory over decadence, was a \nparticularly striking case in point.) Likewise in the wider political culture. \nThe madness of online crowds, the way the internet has allowed the return of \ncertain forms of political extremism and the proliferation of conspiracy \ntheories \u2014 yes, if our decadence is to end in the return of grand ideological \ncombat and street-brawl politics, this might be how that ending starts. But our \nbattles mostly still reflect what Barzun called \u201cthe deadlocks of our time\u201d \u2014 \nthe Kavanaugh Affair replaying the Clarence Thomas hearings, the debates over \npolitical correctness cycling us backward to fights that were fresh and new in \nthe 1970s and \u201980s. The hysteria with which we\u2019re experiencing them may \nrepresent nothing more than the way that a decadent society manages its \npolitical passions, by encouraging people to playact extremism, to re-enact the \n1930s or 1968 on social media, to approach radical politics as a sport, a hobby,\n a kick to the body chemistry, that doesn\u2019t put anything in their relatively \ncomfortable late-modern lives at risk. Close Twitter, log off Facebook, turn off\n cable television, and what do you see in the Trump-era United States? Campuses \nin tumult? No: The small wave of campus protests, most of them focused around \nparochial controversies, crested before Trump\u2019s election and have diminished \nsince. Urban riots? No: The post-Ferguson flare of urban protest has died down. \nA wave of political violence? A small spike, maybe, but one that\u2019s more \nanalogous to school shootings than to the political clashes of the 1930s or \n\u201960s, in the sense that it involves disturbed people appointing themselves \nknights-errant and going forth to slaughter, rather than organized movements \nwith any kind of concrete goal. Internet-era political derangement is partially \nresponsible for white supremacists goading one another into shooting sprees, or \nthe Sanders supporter who tried to massacre Republicans at a congressional \nbaseball game in 2017. But these episodes are terrible and also exceptional; \nthey have not yet established a pattern that looks anything like the early \n1970s, when there were more than 2,500 bombings across the continental United \nStates in one 18-month period. Maybe today\u2019s outliers are the forerunners of \nsomething worse. But our terrorists don\u2019t feel like prophets or precursors; they\n often feel more like marks. The terrorist in 21st-century America isn\u2019t the guy\n who sees more deeply than the rest; he\u2019s the guy who doesn\u2019t get it, who takes \nthe stuff he reads on the internet literally in a way that most of the people \nposting don\u2019t, who confuses virtual entertainment with reality. The left-winger \nwho tries to assassinate Republicans isn\u2019t just a little deeper into the \nResistance mind-set than the average activist; he\u2019s the guy who totally \nmisunderstands the Resistance, who listens to all the online talk about treason \nand Fascism and thinks that he\u2019s really in 1940s France. The guy who parks his \ntruck on the Hoover Dam and demands that certain imaginary indictments be \nunsealed isn\u2019t just a little more action oriented than the typical QAnon \nconspiracy theorist; he fundamentally misunderstands those labyrinthine \ntheories, taking them as literal claims about the world rather than as what they\n are for their creators (a sport, a grift, a hobby) and for most of their \nparticipants (an odd form of virtual community). This doesn\u2019t excuse the \ngrifting or the rage stoking, especially presidential grifting and rage stoking,\n and it doesn\u2019t make the mass shootings, when they come, any less horrific. But \nit\u2019s important context for thinking about whether online politics is really \ncarrying our society downward into civil strife. It suggests that the virtual \nrealm might make our battles more ferocious but also more performative and \nempty; and that online rage is a steam-venting technology for a society that is \nmisgoverned, stagnant and yet, ultimately, far more stable than it looks on \nTwitter. If you want to feel as if Western society is convulsing, there\u2019s an app\n for that, a convincing simulation waiting. But in the real world, it\u2019s possible\n that Western society is leaning back in an easy chair, hooked up to a drip of \nsomething soothing, playing and replaying an ideological greatest-hits tape from\n its wild and crazy youth. Which is, to be clear, hardly the worst fate \nimaginable. Complaining about decadence is a luxury good \u2014 a feature of \nsocieties where the mail is delivered, the crime rate is relatively low, and \nthere is plenty of entertainment at your fingertips. Human beings can still live\n vigorously amid a general stagnation, be fruitful amid sterility, be creative \namid repetition. And the decadent society, unlike the full dystopia, allows \nthose signs of contradictions to exist, which means that it\u2019s always possible to\n imagine and work toward renewal and renaissance. This is not always true when \nyou gamble on a revolution: The last hundred-odd years of Western history offer \nplenty of examples of how the attempt to throw off decadence can bring in far \nworse evils, from the craving for Meaning and Action that piled corpses at \nVerdun and Passchendaele, to the nostalgic yearning for the Cold War that \ninspired post-9/11 crusading and led to a military quagmire in the Middle East. \nSo you can even build a case for decadence, not as a falling-off or \ndisappointing end, but as a healthy balance between the misery of poverty and \nthe dangers of growth for growth\u2019s sake. A sustainable decadence, if you will, \nin which the crucial task for 21st-century humanity would be making the most of \na prosperous stagnation: learning to temper our expectations and live within \nlimits; making sure existing resources are distributed more justly; using \neducation to lift people into the sunlit uplands of the creative class; and \ndoing everything we can to help poorer countries transition successfully into \nour current position. Not because meliorism can cure every ill, but because the \nmore revolutionary alternatives are too dangerous, and a simple greatest-good-\nfor-the-greatest-number calculus requires that we just keep the existing system \nrunning and give up more ambitious dreams. But this argument carries you only so\n far. Even if the dystopia never quite arrives, the longer a period of \nstagnation continues, the narrower the space for fecundity and piety, memory and\n invention, creativity and daring. The unresisted drift of decadence can lead \ninto a territory of darkness, whose sleekness covers over a sickness unto death.\n And true dystopias are distinguished, in part, by the fact that many people \ninside them don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re living in one, because human beings are \nadaptable enough to take even absurd and inhuman premises for granted. If we \nfeel that elements of our own system are, shall we say, dystopia-ish \u2014 from the \nreality-television star in the White House to the addictive surveillance devices\n always in our hands; from the drugs and suicides in our hinterlands to the \nsterility of our rich cities \u2014 then it\u2019s possible that an outsider would look at\n our decadence and judge it more severely still. So decadence must be critiqued \nand resisted \u2014 not by fantasies of ennobling world wars, not by Tyler Durden \nfrom \u201cFight Club\u201d planning to blow every Ikea living room sky-high, but by the \nhope that where there\u2019s stability, there also might eventually be renewal, that \ndecadence need not give way to collapse to be escaped, that the renaissance can \nhappen without the misery of an intervening dark age. Today we are just 50 years\n removed from the peak of human accomplishment and daring that put human beings \non the moon, and all the ferment that surrounded it. The next renaissance will \nbe necessarily different, but realism about our own situation should make us \nmore inclined, not less, to look and hope for one \u2014 for the day when our culture\n feels more fruitful, our politics less futile and the frontiers that seem \nclosed today are opened once again.
