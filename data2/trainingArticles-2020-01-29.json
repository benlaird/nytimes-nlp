            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Is Trump Bibi\u2019s Chump? The president needs to demand \na commitment so he doesn\u2019t get played. By Thomas L. Friedman Opinion Columnist \nTEL AVIV \u2014 Given the timing of the release on Tuesday of President Trump\u2019s \nMiddle East peace plan, I have to begin by asking: Is this plan about two states\n for two peoples or is it about one diversion for two dirty leaders? It sure \nfeels like the latter. After all, both President Trump and Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu are, in effect, facing job-threatening charges \u2014 Trump for \nobstruction of Congress and abuse of power and Bibi, who was literally indicted \non Tuesday, for fraud, bribery and breach of trust. They both had a huge need to\n change the subject and shore up their common base of right-wing Jews and \nevangelicals. If I were Jared Kushner and had worked for three years on a peace \nplan \u2014 and was serious about it getting a fair and full hearing from all sides \u2014\n there is no way I would have released it right now. This smells. But then my \nlong-held view has always been that the Middle East puts a smile on your face \nonly if a change for the better starts with them. Camp David started with \nIsraelis and Egyptians, and America was brought in only later. Oslo was started \nby Israelis and Palestinians, and America joined only later. Tunisia, the only \nArab Spring country to make its way to democracy, is the one Arab country that \nAmerica had virtually nothing to do with. For a peace initiative to be serious \nand sustainable, it should always start with them. And yet, I also know that \nwhen America puts something this detailed on the table, it cannot be ignored, at\n least in the near term. Netanyahu already announced that with Trump\u2019s blessings\n Israel will quickly move to apply its law (tantamount to annexation) to the \nWest Bank\u2019s Jordan Valley and all Jewish settlements in the occupied territory. \nIt will be interesting to see how the European Union, which funds much of the \nPalestinian governing infrastructure in the West Bank, responds once it\u2019s \nstudied the plan, not to mention the reaction of everyday Palestinians and \nArabs. (I don\u2019t expect much. This conflict seems to have passed its fix-by \ndate.) O.K., despite the obvious political motivation for the timing of the \nrelease of this plan, not to mention much of its substance, is there anything in\n it that would impress me that the Trump administration is actually serious \nabout promoting a two-state solution \u2014 and actually has a strategy to achieve \none? Yes, if our president did something hard. What would that be? It would be \nhis telling Netanyahu that before Bibi extends Israeli law to all these West \nBank settlements and the Jordan Valley, Trump wants one thing: an unequivocal \npublic statement that Netanyahu accepts the fact that while Israel is getting \nEast Jerusalem, more than 20 percent of the core West Bank, with all its \nsettlements, plus the Jordan Valley, the remaining roughly 70 percent will \nbecome an independent Palestinian state, if Palestinians agree to all sorts of \nsecurity requirements. Trump needs to say to Netanyahu: \u201cBibi, you say that I am\n the most pro-Israel president to ever sit in the White House. This plan was \nwritten with your team. I have supported your maximum position \u2014 absorbing all \nthe Jewish settlements into Israel and all of traditional Jerusalem, and with no\n return of Palestinian refugees to Israel. Now I need to know, the Palestinians \nneed to know, and the world needs to know, that this is not your new starting \nposition. Will you agree right now that the remaining land will be a Palestinian\n state if the Palestinians agree to demilitarization and recognize Israel as a \nJewish state? Will you agree \u2014 right now \u2014 to make no further claims ever to the\n West Bank and not build another settlement ever outside the areas that the \nTrump plan assigns to Israel?\u201d If Trump were to spend just a little bit of \npolitical capital doing that, I might start to take this plan seriously. But if \nNetanyahu is allowed to evade that question, or turns Trump down with no \nconsequences, then this whole thing truly is a farce \u2014 it\u2019s just the new \nbaseline for Netanyahu\u2019s next West Bank land grab. Indeed, if Bibi says he still\n wants more than this plan gives him already \u2014 as ultranationalists in his \ncoalition argue \u2014 then he is openly declaring before the president of the United\n States that his appetite is for all of the West Bank and that his vision for \nIsrael is that it become a binational/apartheid state that will hold the 2.5 \nmillion Palestinians of the West Bank without full political rights. This is the\n moment when we find out whether Bibi \u2014 who for decades has told American \npresidents, \u201cTest me with a real plan and I will show you that I can be a great \nleader\u201d \u2014 has any greatness in him whatsoever or is just a corrupt political \nhack looking to stay out of jail and will do any short-term maneuver necessary, \nregardless of its long-term impact on Israel, to do so. Because if Bibi is \nserious that his ambitions stop at what he\u2019s now gotten from Trump, then he \nneeds a whole new domestic coalition \u2014 the ultra-zealots in his coalition will \nbe up in arms \u2014 and a more moderate national unity government in Israel might \neven be possible. At the same time, while I understand why Palestinian leaders \nare denouncing this plan, they should nevertheless try to make some lemonade out\n of these Trump lemons. It\u2019s not as if they have a lot of great options, and \ntheir resistance to the Israeli occupation has gotten them nowhere. Palestinian \nleaders have been feckless and divided for some time; they boycotted the design \nof this plan. Still, if I were them, I\u2019d tell Trump, \u201cYes, but we will use this \nplan as a floor in negotiations with Israelis, not a ceiling.\u201d They would surely\n gain a lot of U.S., Arab and European good will for trying that approach. What \ndo they have to lose? But bottom line: Without Trump getting Netanyahu to \ndefinitively end his claims to all of the West Bank, and without Palestinian \nleaders able to reunite their disparate political factions in Gaza and the West \nBank into a single body that can theoretically say \u201cyes\u201d to a fair outcome for \ntheir people, while also recognizing Israel as a Jewish state, Trump\u2019s Deal of \nthe Century will join a century-old library of failed Middle East peace plans. \nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Trump\u2019s Digital Advantage Is Freaking Out Democratic \nStrategists Left and right agree on one point. The president\u2019s re-election \ncampaign is way ahead online. By Thomas B. Edsall Mr. Edsall contributes a \nweekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. In\n a blog post published in November, a year before the 2020 election, Brian \nBurch, the president of CatholicVote.org, a socially conservative advocacy \ngroup, announced that in Wisconsin alone his organization had identified 199,241\n Catholics \u201cwho\u2019ve been to church at least 3 times in the last 90 days.\u201d Nearly \nhalf of these religiously observant parishioners, Burch wrote, \u201c91,373 mass-\nattending Catholics \u2014 are not even registered to vote!\u201d CatholicVote.org is \nlooking for potential Trump voters within this large, untapped reservoir \u2014 \nRepublican-leaning white Catholics who could bolster Trump\u2019s numbers in a \nbattleground state. Burch, whose organization opposes abortion and gay marriage,\n made his plans clear: We are already building the largest Catholic voter \nmobilization program ever. And no, that\u2019s not an exaggeration. Our plan spans at\n least 7 states (and growing), and includes millions of Catholic voters. How did\n Catholic Vote come up with these particular church attendance numbers for \n199,241 Catholics? With geofencing, a technology that creates a virtual \ngeographic boundary, enabling software to trigger a response when a cellphone \nenters or leaves a particular area \u2014 a church, for example, or a stadium, a \nschool or an entire town. Geofencing is just one of the new tools of digital \ncampaigning, a largely unregulated field of political combat in which voters \nhave little or no idea of how they are being manipulated, in which traditional \ndisclosure requirements are inoperative and key actors are anonymous. It is a \nweapon of choice. Once an area is geofenced, commercial data companies can \nacquire the mobile phone ID numbers of those within the boundary. This is how \nthe National Catholic Reporter described the process in an article earlier this \nmonth: Politically minded geofencers capture data from the cellphones of \nchurchgoers, and then purchase ads targeting those devices. That data can be \nmatched against other easily obtained databases, including voter profiles, which\n give marketers identifying information such as names, addresses and voter \nregistration status. Such information can be a gold mine. Burch described what \nCatholicVote.org initiated in the 2018 election. \u201cWe created ad campaigns \ntargeted to mobile devices that have been inside of Catholic churches,\u201d Burch \nexplained. What\u2019s more, We told Catholics in Missouri the truth about then-\nSenator Claire McCaskill \u2014 that she was pro-abortion, was unwilling to protect \nthe Little Sisters of the Poor, and opposed Catholic judicial nominees because \nof their religious beliefs. And she lost. If you attend an evangelical or a \nCatholic Church, a women\u2019s rights march or a political rally of any kind, \nespecially in a seriously contested state, the odds are that your cellphone ID \nnumber, home address, partisan affiliation and the identifying information of \nthe people around you will be provided by geofencing marketers to campaigns, \nlobbyists and other interest groups. With increasing speed, digital technology \nis transforming politics, constantly providing novel ways to target specific \nindividuals, to get the unregistered registered, to turn out marginal voters, to\n persuade the undecided and to suppress support for the opposition. Democrats \nand Republicans agree that the Trump campaign is far ahead of the Democratic \nParty in the use of this technology, capitalizing on its substantial investment \nduring the 2016 election and benefiting from an uninterrupted high-tech drive \nsince then. Republicans \u201chave a big advantage this time,\u201d Ben Nuckels, a \nDemocratic media consultant said in a phone interview. \u201cThey not only have all \nthe data from 2016 but they have been building this operation into a nonstop \njuggernaut.\u201d The new technology, Nuckels continued, allows campaigns to \u201cdeliver\n a broader narrative over the top\u201d on television and other media, while \n\u201cunderneath in digital you are delivering ads that are tailored to those voters \nthat you need to influence and persuade the most.\u201d The explosion of digital \ntechnology has created the opportunity for political operatives to run what \namount to dark campaigns, conducted below the radar of both voter awareness and \ngovernment oversight. In some cases, the technology is very simple: the \nanonymous transmission of negative images of candidates by individuals to \nFacebook groups. This activity is neither reported to the Federal Election \nCommission nor linked to official campaigns. Steven Livingston, a professor of \nmedia and public affairs and director of the Institute for Data, Democracy and \nPolitics at George Washington University, has been tracking this sub rosa \nelectioneering in the current election cycle. He found that supporters of two \ncandidates, Trump and Bernie Sanders, are the primary practitioners. The \nWashington Post and The New York Times have both reported on the activities of \nSanders supporters, but, Livingston noted in an email, \u201cOur evidence suggests \nthat Trump supporters use automated promotion or cross posting four times as \nmuch as Sanders supporters.\u201d Livingston described \u201cthese digital shadow \ncampaigns\u201d as \u201canalogous to and perhaps an actual digital manifestation of \u2018dark\n money\u2019 influence campaigns.\u201d In addition, he continued, Overwhelmingly, these \npages and groups do not have ownership declarations or Facebook verifications. \nWe simply do not know what other digital properties might be operated by common \nsources with the groups. There is money being spent but we don\u2019t know the \nsources. It is unaccountable spending. Livingston provided some of the kind of \nnegative messages and images promoted by anonymous pro-Trump activists. Here is \none: And here is one made by a Sanders enthusiast: Experts in the explosively \ngrowing field of political digital technologies have developed an innovative \nterminology to describe what they do \u2014 a lexicon that is virtually \nincomprehensible to ordinary voters. This language provides an inkling of the \nextraordinarily arcane universe politics has entered: geofencing, mass \npersonalization, dark patterns, identity resolution technologies, dynamic \nprospecting, geotargeting strategies, location analytics, geo-behavioural \nsegment, political data cloud, automatic content recognition, dynamic creative \noptimization. Geofencing and other emerging digital technologies derive from \nmicrotargeting marketing initiatives that use consumer and other demographic \ndata to identify the interests of specific voters or very small groups of like-\nminded individuals to influence their thoughts or actions. Microtargeting first \nhad a significant impact on American politics in state level campaign work by \nAlec Gage, a Republican, and his firm TargetPoint in 2002. Now, political \noperatives are exploiting commercial techniques to correlate microtargeting data\n with the identification numbers of cellphones. This allows campaigns to \nmobilize, persuade and turn out \u2014 or to suppress turnout among \u2014 key voters. In \n2016, Trump spent far more than Hillary Clinton on digital campaigning, and \nsince then his campaign, under the direction of Brad Parscale, has continued far\n outpace its Democratic rivals. In a paper published this month, \u201cThe digital \ncommercialization of US politics \u2014 2020 and beyond,\u201d Kathryn Montgomery, a \nprofessor of communications at American University, and Jeff Chester, executive \ndirector of the Center for Digital Democracy, described the differences between \nthe 2016 Trump and Clinton campaigns: Whereas 31 percent of Donald Trump\u2019s total\n campaign expenditures were for digital media, only 6 percent of Hillary \nClinton\u2019s expenditures were for digital. Moreover, whereas almost 50 percent of \nMr. Trump\u2019s media expenditures were for digital, only 8 percent of Secretary \nClinton\u2019s media expenditures were for digital. So although Secretary Clinton \noutspent Mr. Trump by $75 million on media, it is quite possible that Mr. \nTrump\u2019s heavy reliance on digital media allowed for a more efficient and \ntargeted ad campaign that escaped the eye. Parscale, who is now managing Trump\u2019s\n 2020 campaign, claimed in a 2018 tweet that the Trump campaign tech operation \nwas \u201c100 times to 200 times\u201d more effective than the Clinton campaign\u2019s, adding \n\u201c@realDonaldTrump was a perfect candidate for Facebook.\u201d On Monday, Parscale \nboasted on the conservative website Townhall that Trump rallies are providing a \ngold mine of data for the 2020 election: Out of more than 20,000 identified \nvoters who came to a recent Trump rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 57.9 percent \ndid not have a history of voting for Republicans. Remarkably, 4,413 attendees \ndidn\u2019t even vote in the last election \u2014 a clear indication that President Trump \nis energizing Americans who were previously not engaged in politics. Similar \nfindings are coming out of other rallies, according to Parscale: Nearly 22 \npercent of identified supporters at President Trump\u2019s rally in Toledo, Ohio, \nwere Democrats, and another 21 percent were independents. An astounding 15 \npercent of identified voters who saw the president speak in Battle Creek, \nMichigan, has not voted in any of the last four elections. In Hershey, \nPennsylvania, just over 20 percent of identified voters at the rally were \nDemocrats, and 18 percent were nonwhite. In the current election cycle, \nMontgomery and Chester write, further growth and expansion of the big data \ndigital marketplace is reshaping electoral politics in the US, introducing both \ncandidate and issue campaigns to a system of sophisticated software applications\n and data-targeting tools that are rooted in the goals, values, and strategies \nfor influencing consumer behaviors. Technologies used for \u201cidentity resolution,\u201d\n they write, enable marketers \u2014 and political groups \u2014 to target and \u2018reach real\n people\u2019 with greater precision than ever before. Marketers are helping perfect \na system that leverages and integrates, increasingly in real-time, consumer \nprofile data with online behaviors to capture more granular profiles of \nindividuals, including where they go, and what they do. The authors go on to \nwarn that \u201call of these developments are taking place, moreover, within a \nregulatory structure that is weak and largely ineffectual.\u201d Tara McGowan, \nexecutive director of the recently created pro-Democratic group Acronym, which \nplans to spend $75 million on digital and other media, replied to my questions \nby email: There\u2019s no digital dark magic being deployed by Brad Parscale and the \nTrump campaign. They just have near unlimited resources and are spending them \nwisely to reach their voters where they are \u2014 online, and especially on \nplatforms like Facebook. The greatest advantage, McGowan continued, that the \nTrump campaign has over Democrats heading into 2020 is time. Democrats may not \nsettle on a general election nominee until late spring or summer. That gives the\n Trump campaign much more time to talk to voters and define the Democrats in \nplaces where it counts. In addition to ACRONYM, pro-Democratic groups like \nPriorities USA, American Bridge, America Votes and a host of others are working \ntogether, prepared to spend more than $300 million to counter the Trump efforts.\n In addition, the campaigns of Mike Bloomberg, Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer are\n all spending huge amounts of money on digital strategies focused on Facebook, \nGoogle and other social media. Still, there are concerns that much of the \nDemocratic spending will have limited value in the general election, insofar as \nit is going toward states that will not be 2020 battlegrounds, including, for \nexample, Alabama, Arkansas, California, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah\n and Vermont on Tuesday March 3, better known as Super Tuesday. In addition, \nwhoever becomes the Democratic nominee will not be able to share his or her data\n with the independent pro-Democratic groups, according to federal regulation. \nApple, Google and most other major internet players have adopted privacy \npolicies that would appear to significantly constrain the ability of data \nmanagement firms to obtain detailed household information, consumer spending and\n partisan leanings of smartphone users. But it turns out that there are ways to \nget around the rules. Serge Egelman, a research director at Berkeley\u2019s \nInternational Computer Science Institute and a co-author of the paper \u201c50 Ways \nto Leak Your Data: An Exploration of Apps\u2019 Circumvention of the Android \nPermissions System,\u201d replied to my email: Most users are likely of the \nimpression that apps will only collect the personal data that they\u2019re asked \nabout in the \u2018permissions dialogues\u2019 that they encounter (i.e., pop-up \nnotifications asking if it\u2019s O.K. for an app to access certain data, such as \nlocation, address book contacts, photos, etc.). These unsuspecting users were \nmistaken. We discovered that there are \u201cback channels\u201d through which the same \ndata is available without having to present the user with a permission dialogue.\n What does this mean for politics? We know that many of these entities are data \nbrokers and analytics companies that are in the business of using this type of \ndata to profile mobile device users, and then selling these profiles to various \nentities, including political campaigns. The data generally provides information\n about individual users\u2019 day-to-day activities and preferences: Where they shop;\n What they do for fun; What other apps they use, for how long, and what they do \nin those apps; Where they live; Where they work; With whom they associate. This \ndata, he added, enables campaigns to list \u201cindividual attendees at political \nrallies;\u201d to identify \u201cpolitical leanings based on online and offline \npreferences (where you live, work, shop, play, etc.); and to segment \u201cads based \non inferred psychographic traits (i.e., exactly what Cambridge Analytica did, \nbut instead of personalized political ads on Facebook, users get personalized \nads in potentially all of their mobile apps).\u201d Egelman noted that \u201cfrom the \nuser\u2019s perspective, there\u2019s literally no way of preventing it from happening or \neven knowing when it\u2019s happening.\u201d The expectation \u201cthat app users should be \nable to figure this all out and manage it is absolutely ludicrous.\u201d A pro-\nDemocratic strategist who is helping coordinate the independent effort to defeat\n Trump \u2014 and who insisted on anonymity to protect his job \u2014 described what he \nbelieves is the current state of play in the role of digital technology in \nlarger, overall strategy: There\u2019s no question that as a technical matter, the \nRepublicans and the Kochs are spending much more and have better data than \nDemocrats/progressives. But they also have a much more difficult product to \nsell: Trump. If Marco Rubio were president in this thriving economy, he \ncontinued, \u201c2020 would not be a competitive election, and the Democrats might \nnot have claimed the House in 2018.\u201d \u201cCrucially,\u201d the strategist said, Trump has\n two relevant advantages deriving from the asymmetry between the flow of \nRepublican and Democratic information. First, when Trump says something, Fox \nrepeats it. When a Democrat says something, The New York Times and the rest of \nthe MSM knock it down if it\u2019s false or debatable. In other words, a huge swath \nof Trump-supportive media does not perform fact-based journalism. In addition, \nthe Democratic strategist said, Trump benefits enormously because of the Right\u2019s\n aligned network of media properties (i.e., Sinclair), Facebook properties, \nYouTube influencers and bots/sock puppets. This kind of amplification network \nbarely exists for Democrats/progressives. While studies show that \u201cdigital ads \nhave at most a slight persuasive effect,\u201d he noted, the real goal of paid \nadvertising is for the content to become organic social media. For example, a \nTrump ad saying that he\u2019s brought back manufacturing jobs would persuade almost \nno one. But, when local news or your neighbor starts repeating that, it becomes \nmore credible and persuasive. That\u2019s what they\u2019re after. To sum up, their \ncontent is advantaged because it reaches their target audiences, without \nfriction, from the media that audience trusts, and is quickly and reliably \nrepeated by other voices they trust in their world. What\u2019s the bottom line? \nFinally, there\u2019s the question of the size of the value of Trump\u2019s data/digital \nadvantage. Big enough to enable him to win the popular vote? Almost certainly \nnot. Big enough to win Wisconsin? Frighteningly so. The Times is committed to \npublishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Tech Loses a Prophet. Just When It Needs One. Clay \nChristensen\u2019s bracing ideas about management are more relevant than ever as the \ntech industry seeks redemption. By Kara Swisher Ms. Swisher covers technology \nand is a contributing opinion writer. It\u2019s nothing but noise, all the time. We \nget hammered every second from an incessant sousaphone of tweets and from the \nrighteous rage machine that screams at us in this digitized 24/7/365 \ncommunications world that we have built. What you might not know is that we have\n long had a name for what started this all: \u201cdisruptive innovation.\u201d The concept\n was pioneered by Clay Christensen, a high-profile and well-regarded Harvard \nprofessor of management who died of cancer last week at 67. Professor \nChristensen\u2019s remarkable legacy grew out of a seminal book he published in 1997,\n \u201cThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma.\u201d The book covered esoteric industries like the disk \ndrives market and excavating to analyze and illustrate the power of disruptive \ntechnologies. His ideas exploded through the then-nascent internet scene and \nthroughout Silicon Valley. I recall reading an early copy and thinking that it \nwas a manifesto that the tech world would embrace \u2014 and that Professor \nChristensen was tech\u2019s prophet. The Intel founder and chief executive Andy Grove\n was a fan. So was the Apple legend Steve Jobs. Both men were doubtlessly \nattracted to the idea that start-ups made up of outsiders could find ways to \ncreate new markets and new value \u2014 and disrupt and overwhelm established \ncompanies. In the face of disruption, older companies could do almost nothing. \nIt wasn\u2019t that they couldn\u2019t see the new threats of start-ups, but that they \nwere stuck on serving their current businesses, and they failed to change their \nproducts and services out of fear of cutting into profits. Professor \nChristensen\u2019s formula was elegant: \u201cFirst, disruptive products are simpler and \ncheaper; they generally promise lower margins, not greater profits. Second, \ndisruptive technologies typically are first commercialized in emerging or \ninsignificant markets. And third, leading firms\u2019 most profitable customers \ngenerally don\u2019t want, and indeed initially can\u2019t use, products based on \ndisruptive technologies.\u201d It was that simple. Professor Christensen\u2019s book came \nout a year before Google was founded, seven years before Facebook, eight years \nbefore YouTube and 11 years before Uber. Each of these companies, knowingly or \nunknowingly, would follow his map. While Professor Christensen would go on to \nwrite a sequel and many more books on adjacent topics ripe for disruption, like \neducation (\u201cDisrupting Class\u201d in 2008) and health care (\u201cInnovator\u2019s \nPrescription\u201d in 2009), it was his initial idea that was devastatingly \ninsightful. I use the term devastate because, though no fault of Professor \nChristensen\u2019s, disruptive innovation took a turn for the worse in tech. Silicon \nValley failed to marry disruption with a concept of corporate responsibility, \nand growth at all costs became its motto. The more measured approach that \nProfessor Christensen taught was ignored. Thus, in tech, the idea was more like \n\u201cdestructive innovation,\u201d which to me was distilled in Facebook\u2019s famous sign \nthat was once plastered all over the walls at its headquarters: \u201cMove Fast and \nBreak Things.\u201d I have always wondered why the company chose those words. I have \nno problem with \u201cmove fast,\u201d which Professor Christensen would not have quibbled\n with, since being nimble was a core competency that he touted. It was the word \n\u201cbreak\u201d that stuck in my head like a bad migraine. Why use a violent and \nthoughtless word like \u201cbreak\u201d and not one more hopeful, like \u201cchange\u201d or \n\u201ctransform\u201d or \u201cinvent\u201d? And, if \u201cbreak\u201d was to be the choice, what would happen\n after the breaking? Would there be fixing? Could there be any fixing after the \nbreaking? \u201cBreak\u201d sounded painful. And, back to today\u2019s subject, Professor \nChristensen never talked about that. In fact, Professor Christensen\u2019s approach \nwas quite the opposite. He learned in 2010 that he had lymphoma, then he had a \nstroke. Within two years, he published the book that I like best, titled \u201cHow \nWill You Measure Your Life?\u201d It is at turns spiritual and sometimes self-helpy, \ntaking Professor Christensen\u2019s management thinking and applying it to how to \nlive a life. This book should be newly relevant, as tech is casting about for \nits next act; we\u2019ve been talking about the negative impact of tech\u2019s disruptive \ninnovations for a while now. Techies measure everything \u2014 and so Professor \nChristensen\u2019s bracing prescriptions are perhaps perfect as the tech industry \nseeks redemption. For example, he wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s easier to hold your principles \n100 percent of the time than it is to hold them 98 percent of the time.\u201d And: \n\u201cIn fact, how you allocate your own resources can make your life turn out to be \nexactly as you hope or very different from what you intend.\u201d And, most of all: \n\u201cDecide what you stand for. And then stand for it all the time.\u201d Perhaps the \ntech industry does not deserve the kind and good advice that Professor \nChristensen imparted, but it should take it anyway. That way, while he rests in \npeace, it could give us some, too. The Times is committed to publishing a \ndiversity of letters to the editor.

I\u2019ve had the opportunity to put questions, one on one, to the top\n diplomats of both the United States and Iran, in their respective capitals. \nIran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, spoke to me on Jan. 7 in Tehran. Secretary\n of State Mike Pompeo spoke to me last Friday, in Washington. Each man \nrepresents a nation in conflict with the other; speaking with them, I wondered \nwhat path either could see out of the situation. In both cases, I was allotted \n10 minutes for questions. It turns out you can cover a lot of ground in 10 \nminutes. When Mr. Zarif sat down with me, on the sidelines of a big think tank \nconference focused on security in the Persian Gulf, it was just four days after \nan American drone strike had killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. We started \nthere. How might Iran retaliate for General Suleimani\u2019s death? \u201cThe United \nStates has committed a grave error,\u201d Mr. Zarif told me. \u201cAnd it will pay for \nthat grave error.\u201d I do not know whether, at that moment, he was aware that just\n hours later, Iran would unleash missiles on Iraqi military bases where American\n troops are housed. We moved on to whether he would travel to New York later \nthat week, to attend Security Council meetings at the United Nations. \u201cNo,\u201d he \ntold me, \u201cbecause Mike Pompeo decided I was too dangerous for the United \nStates.\u201d The United States had denied Mr. Zarif a visa, in what some have \nbranded a violation of the 1947 United Nations headquarters agreement, which \ngenerally requires the United States to grant access to the United Nations for \nforeign diplomats. Next I asked whether we were witnessing the death of the 2015\n nuclear deal. Mr. Zarif insisted no \u2014 even as he acknowledged that Iran was \nsuspending compliance with centrifuge limits. The foreign minister and I ended \nwith a tense exchange on what is an uncomfortable question for him: The status \nof United States citizens imprisoned in Iran, and whether future prisoner \nexchanges were off the table. \u201cWe had proposed a universal exchange of all \nprisoners and we were doing that in good faith,\u201d Mr. Zarif said. But are those \nchannels still open? No, he conceded, saying, \u201cThose talks are certainly \nsuspended now.\u201d My interview with Secretary Pompeo came two weeks and three days\n later, in the East Hall of the Treaty Room, on the seventh floor of the State \nDepartment. By then an uneasy pause had taken hold; the United States and Iran \nappeared, for the moment, to have stepped back from the brink of war. I kicked \noff with a question on diplomacy. Is there any serious initiative underway to \nreopen diplomacy with Iran? \u201cWe\u2019ve been engaged in deep diplomatic efforts since\n the first day of the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Pompeo replied, underlining \nAmerican efforts to build a coalition to counter and contain Iran. But in terms \nof American engagement with Iran, I went on, are there any plans for talks? \u201cThe\n diplomatic effort on this front has been vigorous, robust and enormously \nsuccessful,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, changing the subject back to engaging American \nallies to put pressure on Iran. Another question I was curious to hear Secretary\n Pompeo answer was how the Trump administration plans to prevent Iran from \nbuilding nuclear weapons, should it decide to do so, given that Iran is closer \nto a nuclear weapons capability than when President Trump took office. Here\u2019s \nthe relevant portion of the interview: KELLY: How do you stop Iran from getting \na nuclear weapon? POMPEO: We\u2019ll stop them. KELLY: How? Sanctions? POMPEO: We\u2019ll \nstop them. He did not offer specifics. Nor did he elaborate, when pressed on how\n to square his resolve with what Mr. Zarif had just told me \u2014 that all limits on\n Iran\u2019s centrifuge program have been suspended. \u201cYeah,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cHe\u2019s \nblustering.\u201d Do you have evidence that he\u2019s blustering? He did not directly \nanswer. (In fairness, I could hardly expect him to telegraph what intelligence \nthe United States may possess on the Iranian regime\u2019s nuclear ambitions.) I \nwrite about all this now to refocus attention on the substance of the \ninterviews, which has been overshadowed by Mr. Pompeo\u2019s subsequently swearing at\n me, calling me a liar and challenging me to find Ukraine on an unmarked map. \nFor the record, I did. That\u2019s not the point. The point is that recently the risk\n of miscalculation \u2014 of two old adversaries misreading each other and \naccidentally escalating into armed confrontation \u2014 has felt very real. It occurs\n to me that swapping insults through interviews with journalists such as me \nmight, terrifyingly, be as close as the top diplomats of the United States and \nIran came to communicating this month. There is a reason that freedom of the \npress is enshrined in the Constitution. There is a reason it matters that people\n in positions of power \u2014 people charged with steering the foreign policy of \nentire nations \u2014 be held to account. The stakes are too high for their impulses \nand decisions not to be examined in as thoughtful and rigorous an interview as \nis possible. Journalists don\u2019t sit down with senior government officials in the \nservice of scoring political points. We do it in the service of asking tough \nquestions, on behalf of our fellow citizens. And then sharing the answers \u2014 or \nlack thereof \u2014 with the world.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Beware the Pandemic Panic Coronavirus is scary. How \nwe respond to it may be worse. By Farhad Manjoo Opinion Columnist Coronavirus is\n starting to freak me out \u2014 not the illness itself but the amped-up, ill-\nconsidered way our frightened world might respond to it. Yes, the novel virus \nappears to be spreading quickly at the outbreak\u2019s epicenter in the Chinese \nprovince of Hubei, but after a late start the Chinese government is now imposing\n unprecedented measures to contain it. As the World Health Organization declared\n last week, it remains too early to call the outbreak a global public health \nemergency. So far, the Wuhan coronavirus is not much more frightening than the \noutbreaks of other recent coronaviruses like SARS in 2003 or MERS in 2012, each \nof which killed fewer than a thousand people around the world. The new virus\u2019s \ndeath toll has just exceeded 130; for context, according to the CDC, about 15 \nmillion Americans have been sickened by the seasonal flu so far in the 2019-2020\n flu season, and 8,200 have died from it. (The flu kills between 300,000 and \n650,000 people around the world annually.) What worries me more than the new \ndisease is that fear of a vague and terrifying new illness might spiral into \npanic, and that it might be used to justify unnecessarily severe limits on \nmovement and on civil liberties, especially of racial and religious minorities \naround the world. I also worry that the online world may give rise to dangerous \nskepticism, and that in the event of an actual pandemic a large number of people\n may delay treatment or refuse vaccines because they don\u2019t believe the science \nor are suspicious of the government. \u201cI predict that the next major outbreak \u2014 \nwhether of a highly fatal strain of influenza or something else \u2014 will not be \ndue to a lack of preventive technologies,\u201d warned Heidi Larson, the director of \nthe Vaccine Confidence Project, in a 2018 article in the journal Nature. \n\u201cInstead, emotional contagion, digitally enabled, could erode trust in vaccines \nso much as to render them moot.\u201d Social media, she added, \u201cshould be recognized \nas a global public-health threat.\u201d Tech giants have been racing to tamp down \nconspiracy theories and hoaxes about the Wuhan virus, but I worry that their \nefforts won\u2019t be very successful, because society seems to have no good answer \nto the kind of emotional contagion Dr. Larson describes. It\u2019s not just that many\n people get their news from a medium given to rumor, exaggeration and wild \nmisinformation, especially on issues about health or science \u2014 see the \npersistence of antivaxers or climate-change deniers. There is also a growing \npartisan divide over how Americans interpret scientific expertise and health \npolicy, leaving decisions about public health vulnerable to the kind of partisan\n squabbling you hear on cable news every night. I also worry about the hair-\ntrigger state of geopolitics. From Donald Trump to Xi Jinping to Boris Johnson, \nstrongmen with authoritarian tendencies run many of the world\u2019s most powerful \ngovernments. It is worth remembering that disease, or the fear of disease, can \nbring out the worst in humanity \u2014 pandemics often feed scapegoating (Jews were \nwidely blamed for the Black Death), creating a fertile field for demagogues. \nWhen you put all these factors together, you\u2019ve got a dangerous recipe for \nglobal repression. Already, China\u2019s response appears to be driven by political \nconsiderations more than epidemiological ones. The government has imposed a \ntravel lockdown on more than 35 million people, which experts say is a \nquarantine of unprecedented size and scale, yet it may not even turn out to be \nvery effective. Experts say that quarantines work best during the earliest \nstages of an outbreak, but that they can also backfire, causing medical \nshortages, corroding trust in health officials and pushing some people to look \nto evade care to escape any restriction on their rights. China took weeks to \nmount a full-scale response to the virus. According to Wuhan\u2019s mayor, five \nmillion people left the city before restrictions were imposed, suggesting the \ncountry is effectively locking the barn door after the horse has run off. \n\u201cThey\u2019re doing it because people who are in political leadership always think \nthat if you do something dramatic and visible that you\u2019ll gain popular support,\u201d\n Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, \ntold The Washington Post. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have any sound public health advice.\u201d \nWe should keep this sense of caution in mind in case American politicians begin \npushing for travel bans, overbroad quarantines or other measures that might not \nbe supported by the science. You might wonder what the great harm is \u2014\u00a0if the \ngovernment needs to temporarily limit people\u2019s movements or prevent some people \nfrom entering the country, shouldn\u2019t it take those measures in the face of \ndangerous illness? Perhaps, but given the checkered history of quarantines \n\u2014\u00a0throughout history, they have been used to persecute the marginalized \u2014 \nlawmakers and the media should rigorously examine the bases for any such \nrestrictions. We should especially make sure any restrictions imposed are indeed\n temporary and adhere to the science \u2014\u00a0something we don\u2019t always do. Consider \nthat 30 years after the AIDS outbreak, men who have sex with men are still \nrestricted from donating blood in the United States, long after the scientific \nbasis for such a ban has passed. So far, President Trump has offered a measured \nresponse to the virus. \u201cWe have it totally under control,\u201d he said this week. \nBut online, misinformation about the scale of the virus is already trending. (It\n is not, as you might have read on Twitter, \u201cthermonuclear pandemic level bad.\u201d)\n So are racist memes blaming Chinese people and Chinese culture for the virus. I\n fear that the conditions are ripe for a situation similar to what occurred in \nthe summer of 2014, when an outbreak of Ebola overran West Africa. After the \nObama administration scrambled to bring home two American health workers who had\n become infected with the disease in Liberia, Trump went on a monthslong Twitter\n tirade about Ebola. The future president favored extreme isolationism, seeing \nno benefit to American help in Africa. \u201cPeople that go to far away places to \nhelp out are great-but must suffer the consequences!\u201d he wrote \u2014 ultimately \nsparking a growing partisan movement against the government\u2019s response to the \nvirus. Today, Trump runs an administration that is hemorrhaging scientific \nexpertise, and his political agenda is rife with efforts to target immigrants, \nminorities and the poor. In 2016, a terrorist attack prompted Trump to propose \nbanning Muslims from the country; when he won the White House, he instituted a \nversion of that ban. I fear that panic about a foreign virus offers society \nanother chance to target marginalized people. So let\u2019s keep our fear in check; \npanic will hurt us far more than it\u2019ll help.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by How the Iowa Caucuses Work A little bit of choice, a \nwhole lot of chaos. By Shirley Wang Ms. Wang is a freelance writer based in Iowa\n City. DAVENPORT, Iowa \u2014 \u201cSo if you\u2019re with pineapple the first round, and there\n are enough voters, do pineapples become viable and you can no longer change to \nblueberries?\u201d a man at the table near me asked. We were in a room full of \ntrainees for the Iowa presidential caucus that would occur in 19 days. People \narrived for the training session from all over the state; I had driven an hour \nfrom my hometown. The Iowa caucus is not a simple exercise \u2014 it requires 1,678 \ngyms, churches, libraries and schools across the state. Each location executes a\n complicated choreography in which hundreds of people migrate around a room to \naggregate in their candidate\u2019s corner. Their presence is their vote. At our \ntraining session at the Davenport Public Library, we practiced navigating the \nchaos by using fruits as stand-ins for the Democratic candidates. Each fruit \ncontender had its own display table, complete with produce props: oranges, \napples, blueberries and tomatoes. One table contained a pineapple, meant to \nrepresent undecided voters. During the caucus vote, there is a first round, \nwhere people walk around a large room and stand in their candidate\u2019s corner. \nThen, after everyone is tallied, candidates without a 15 percent of the total \nvoters present are swiftly removed from the caucus ballot. Their voters are \nforced to quickly pick another candidate. The community activist Maria \nBribriesco cued us to begin. At first, people gravitated toward the blueberries,\n which had enticed us with promises of edible samples. Ms. Bribriesco counted \neveryone. Tomatoes were out. People who clustered around the pineapple wanted to\n know if they could stand in the undecided corner in the first round of the \ncaucus and then choose a candidate during the second round. That way they could \nselect from a whittled-down slate. (If there are too many undecided people after\n the first round, caucus guidelines state that they can\u2019t leave the group). \nTwenty-five of the 35 people at the training session had been to an Iowa caucus,\n but even some of the more experienced ones were confused. A woman sitting next \nto me told me that she had been to the Democratic caucus in 2016, in which \nvoters chose between Hillary Clinton, Martin O\u2019Malley and Bernie Sanders. She \ncame back for the training, because \u201cyou forget,\u201d she said. There are so many \nrules, as well as new updates for 2020. Be in line before 7 p.m. or you won\u2019t be\n allowed to enter. Iowans had to preregister by mid-January if they wanted to \nvote in the caucus while out of state. Voters have to stay long enough to be \ncounted at the caucus, sometimes more than three hours. Fortunately, the \ntraining lasted only two and a half hours. \u201cWe set it up intentionally to be \nchaotic because this is going to happen,\u201d Ms. Bribriesco said. We had started \nthe evening with a practice run for the Republican caucus, in which voters mark \nwho they want to run as the official G.O.P. candidate, (this part was \nuneventful, and ended quickly). Then the other guide, Emiliano Martinez of the \nIowa Democrats, gave a slide show presentation that offered an overview of the \ncaucus. Each slide was full of lingo like \u201cviable,\u201d \u201clocking in\u201d and \n\u201calignment.\u201d Ms. Bribriesco said the hardest part is figuring out the math. \nPrecinct-specific calculations determine whether your candidate will get a \nstate-level delegate vote. Delegates then vote for that candidate at the \nDemocratic National Convention in July to determine the national party nominee. \nIf there are three delegates and 35 people in your precinct, how many people do \nyou need in your candidate\u2019s group to gain one of Iowa\u2019s 41 delegate votes? Mr. \nMartinez pulled out his phone to do the calculation while reassuring us that \nwhen the real caucus day came the precinct captains would check the numbers. As \nwe sat and tried to follow, the women around me discussed the rules. Are you \nallowed to leave in the middle of the caucus to go to the bathroom? What happens\n when there\u2019s a tie? (The answers to these questions were not clear). If you \ndon\u2019t know the math of how many voters each candidate needs to gain a delegate\u2019s\n vote, and you don\u2019t know which candidate you want, it\u2019s extremely difficult to \nbe strategic. \u201cBut if it\u2019s too much like a primary, we lose our first-in-the-\nnation status,\u201d Ms. Bribriesco said when I asked her if the Democratic caucus \nprocess needed to change. She spoke positively of it all despite the fact that \nthis year, the caucus site she will attend in Bettendorf will include 12 \nprecincts packed into the Quad Cities Waterfront Convention Center. Kathy Laird \nfrom Bettendorf (who happens to be Ms. Bribriesco\u2019s cousin) recalled that in \n2016, she had chosen Mr. O\u2019Malley during the first round but had to choose \nbetween Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Clinton after Mr. O\u2019Malley didn\u2019t gain enough voters\n and was ousted from the ballot. The four Iowans in the O\u2019Malley group were \nbombarded by supporters for the other candidates trying to convince them to \njoin. Usually, voters get around 15 minutes to decide. But things would be \ndifferent this year, with 12 candidates to choose from. She expects pure chaos \nto reign. In the last election cycle, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders were almost \nexactly matched \u2014 with the tip to Mrs. Clinton by a 0.3 percent margin \u2014 and in \nindividual precinct counts, numbers are rounded up and down to determine whether\n someone receives a delegate vote. How can we trust the Iowa indicator? Ms. \nBribriesco said that in 2016, getting a total head count for each candidate was \nlike \u201cherding cats.\u201d This year, at least, there are paper ballots to keep track \nof the number of people in each candidate\u2019s corner. This way, people whose \ncandidate moves on can leave after the first round; the paper becomes their \nplaceholder, and votes can\u2019t be changed after the second round. Some precincts, \nwe learned, would flip a coin or draw straws to break a tie. It was \ndisillusioning to hear that some delegate votes were left up to chance, given \nhow close the caucus was last time \u2014 even if now most people agree that the luck\n of the draw couldn\u2019t have changed the outcome of 2016. Two newcomers to the \nparty at the caucus training, the former registered Republican Dave Scott from \nBettendorf and his wife, want to beat President Trump, even if it means putting \na Democrat in the house. \u201cI still want to be in the process. If you don\u2019t vote \nyou have no say,\u201d he said. The Democratic caucus, to him, seems much more \nfrantic than the Republican one. Still, Mr. Scott wanted to be there. \u201cHow can \nyou complain if you didn\u2019t participate?\u201d he said. Shirley Wang (@shirleyshirlw) \nis a freelance writer based in Iowa City.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by What Will You Do When the Culture War Comes for You? \nNewsrooms still aren\u2019t ready for the trolls. By Charlie Warzel Mr. Warzel is an \nOpinion writer at large. The culture war will come for us all. On Sunday, it \ncame for a Washington Post reporter, Felicia Sonmez. Nine people were killed in \na helicopter crash in Calabasas, Calif., that morning, including the basketball \nlegend Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. The news rocketed \naround social media, where mourners shared their heartbreak at the news. As is \ncommon with major breaking news, some reports were inaccurate or false, layering\n anxiety on top of grief. Into the mix, Ms. Sonmez tweeted the link to a 2016 \narticle from The Daily Beast about a young woman\u2019s accusation that Mr. Bryant \nhad raped her in Colorado. Criminal charges against him were dropped in 2004 and\n a civil suit was settled out of court. The tweet highlighted the fact that Mr. \nBryant\u2019s legacy is fraught and complicated, and attracted the attention of fans \nas well as trolls who bombarded her inbox with abuse and posted her home address\n online. Ms. Sonmez then posted a selection of the threats she received, without\n obscuring the names of the people who had sent her hate mail. She slept in a \nhotel on Sunday night, fearing for her safety at home, she said. We don\u2019t know \nall the details, but it seems that The Post\u2019s managing and executive editors \nwere not pleased. They chastised her over email and placed her on administrative\n leave while the organization reviewed whether she had violated the company\u2019s \nsocial media guidelines. Their reasoning on Monday: \u201cThe tweets displayed poor \njudgment that undermined the work of her colleagues.\u201d The Post reversed her \nsuspension on Tuesday, roughly 36 hours after the initial tweets, stating that \nsenior managers had concluded that Ms. Sonmez\u2019s tweets didn\u2019t violate company \npolicy. This, of course, was obvious to almost everyone but The Post\u2019s higher-\nups. It was impossible to imagine how posting a link to a story by a different \npublication on Twitter could undermine the work of colleagues. Just as it was \nimpossible to imagine which colleagues would have felt undermined (more than 300\n of Ms. Sonmez\u2019s colleagues expressed solidarity with her in a letter from The \nPost\u2019s union to management). There remain glaring questions. Did the executive \neditor, Marty Baron, inquire about Ms. Sonmez\u2019s safety when he emailed her to \ncriticize her tweets? What, beyond a reflex for online civility, led The Post to\n determine the reporter was \u201churting this institution\u201d by discussing a part of \nMr. Bryant\u2019s legacy that appeared in The Post\u2019s own news pages? Why, after years\n of watching journalists, women and vulnerable individuals being trolled and \nabused by viral outrage online, are newsrooms still falling for the same \nGamergate-style tactics? The Post\u2019s official statement (it doesn\u2019t quite rise to\n the level of an apology), which included the caveat \u201cwe consistently urge \nrestraint\u201d for reporters online, doesn\u2019t begin to answer these questions. Mr. \nBaron released a memo to Post staff on Thursday admitting \u201cIt is not always easy\n to know where to draw the line\u201d on many of these issues. Notably, the memo did \nnot include an apology. The incident also raises headier questions, including: \nIn the world of online journalism, what specifically do writers owe to their \npublications via their social media presence? Surely, there\u2019s a bare minimum if \nthey\u2019re collecting a paycheck. Journalists obviously shouldn\u2019t undermine their \ncolleagues with cheap shots or reckless speculation as to others\u2019 work. They \nshould stay professional. After that, things get murky. Twitter is a Gordian \nknot of news and opinion that can\u2019t be untangled. Inside publications, news and \nopinion bleed together; opinion writers report while reporters opine via news \nanalysis. Partisan commentary, once a third rail for objective reporters, is \nomnipresent on Twitter. In the past, news organizations \u2014 and the people who \nwork for them \u2014 would never have called the president a racist. Some now do so \nexplicitly. Newsrooms and even the platforms have struggled with finding a new \nstandard in the Trump era of disinformation; meanwhile, journalists are expected\n to sort it out in real time, while on the job. And to get it right or face \nconsequences. Journalists who build followings online, in part by being \nincisive, combative, funny and omnipresent on Twitter, are often hired because \nof that exposure \u2014 because they\u2019re a known quantity. At a larger organization, \nthough, those same attributes may quickly be seen as a liability. Publications \nhire diverse outspoken writers and then get anxious when these writers start \ntweeting about politics. Some outlets ask staffers who don\u2019t cover incendiary \nbeats like politics to refrain from commenting on political goings-on. But what \nhappens when politics touches everything? For those who\u2019ve made a name being \noutspoken, suddenly saying nothing is a statement in itself. For newsroom \nleaders the questions get tough, fast. Few if any outlets seem to want to draw \nexact lines. And so they become blurred. There\u2019s also a double standard. While \nfew publications would say it, it\u2019s all but required for young journalists to \njump into the culture war online. It\u2019s a way to find stories. And in a volatile \nindustry it gets you noticed. Being \u201cpart of the discourse\u201d each day means being\n marketable. It helps writers, but it also bolsters publications, helping \npromote big stories and creating all kinds of dystopian forms of content like \n\u201cmicroscoops,\u201d or breaking news too small to merit its own article but enough to\n tout to competitors on Twitter. This exposure is a drug for journalists. The \nreal-time sparring and feedback is seductive, and the endorphin boosts of \nconstant mentions is addictive. But it\u2019s also exposure in the truest sense: \ngreat visibility and great vulnerability blended seamlessly together. Though an \nargument could be made that all the time-wasting, in-jokes and gaffes from idle \nreporters and editors on Twitter subtly undermine the rigorous parts of the \nwork, newsrooms benefit greatly from the constant exposure of their journalists.\n Reporters use Twitter to poke and prod sources. Writers sometimes enhance their\n stories with long tweet threads that explain the reporting process. And \nreporters build trust with audiences by including or signaling to their audience\n perspectives in their online analysis (Ms. Sonmez, who has come forward with \ndetails of her own sexual assault, told her colleague Erik Wemple that her \ntweets were, in part, to make survivors like herself who follow her feel seen). \nWhen important news breaks, newsrooms claim credit when their reporters break it\n first on Twitter. Which is why The Post\u2019s statement, especially its urging of \nrestraint, is so fraught. The same editors who want restraint from reporters \nonline during a celebrity death would most likely also be furious if their \nCapitol Hill reporters were slow in live-tweeting a hearing or impeachment \nproceeding and fell behind the competition. Restraint is a virtue in journalism,\n no doubt, but so are tenacity and transparency. The message is contradictory: \nBroadcast everything, but exercise restraint. Twitter isn\u2019t real life, but \ntweets can and will get you fired or suspended. But these qualities have been in\n conflict and competition for long before Twitter and newsrooms understood a \njournalist's exposure during breaking news and had their backs accordingly. \nEvidence suggests that\u2019s not always the case in the face of a cascade of online \noutrage. That\u2019s less a change in the industry than it is a failure of newsroom \nleaders to understand the information war it sends its journalists out to fight \nin each day. While the internet\u2019s culture war dynamics are fraught, they\u2019re not \nall that hard to understand. They come in the form of intimidation and threats \ntoward journalists and angry campaigns toward advertisers and executives. Some \nof the responses are posturing and some are real, but all are engineered for \nmaximum virality and outrage. Yes, sometimes journalists make mistakes. \nSometimes work will harm the institution or undermine co-workers, but newsroom \nleaders ought to be trained to distinguish trolls from good-faith criticism. \nIt\u2019s a weird moment that newsrooms aren\u2019t talking about enough. Just as social \nmedia platforms allow celebrities, politicians and influencers to circumvent \ntraditional press gatekeeping, the same thing has happened to journalism\u2019s own \npractitioners. Despite all the social media guidelines, there\u2019s an unanswered \nquestion: Who do those followers really belong to? Perhaps it\u2019s most accurate to\n say they\u2019re an asset and a liability for both parties. Everyone\u2019s exposed. But \nthere\u2019s an asymmetry to that exposure. The culture war will come for us all, \ninstitutions and individuals alike. One group can weather the storm, the other \nneeds protection. Newsrooms need to get smart, prepare and protect their foot \nsoldiers. It\u2019s the least they can do. The Times is committed to publishing a \ndiversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by How Much of Harvard\u2019s $40 Billion Endowment Is \nInvested in Fossil Fuels? It\u2019s not all that important. Any amount is too much. \nBy Devi Lockwood Ms. Lockwood, a member of the Harvard class of 2014, is a \nfellow in the Times Opinion section. In my senior year at Harvard, I was invited\n to a dinner in honor of the writer Margaret Atwood, the recipient of the 2014 \nHarvard Arts Medal. On my way out the door I lingered, shrugged on my coat, took\n a deep breath and walked up to the university\u2019s president at the time, Drew \nGilpin Faust. We had met twice: once during her office hours and at an ice cream\n social. \u201cPlease divest from fossil fuels,\u201d I said, hoping to catch her off \nguard. The president, at first seemingly happy to see me, rearranged her face. \nHer shoulders crept up toward her ears. \u201cYou students don\u2019t understand \ninvestments,\u201d she said. Then she walked out of the room. I have benefited \nimmeasurably from Harvard\u2019s investments in me. But recognizing where some of \nHarvard\u2019s $40 billion endowment is invested was a cause of growing unease for me\n and some of my classmates. Students at other campuses were similarly concerned \nabout the endowments of their schools. Figuring out exactly how much of \nHarvard\u2019s endowment is invested in oil, gas and coal companies is a near-\nimpossible task. Harvard is required to disclose only direct investments in \nwhich the university owns shares of a specific company. Harvard says its direct \ninvestments amounted to $394 million as of May 2019, or roughly 1 percent of the\n endowment total. Divest Harvard, a student group, determined that of that \napproximate amount, $5.6 million was invested in companies that produce or own \nreserves of oil, natural gas and coal, and large electric utilities powered by \nnatural gas and coal. Harvard doesn\u2019t comment on its individual investments. But\n in 2015, the South Pole Group, a carbon finance consultant in Zurich, analyzed \n$989 million of Harvard\u2019s then $36.4 billion endowment at the request of Divest \nHarvard and 350.org. Based on those investments, the group estimated that the \noverall endowment was responsible for annual emissions of 11 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide, roughly equivalent to the annual emissions from Delaware. It\u2019s \neasy to get bogged down in the numbers, but the exact amount of Harvard\u2019s fossil\n fuel investments or the emissions it is responsible for isn\u2019t all that \nimportant. As the world faces a climate crisis, any amount of investment in \ncompanies that extract or burn fossil fuels is too much, especially by one of \nthe world\u2019s leading universities. Lawrence Bacow, the university\u2019s current \npresident, explained in the Harvard Gazette last fall that rather than divest, \nthe university believes that \u201cengaging with industry to confront the challenge \nof climate change is ultimately a sounder and more effective approach for our \nuniversity.\u201d But many students have not been content with that approach. As part\n of a divestment campaign, in May 2014 an undergraduate, Brett Roche, was \narrested by Harvard University police for blocking an entrance to Massachusetts \nHall, where President Faust and members of the administration had their offices.\n In April 2015, during Harvard Heat Week, students, faculty, alumni and \ncommunity members blockaded President Faust\u2019s office once more. Last November, \nat the Harvard-Yale football game, climate change protesters stormed the field \nat half time, delaying the game for roughly an hour. To date, 532 faculty \nmembers have signed a petition in favor of divestment from fossil fuels. The \nresult? Nothing has happened. Other campuses have had more luck. After pressure \nfrom student groups, Stanford announced in 2014 that it would not make direct \ninvestments in publicly traded companies whose principal business is coal \nmining. The University of Maine followed suit in 2015, divesting all direct \nholdings from coal companies. In 2017, Columbia University announced divestment \nfrom producers of coal burned to generate electricity. Other schools have taken \nadditional steps, divesting not only from coal producers, but also from oil and \ngas companies. These include Sterling College in 2013; the University of Hawaii,\n University of Dayton, Syracuse University and the Rhode Island School of Design\n in 2015; and the University of Oregon in 2016. The University of California \nsystem announced last September that it would divest $13 billion of its $83 \nbillion endowment and $70 billion of pensions from fossil fuel producers. \nRecognizing that student activism hasn\u2019t worked on its own, two Harvard College \nalumni from the class of 2018, Danielle Strasburger and Nath\u00e1n Goldberg started \nthinking about the Harvard Board of Overseers election. Last year, they founded \nHarvard Forward, an alumni-run organization that aims to elect five recently \ngraduated candidates to the board. The Board of Overseers mostly advises the \nuniversity on strategic decisions, though it does have the power to consent to \nthe election of members to the Harvard Corporation. The average age of the five \ncandidates is 28 \u2014 the same number of years that, on average, have passed since \nthe current overseers were Harvard students. Their platform includes: \u201cComplete \nand swift divestment of all university assets from fossil fuels.\u201d The board is \ncomposed of 30 Harvard alumni who sit for six-year terms. Each year in April, \nfive new members are voted in by alumni. A nomination committee of the Harvard \nAlumni Association generally chooses eight candidates who will be added to the \nslate. There\u2019s another way in, though \u2014 though a petition process. To qualify, \neach candidate needs 2,936 signed nomination forms, equivalent to 1 percent of \neligible voters (living Harvard alumni, with the exception of current \nprofessors, administrators and staff). The first test will come on Feb. 1, the \ndeadline to qualify for the ballot. When we spoke last week, Ms. Strasburger \nestimated that between 2,300 and 2,400 nomination forms had already been signed \nin favor of each candidate. They are nearly there. This is not just about \nHarvard. And it\u2019s also not just about whether you think divestment is a strategy\n that is worth pursuing, or whether it has an impact. Rather, Harvard Forward is\n a model for building power by young people \u2014 of breaking the logjam within \nlarge institutions and making change happen. This approach is not new. From 1985\n to 1991, Harvard and Radcliffe Alumni/ae Against Apartheid campaigned for \nHarvard to divest its stock in companies operating in South Africa. The \norganization used the same nominate-by-petition system to elect four members to \nthe board, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who stated that he would return \nhis honorary degree unless Harvard divested entirely from South Africa. By the \n1980s, Harvard did. Younger alumni realized then that they needed a seat at the \ndecision making table to create change. That is exactly what Harvard Forward is \nseeking. On Jan. 15, Harvard Global Networking Night, over 100 volunteers for \nHarvard Forward \u2014 many of them alumni from the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s \u2014 attended \n50 alumni events in 20 states and 20 countries with petitions in hand. That \nnight alone, they gathered over 1,000 signatures. Alumni can submit petitions to\n nominate the younger slate of candidates until the deadline on Saturday at 5 \np.m. Harvard Forward has volunteers in 35 cities to collect forms at signature \nparties this week. \u201cA lot of people want to know how they can make an impact \nwhen it comes to climate,\u201d Ms. Strasburger told me. \u201cIf you have a chance to \ninfluence a $40 billion endowment, that\u2019s a pretty big deal.\u201d Devi Lockwood \n(@devi_lockwood), a fellow in the Times Opinion section, is writing a book about\n water and climate change.
