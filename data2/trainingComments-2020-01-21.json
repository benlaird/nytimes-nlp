To be clear, I\u2019m not a Biden supporter (Warren 46 all the way!), but to hear the national front runner express such hubris was equivalent to thousands of canaries in a coal mine.",

But with Trump abandoning the Kurds and handing Syria over to Russia and then killing Soleimani, we need to know what each candidate thinks the right plan is for America for our continued intervention in the region. They need to justify the massive budgets for the military, and to clearly define how they would act as Commander in Chief to protect American interests worldwide. They need to articulate how America would view NATO and a revival of the Iranian nuclear deal, and how they would finally and forever defeat ISIS. They need to describe how they would repair the damage with Iranian relations that Trump's confront and contain strategy has caused. They need to define how to end the cyberwar we're currently in with Russia, and to get them to stop actions like this against our country. In general, they need to say how they would reestablish normalcy and stability in our foreign relations.\n\nThere are many more national security issues they need to address, but I didn't hear anything about them in the Times' interviews. Neither Warren nor Klobuchar is qualified to be CiC, and that needed to be highlighted. The Times needs someone more experienced in these issues on your Board before you go into your next round of candidate questioning.",

The letter supporting Elizabeth Warren most closely expressed my views.  Nice to read positive remarks here about Warren by AK, who seemed to have extra helpings of journalistic skepticism towards Warren in the segments of the interview shown in the TV program.  Her write-up of the endorsement seemed to lean towards Klobuchar.  \n\nSomeone, forget who (AK?), pointed out that Warren can come across as condescending and didactic.  Very true.  Big liability.  Same quality (perception of it, anyway) hurt Hillary, I think.  Obama too, though not fatally. It's a real problem these days, with tons of people drunk on faux feelings of persecution by those they perceive to be 'elitist' know-it-alls.  Most people, I think, admire brains, if they're not put forward condescendingly and if they're paired with genuine empathy, real respect for us non-brainiacs, and readiness to admit flaws and laugh at oneself.\n\nOne significance of the endorsement is its rejection of the notion that a woman can't win.  Bravo. Completely agree!  Make the election, at least in part, a referendum on sexism with Donald Trump representing the male privilege position.  See what happens.",

The same can be said for any number of thinkers who are not nationally, or sometimes even locally, known, but whose analyses and viewpoints are as sophisticated and worthy of deliberation as any that come from think tanks, universities, corporate conferences, or legislative houses.  (I daresay some even are found in Times' commentary boxes.)   \n\nIt's just that for a lot of such people the need to disseminate these ideas far and wide, and be famous doing so, doesn't necessarily become an overriding obsession; they have lives and families and careers in other areas that take up their time.  (A lot of them are also rightly rather suspicious of the social media echo chamber.)\n\nBut, even if they never achieve pundit status, their ideas are certainly worth a discussion by those who DO wander in those circles.",

You are carrying the mantle for the DAVOS crowd.\n\nIt's the facts behind the truth that impact people that matter most!  \n\n Let's take an accounting on facts that matter most:\n\n1. Biden lead the Democratic Push for the most disastrous financial bill for working people to benefit TBTF banks.  He championed the agenda of Wall Street with the \"Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act\", which makes it nearly impossible for average Americans to claim bankruptcy for anything unless they are destitute.  It's worse than that if you dig into it, which you won't.  It has turned America into a debt slave nation after 2008.\n\n2. Biden fully backed the Iraq war.  By some estimates a million civilians died and we left a legacy of spent uranium shells and an infrastructure that has never been rebuilt.  \n\n3. Joe Biden was the ring leader of the so-called \"War on Drugs\" that put millions of black men in jail and was a continuation of Jim Crow and the continuing racial injustice in our criminal \"injustice\" system, which continues a massively disproportionate number of Black prisoners.",

Tad Devine, a long-time Democratic strategist, was Sander's chief strategist in 2016, and his firm was paid millions of dollars, of course. That's what consultants do, rake in the cash. \n\nIt's never enough, either. Tad Devine also worked for Paul Manafort, and testified at his federal trial, for work in Ukraine to elect Victor Yanukovych in 2010. He also wanted to keep working with Manafort and Rick Gates in Ukraine in 2014. Pretty swampy connection with Bernie, I would say. And now, oh, no! His company has now jumped to working on the Yang campaign. \n\nSo my primary issue this election cycle is anti-corruption, and I'm sorry, Bernie's not it. Nor is Yang, which is too bad, because I kind of liked some of his policies.",

Second, there's already a buzz about Sanders being anti-Semitic and Krugman is able to unconsciously play with that association.  Third, rather than inquire more deeply about the division of labor between staffers and candidates, Krugman just goes for an incendiary soundbite.\nFinally, Krugman suggests that it is Sanders himself who is \"lying about a rival\" because the word rival in the context of the subheading suggests a single person.  In contrast, Krugman only can document or try to document lies by Sanders staff and not the candidate himself.  This too is quite unfortunate.",

So what Biden likely means is \u201cyes, Ryan is crazy to suggest we dismantle benefits to pay for tax cuts, but we could still strip them from people who don\u2019t need it ao it can be paid for by a progressive tax code.\u201d It is naive to think that, just because Biden is suggesting a cut only for privileged people, that this does not constitute a cut.

So if attacking the welfare state is the norm at the time he will do so, if arguing for the need of cuts to social security benefits is what the political establishment believes he will support that argument, if going to war in Iraq is the Washington consensus he will vote for it, if neo-liberal economic policies are in vogue he will defend them, if economic inequality becomes a central issue in political discussions he will at least pay lip service to it\u2026 The role of a presidential candidate is to articulate a vision, an agenda, a set of priorities, regardless of whether her or his positions are\u00a0\u201cpopular\u201d or aceptable to the punditry or the political establishment. Only with such programmatic clarity can a president lead in debates about how to tackle the central problems of our time.

This is bad; it is, indeed, almost Trumpian.\"\n\nCalling Sanders \"Trumpain\" discredits PK and the NYTs in the first paragraph. The article goes on to accuse Sanders of the same thing Warren has done - Biden's stand on SS - yet where do we see Warren in this story - o yah the NYTs endorsed her. \n\n\"I don\u2019t want to go overboard here. While there is a Trumpian feel to some of what we\u2019re seeing from the Sanders campaign, Bernie Sanders is no Donald Trump.\"\n\nThis language is extreme, not overboard. There is nothing about Bernie that is \"Trumpian\". They are entirely opposite people and candidates. Drawing that comparison discredits the NYTs and PK. They should both apologies to Sanders. \n\nWhile it's important to call out falsehoods, the comments written here and Warren's agreement with Bernie's claim of Biden on SS show signs that this article maybe entirely misplaced.\n\nIn the end this poorly written peice is only helping Trump to another 4 years. Nearly every poll shows Sanders beating Trump. Dissuading voters against Sanders with Trump comparisons is low. Shame on you PK and NYTs.",

Voters are suppose to take that seriously and vote against Bernie - is that the idea for this article? \n\nThe NYTs is playing a very dangerous game just as it did in 2016 claiming Hillary would win by 85% in the run up to election day. \n\nJudging from the comments here - there appear to be a lot of questions concerning the accuracy of this accusation on top of the Trump / Sanders comparison. I believe PK and the NYTs owe Sanders an apology. Sanders and Trump are polar opposites. There is no comparison. I find that far more disturbing than the SS accusation. The NYTs obviously has an agenda.",

He sends messages while always retaining \"plausible deniability.\" And that's the case with his Social Security denial.\n\nFor example, Biden has supported a compromise deal with GOP senators. While he didn't personally call for cuts in Social Security, they did.\n\nOf course Joe will claim that the \"deal\" wasn't finalized so he wasn't actually calling for a cut. But he was sending signals that he was willing to put a SSI cut on the table.\n\nBut that's not Biden's real problem. A French investigative journalist has looked into the Hunter Biden issue. While he did not find anything \"illegal\", at least not on Biden's side, he did uncover a sleaze factor of enormous proportions and several lies by Biden about what was really going on in that deal. \n\nSadly, you won't read this story in the NYTimes.

But there is method in the madness that has allowed this angry, aging, divisive, troglodyte his time in the limelight with the curtain set to come down. He rouses the na\u00efve youth and stirs up selfish excess, promising power and control, but only his way. As such, it is good to a point as he energizes the electorate, but like in 2016 when he cost Hilary the election, enough is enough, and now it is time to squelch this momentum before it does more damage to the other candidates seeking the nomination.\n \nWith the NY Times endorsement revealed, columnists must now get in line and Bernie Sanders must be trumped by Biden who appears to be the lead candidate to get the Democrat nomination. Bye, bye Bernie. Thanks for stirring the pot; now please go away quietly. Your time will never come.",

Hillary Clinton is blaming Sanders for her loss, instead of looking introspectively at herself and her campaign.  I believe it\u2019s fairly common knowledge that Deborah Wasserman Schultz and the DNC we\u2019re actively working for a Clinton nomination at the expense of a Sanders nomination.  I do not believe that Warren is corrupt, but she is a \u201cdyed in the wool\u201d capitalist. Very few Americans, especially the media and corporations, want to admit that capitalism is the cause of our environmental problems and social inequality problems.  Sanders recognizes this and is getting hammered for it.  And, of course, the NYTimes is also putting their thumb on the scales for an anybody but Sanders nomination.",

But the thoughtful, educated readers who spend the time to comment and offer links to back up their assertions are just as important to this reader as many of the Times' journalists. \n\nIn the case of this article, I have learned about Senator Biden's long record of advocating for \"adjustments\" to Social Security, and it gives me pause. Additionally, I'd like to propose that if Biden wins the Democratic nomination, Putin will release the emails hacked from Burisma, along with some counterfeits written by GRU operatives, to discredit the senator. It's something we might want to be prepared for. \n\nI'm a passionate Warren supporter due to her determination to fight corruption, so of course I have disagreements with the positions Senator Biden currently holds. And I certainly worry about the firmness of his convictions. All this said, however, for love of my country, and in an effort to give CPR to democracy, in 2020 I'll vote blue, no matter who. \n\nThank you, Professor Krugman, and thank you, NYT thoughtful commenters.\n\nkrw 1/21/20",

But the extreme rabidness of his followers, and that Bernie seems to be OK with it, has completely turned me around. I now view his candidacy as dangerous.\n\nIn addition in addition to being concerned about who can get elected, we should also be concerned about who can govern.  While I might agree with a progressive 90% of the time (which is still not good enough for the Bernie folks), I doubt Bernie or Warren can get 10% of their goals enacted. They will immediately be painted as failed presidents like Carter or Obama. (I don't believe that to be true, but it will be said). \n\nFor that reason I am gravitating toward Bloomberg.

That seemed vicious and completely out of proportion with his supposed wrong. I remember clearly when Bernie, in his first debate with Hilary, started out by defending her from the endless email \"investigation\" and saying she would make a great president. That is the Bernie I know. \n        It seems again and again that the Democratic Party is afraid of their own voters. They want to steer us away from Bernie, as if we are children, because they are afraid he will not win, or because they are afraid of our country becoming even more divided between the kind of photo-fascist/communist schisms that have historically led to world wars.\n         Bernie is reasonable, compassionate, well-spoken and wise. His followers and campaigners? Not so much sometimes. However, no candidate is perfect, and Bernie has a lot to offer America. He can win. I hope he does.",

He voted for a balanced budget amendment while failing to shield Social Security from such an amendment. When he last ran for president, he demanded that Social Security be \"put on the table.\" Biden's vice presidential chief of staff from 2011 to 2013 was executive director of the Bowles-Simpson commission, which proposed increases in the retirement age. Mr. Krugman certainly understands that such an increase would amount to a cut in Social Security. Thirty years of floating ways to cut Social Security. \n\nAll of this is in David Dayen's essay.

By this view, these expensive social programs are dragging down the economy, and they will have to be trimmed to deal with excessive borrowing. It's part of a centrist deficit scold ideology that views responsible politics as forcing the American people to drink their tough medicine so we can make the economy grow.\n\n...\n\nSo Biden was mocking Ryan for trying to cannibalize Social Security and Medicare to pay for his tax cuts, but in the process Biden endorsed his usual line that we need to cut these programs at least somewhat to make them solvent over the long term and keep down the deficit. \"I don't know a whole lot of people in the top one-tenth of 1 percent or the top 1 percent who are relying on Social Security when they retire\" clearly implies that benefits for those people could be cut without harming them. Saying that Biden lauded Ryan for doing so is arguably an exaggeration, but he absolutely did say cuts should happen.\"\n\n<a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/888689/joe-bidens-history-austerity\" target=\"_blank\">https://theweek.com/articles/888689/joe-bidens-history-austerity</a>",

Also, one could argue that Biden became Obama's VP because he was Wall Street's pick. That said, Sanders, who I fully supported in 2016, has lost his way, so I have walked away from his camp. \n\nMoving on, Biden likes to say he is blue-collar because he grew up in Scranton, PA, and understands blue-collar issues. That is hard to swallow because Biden was 10 yrs. old when his father moved the family to Delaware. That said, at 71, I have grown somewhat tolerant of the malarkey common to most politicians, however, I draw line when a politician claims to be riding a no malarkey bus. \n\nTherefore, as 2020 approaches I am hopeful American voters will keep in mind something I read awhile ago: the first principle of voting is that you must not fool yourself  \u2014 and you are the easiest person to fool. \n\nMay the best woman win!",

But Sanders has a habit of being right about things. For example, the Times seemed to disparage Sanders claim that as president he would govern from the Bully Pulpit, using the ground swell of public support to overcome Republican obstruction. The Times did not regard this as an effective plan. But if a Democrat wins it is likely that they will have to do exactly that all the time because the Senate is corrupted. It will probably remain Republican and their Mc Connell obstruction plan will go into effect. My point. Driving Sanders away in various ways, squeezing him out with disparagements and accusations of dirty politics is not a good way to resolve the progressive dilemma.

If Biden is the nominee he will be attacked for this. Krugman and others are mistaken that they can keep these criticisms in the box forever.",

Sanders should stick to the facts, as you have laid them out, regarding Biden's willingness to allow cuts to Social Security and no need to embellish them or quote Biden out of context.  Of course, Krugman and NYT seem to have gone after Sanders and been team HRC in 2016 and now EW for 2020.  I think Sanders answered the NYT questions better than any of the other candidates and you can tell in that interview as well as this article that NYT has an underlying sense of disdain for Sanders and those who support him.  I was surprised to see that a CNN commentator said as much in regard to the NYT board endorsement and reference of candidate interviews.  Sanders campaigned for HRC even after being undermined by the DNC.  NYT should have given him props for that effort.  If you dismiss Sanders and his supporters the way in which happened in 2016, you just might get Trump re-elected after being impeached and declared guilty.",

The fact that Trump has never mentioned overspending and the national debt is that, like all scorched-earth despots, he's not going to hang around after his policies have sent the US economy into an nosedive that could well bring us The Great Depression 2.0.  Of course Bernie was NOT referring to Trump's trillions criminally squandered on the 1%, gifting the with deep tax cuts, stolen from the 99% in the greatest transfer of wealth in US history.  When the democrats transfer money from the 1% to the 99% for necessary social services and infrastructure along with other expenditures for what the 1% also make use of, they are mindful of the impact of their economic policies.  Take Bill Clinton's taxes on the rich that resulted in the largest government surpluses in modern times.  Speaking of whom, if Monica would only service Donald then the GOP would impeach.

Cheap shots about wine cave dinners, misleading claims about Sanders support for women and Sanders distortions of Biden's record have no place in Democratic politics.

As his numbers in Iowa increase, we are now \u201cfinding out\u201d that he is unliked, has \u201clied\u201d, and has so many other flaws.  It is incumbent on all of us to think critically about this sudden influx of information.  I worry sometimes that even our liberal media outlets and writers fear the kind of change they think Bernie will bring about. It may or may not happen, but all of us need to work a bit harder, to cut through the rhetoric and noise and make our best decisions in an educated and considered way.

Biden lead the Democratic Push for the most disastrous financial bill for the working and middle class when he championed all the Too Big To Fail Banks in the supporting the so called \"Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act\", which makes it nearly impossible for average Americans to claim bankruptcy for anything unless they are jobless, homeless, etc.  It's worse than that if you dig into it and giant banks used it to turn America into a debt slave nation.  The impact of these facts matter!\n\n2. Joe Biden backed the Iraq war whole heartedly.  By some estimates a million civillians died and we left a legacy of spent uranium shells and an infrastructure that has never been rebuilt.  The impact of these facts matter!\n\n3. Joe Biden was one of the ring leaders of the so-called \"War on Drugs\" that put millions of black men in jail and was a continuation of Jim Crow and the continuing racial injustice in our criminal \"injustice\" system, which continues a massively disproportionate number of blacks prisons.

Call it critical thinking, which Krugman, I think, calls \"hard thinking\".  What critical thinking tells me is that with Sanders pulling well among the folks on the ground, the pundits are pulling out the stoppers.  They fear the leftward shift from center.  They praise today's centrists.   But what is a centrist?  Does the word have the same meaning today as it did in 1985, when Ronald Reagan shifted center to the right?  Does it mean what it meant to those living under Eisenhower and Kennedy, when the working class was upward mobile and the tax rates on the wealthy were geared to equity?  I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an ugly edge to some of Sander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but enthusiastic voters seeing, as in 2016, the pundits of the upper middle class threatened by a straight talker.",

No wonder he is the favored candidate of the Democratic party establishment and its media.\nThere is NO way to underestimate the political intelligence of Americans.\n\nFor a better take: <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/13/biden-cuts-social-security\" target=\"_blank\">https://theintercept.com/2020/01/13/biden-cuts-social-security</a>/",

I'm concerned with his current views and existing plans for how to handle social security.

Hats off to her for having the intellectual honesty to notice the paradigm has shifted and adjust your bias accordingly.  \n\nOne of my main concerns with the Sanders campaign is that it seems to be based on a cult of personality.  Personally i find his positions to be on the correct path.  But it's easy to get attacked by the Sanders camp for merely expressing a minor difference in opinion.  His \"plans\" (which are rarely fully released) are assumed to be viable based on the fact that he said they are.   It's an article of faith.

These are americans  burdened by high housing costs, huge educational debts and working largely in a post industrial economy of contract work , where there are no provisions for employer pensions and there is little left over at the end of the month for saving.\n\nSocial Security has been painted as  a supplement to retirement savings but the reality for progressives is that at a time when there is such a maldistribution of both wealth and income, for many americans it is the only retirement support they have. Sanders and Biden both need not only to embrace medicare for all but also decent retirements for all , they must acknowledge the critical role Social Security is playing in peoples lives now and speak out loud , not about yesterday but about tomorrow and present a plan that reflects real current and future needs !",

Only after some tricksters on the left tried to start an equally unfounded rumor about McCain's eligibility to serve - a rumor which Obama held a press conference to quash and denounce within 24 hours of it gaining traction - only then did McCain have his now-famous town hall meeting where he defended Obama's citizenship. By then, it was too little, too late: birtherism had metastasized, and it would continue to chase Obama for years, eventually giving rise to the political career of Donald Trump.\n\nIronically, because one lie flourished while the other withered, McCain's halfhearted heroism is now remembered and lauded, while Obama's true case study in decisive leadership is forgotten. But at the time, it reflected poorly on McCain; it tarred him with the worst of his supporters, and may have pushed some swing voters toward the Obama camp.\n\nBernie Sanders would do well to remember this history when confronted with his worst supporters.

From 1996 to 2008 (except for a brief period in 2003), money flowed out net from the private sector because the federal deficit was less than the trade deficit.

But the result was not pretty. \n\nWhat was missing was a similar program to get money to the PEOPLE who had lost it. Obama's stimulus program was a joke.

Biden, a Delaware senator at the time, supported both moves. The heightened spending and reduced revenue focused public attention on the debt and deficit, giving fuel to a push for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\nBiden teamed up with Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to call for a freeze on federal spending, and insisted on including Social Security in that freeze, even as the Reagan administration fought to protect the program from cuts. \n\nBiden, like many \"blue dog\" democrats has always been in favor of \"grand bargains\" to cut or privatize Social Security and firmly opposed to solutions that would make it more secure, like raising the cap on deductions from the wealthiest. This \"smear piece\" on Sanders does nothing but make clear the position of the Times in defending a corrupt, inept conservative and his enmity toward the retired and the disabled.",

The video shows that Biden fully agreed with Paul Ryan, who immediately 'went after medicare and S.S. when he did the tax code' and admitted that they aren't otherwise financially viable (suggesting by whisper that tax revenues would need to increase). He clearly agrees with Ryan that these programs need to be 'adjusted to make room to pay for them'. It is unclear whether he supports reducing costs by denying these programs to the wealthy or other means that would include reducing services to the middle class. Biden admits to these wealthy Democrats that tax expenditures (1.3 trillion) are greatly wasted by the fed gov't and adds they should be socially 'constructive'. According to Biden, this can be achieved by supporting the middle class, using progressive tax codes, etc. to help drive the economy - a mild Keynesian approach, i.e. in addition to investors' inputs, wealth from the worker class is needed to fuel the economy.\n\nThis is about as progressive as Biden gets.

But our health care system will continue its disintegration and our foreign policy will swing from crisis to crisis, only now with better ambassadors working to keep control.\n\nSanders has consistently said that our system, as it is, needs fundamental change, or else any \"adjustment\" will be absorbed and made minuscule. His attitude about Biden therefore is consistent and reasonable, given his total perspective.\n\nI think Krugman here probably sees Sanders' point, and mostly agrees with it, but is afraid it is too radical for the electorate, and Trump would win against a Sanders candidacy. \n\nThat might be the case. None of us know for sure.\n\nWe are all scared about the future, and Krugman is no different than the rest of us.\n\nMy view is that I am going to step back from these differences, as important as they are, and try to get everyone to vote against Trump, no matter the opponent.

Biden is a walking amalgam of bad judgment and being on the opposite side of the little guy for pretty much his entire career. That's not what I'm looking for in a candidate. That he believes otherwise now only points to Biden's willingness to follow the voters, rather than lead them, just so he can be elected. Hmmm. Sounds a bit too familiar to me.

It highlighted a similar vein of pettiness that apparently makes his relationship with the press almost Trumpian. \n\nHe is, after all, a Democrat by convenience. He uses the DNC to be relevant. The moment he lost the 2016 primary, he quit being a Democrat and went back to being an Independent. Which left a bad taste in the mouth of many a Democrat like me. \n\nYet, having said all that, with a Frankenstein like Trump unleashed upon the country, and a Republican Party that's made his worst offenses probably un-impeachable, the country has clearly fallen into a grievously dangerous state of having been bought and paid for by a monied class that extends well beyond our borders. It's not just the Kochs, but the Saudis and the Russians who make policy. \n\nWe need a radical change. Sanders may be our last best hope.",

And as an election approaches, the smears come thick and fast. But I had hoped and fully expected that you would remain above the fray and simply give us the benefit of your views on the relative merits of the POLICIES of the warring candidates. So I am very disappointed.\n\nAs for the video, I doubt it was doctored, because it wasn't clear to me exactly whether Joe Biden was attacking or supporting Paul Ryan's proposal to cut Social Security. However, there is ample, documented evidence that Biden has been supportive of Social Security cuts for at least thirty years, and I would hesitate to interpret this video as Joe's Damascus moment. \nSo please let's forget the video and assess the merits of the policies that Biden is proposing in comparison to those of his rivals. But at the same time we should take into account his previous policy record on this and many other issues.",

It's often used as a campaign tool to appeal to voters. Some might say Warrens 200 dollar increase is buying votes, but I know better. It would have an extraordinary impact on the economy and health of millions struggling to pay to live. So why do the same political leaders change their tune to gloom after they are in office?\n\nThe political leaders gave us the gift and brilliance of \"Social Security\", but lose sight of that. As Warren seeks to expand Americans economics and health, her being an expert, why is Trump seeking to harm millions with a back door low blow to all?\n\nSocial Security should be utilized to improve lives and maintain the Tranquility.

What has he accomplished in his decades in office?

Sanders is not necessarily wrong about Biden's record on the topic: Biden definitely said in '95 that he supported freezing spending on entitlements; perhaps a reminder of a long lost time when political commitments to tackling the deficit were made in earnest. Senator Sanders -- who was in the House during this time -- almost certainly understands this. Though his political consistency is admirable, the lack of political integrity in publicizing this without properly understanding the context is more disappointing than anything. This sort of litmus test continues to threaten candidates by punishing actual legislative experience perhaps more palatable in their time, though this isn't a particularly new concept. But more importantly, it suggests that entitlement reform will continue to be the third rail of American politics: you touch it, you die.  The proposals already made by this Democratic field on social security threaten to bankrupt the trust fund at a faster rate than already anticipated. With the current trend looking at a full depletion by 2035, with a long and likely uncomfortable decline starting this year, at some point this will need to be addressed and I don't think either candidate is willing to do so.",

Of course, since none of his ideas have been put into place on a Federal level, there's really no way to evaluate them.  That's convenient.  It's one thing to say I am the loyal opposition.  It's quite another to lead and take responsibility for the errors you will undoubtedly make.  That includes smearing others.  I also fail to understand someone who so desperately wants the nomination of a party he refuses to join, or share his campaign contributions with.  However, he does want the benefit of the Dems' position as one of only two viable parties and their 230 years of tradition.  You really can't have it both ways.",

In that respect, the short American attention span can be very forgiving.\n\nAs for Biden, everyone knows he is the unchallenged apostle of conventional wisdom, and as conventional wisdom changes, so does he. He can certainly be criticized for his boundless sincere opportunism, but no one should pretend to be shocked or surprised by his lack of depth. It is both his bane and, alas, a major source of his centrist appeal.\n\nBuying into Ryan's \"tough budgetary realism\" talk on Social Security is neither the worst or most conspicuous of Biden's offenses. Anita Hill, Iraq and a long history of running interference for the credit card industry are all more inviting and consequential topics. So Sanders's strategic choice of targets does seem off the mark.",

This \"once upon a time\" is basically the past several decades up until Obama's second term. Centrist Democrats - Biden prominent among them - have banged the drum of cutting social security in the name of deficit reduction (and to shore up their Very Serious People bonafides). In fact, this was both Obama and Biden's position well into Obama's second term, when the White House was trying to strike a \"grand bargain\" with the GOP. \"Entitlement\" cuts were only abandoned by the Democrats when they finally realized that the GOP would not strike any deal with them no matter what. Centrist Dems didn't have a \"come to Jesus\" moment about Social Security.\n\nThe Sanders surrogate's actions were wrong, and Sanders to his credit has denounced them.

As was Barack Obama's. Their \"grand compromise\" with Republicans involved cutting the legally mandated increase in future spending for social entitlements.\n\nPaul, it's a habit of mind, not a time and place. And Joe Biden epitomizes it. Talk big and tough to your base, and after you get elected go in palms up to the Republican and ask them to be \"reasonable.\" Take what they offer (the government can keep running if you Democrats agree to cut future entitlements) and claim it was \"the best you can get.\"\n\nThe most moving moment for me in the recent NYT editorial board interviews was when Andrew Yang was asked who had broken his heart. He answered, \"Barack Obama.\" So much, so much left on the table, he said.\n\nI actually think you and I agree, Paul, that Elizabeth Warren would be the best Democratic candidate. But why carry water for the Democratic center by criticizing Sanders for exaggerating Joe Biden's sins, when you know full well that they were trying to criticize the habit of mind that he represents?",

To say otherwise is a big lie. \n\nOn this MLK day, I wondered whether he would have been a Trump Republican or a Biden Democrat. I think he would have been an Honest Abe Lincoln Republican like Sen Tim Scott of South Carolina celebrating religious freedoms of the Trump presidency as well as the historically low unemployment of the African Americans and most importantly the criminal justice reform that was previously ruining the lives of African Americans. MLK would have been speaking his mind very much like his niece Alveda King who does it nowadays.\n\nSanders is not just lying about his rival Biden but also he lying about a duly elected president Trump. Calling Trump a pathological liar when he is not is a big lie. Trump did lie when he made his promises, he worked very hard to keep them. Even when he said that Mexico will pay for the wall, he has made Mexico keep the asylum seekers until the hearing and he has kept the flow of central Americans from crossing through Mexico and so even though Mexico did not cut a check, they are indirectly helping secure the border and that is one reason the caravans are no longer marching into America and the tide of illegal entry has been stemmed. \n\nBiden and Sanders have been thrown under the bus by the NY Times edi board endorsements of the women Warren and Klobuchar.

Glad he\u2019s on board but I don\u2019t trust him on this issue when compared to various other candidates in the race, one of which has a 40 year history trying to expand social security. \n\nWhat I find most interesting is how the nyt, krugman & media writ large are spending so much time on what\u2019s really the first legitimate transgression of the Bernie campaign while completely ignoring the dozens upon dozens of times Biden has lied about Medicare for all - to pick one issue. Biden, on an almost daily basis, uses scare tactics by saying M4A will kick 150 million Americans off insurance. What he fails to mention is that they won\u2019t need it any more because they will be able to see any doctor they want, whenever they need too! In other words, to use krugmans analogy about mischaracterizing quotes, that would be like me saying Bernie wants 150 million to have no health care, when in fact his plan makes sure every American is covered.\n\nBiden\u2019s history of lying is substantially longer Bernie\u2019s. Just last week he said he opposed the Iraq war! It would be easier to take articles like this more seriously if they wrote them every time a centrist politician lied. Alas....",

Apparently The Times' Editorial Board shares his infatuation with its endorsement of Warren. (The double endorsement is I think a ruse as no one thinks Klobuchar is anything other than a Minnesota snowball that'll melt by Spring).\n\nTrump has buried America under so much filth even once honest brokers engage in subterfuge and sleight-of-hand albeit with the best of intentions.\n\nNewspaper endorsements usually get announced closer to election day.  So why the rush to judgment?  Why days before the Iowa caucuses? \n\nAll I can think of is how boring a Biden presidency might be for a commercial media that sees Trump as the gift that keeps on giving, the biggest bonanza ever for The Times, having just added its 5 millionth new subscriber.\n\nTrump demeans The Times as a failing newspaper despite being the main reason for its economic reprieve.\n\nDoes Biden really endanger The Times' Trump bump in circulation?

Why aren\u2019t we?\n\nAt least part of the blame rests with Bernie Sanders, who made Medicare for All both a progressive purity test and a bright shiny object chased by the news media at the expense of other policies that could greatly improve American lives, and are far more likely to become law.\"\n\nWhy does this newest column feel like more of the same?  Do us all a favor Mr. Krugman and stop bashing Sanders.  If you don't like him that's fine.  But, if what you say is true, that he smeared Biden, think about how much Biden smeared Anita Hill nearly 30 years ago and how much damage that did.  Politicians smear each other all the time.  You know that.  Why are you demanding an apology from Sanders and not an apology from Biden for what he did to ALL women who have ever been sexually harassed at work?  \n\n1/20/2020 first and hopefully only submit 9:10pm\nsecond submit 9:55pm",

Biden's soft cupidity should not be overlooked or excused. It has happened too often. Biden will shoot himself in the foot, it shouldn't be up to Bernie to do that, but he is right to remind us that BIden has never been a progressive, has been quick to fold, and is not the sword and shield we need at this moment. You, Dr. Krugman, were hard on Sanders in the last election, too Harder than you needed to be for such a popular force for good, however flawed",

Yes, there are strategies for avoiding depletion that do not require a cut in benefits, but I doubt there are enough Republican votes to solve this problem purely through various permutations of revenue increases. A bipartisan solution is going to be needed that will likely require some combination of increased payroll taxes and/or general fund transfers, an increase in the age for full benefits, and a change in the formula for computing cost of living increases.\nI think Sanders has the right vision for the United States, but as a practical matter, the moderates running for President would seem to be better positioned to cut a deal that will get the Republican support necessary to keep these funds solvent while minimizing benefit reductions, particularly for those who receive the lowest benefits.",

The Trump administration along with the GOP Congress actually adopted the chained-CPI formula that Obama-Biden had endorsed as part of their original budget deal with the Tea Party.  Biden's best possible defense at this point is just to state that he was wrong and that he will refuse to agree to any cuts or adjustments as part of presidential term.

He's spent this campaign season running on bipartisanship.\n\nGood luck getting out the vote on this platform on the heels of trillion dollar deficits, the tax scam bill, the syphoning of billions of dollars of congressionally approved funds to the border to commit crimes against humanity.\n\nThe electorate is done with triangulation. Cooperation with Republicans is now a liability.\n\nGo Bernie!",

If you're for cutting them, but don't want to take the heat that comes with saying so, you say they \"can stay,\" albeit with \"adjustments.\"\n\nEven the Politifact link in this article itself links to a Daily Banter post from 2019 which argues \"Biden is saying rich people don't need Social Security, and it's unfair they are receiving it when more vulnerable people need the money.\" So even people defending Biden on this point hear him as pushing means-testing Social Security, a popular initial offer from people whose ultimate goal is to hollow out the program or end it entirely.\n\nSocial Security's near-universality is the key to its enduring popularity. Everyone who works pays in, and almost everyone collects eventually. If you're for cutting benefits it pays out to anyone, you're for weakening it. And if you're not clearly advocating expansion, I assume you're in favor of its destruction.",

Throwing social security under the bus is one of those mistakes.\n\nKrugman's defense influences readers as the other half of the posters prove, but it more importantly serves a corporate run world.  Much of the progressive agenda that both Sanders and Warren support would eat away at corporate profits.\n\nShould Sanders publicly reign some of his staff in?  Maybe.  But it appears that as he garners more favor from the public, a variety of players are stepping up their attacks against his so called \"socialist\" agenda, the one that simply looks to even the playing field for all players.  Thank goodness for progressives like Sanders and Warren -- without push back from them, the rest of us won't have what we need to survive.\n\nThe problem with Neo-liberals is that they support progressive politics only to the point that it doesn't interfere with their own financial bottom line.",

On SS, his idea of a total freeze on government spending was so ludicrous that even Republicans didn't support it, yet he bragged about how he pushed it close to a half dozen times, never seeming to realize that the idea failed on it's substance and not on his lack of persuasion.\n\nIt's concerning that he was so steadfast in his wrong ideas and his current change of heart is much less convincing based on that attitude. I have no problem with compromise, but I do not believe that Joe Biden is the savvy negotiator that he claims to be. He has a long track record of getting rolled in the name of compromise and I would expect the same thing to happen now, especially because he thinks he'll have \"reasonable Republicans\" to work with upon election.

For Trump, this is most certainly true but his bubble as a 24/7 news channel all about his certitude. It's a pretty big bubble when you think about it. While one-sided, it is perhaps larger than the bubbles other presidents lived in. And Trump has also found a way to blow his own bubbles that somehow make it out of his own Fox-world bubble through the power of the Tweet.\n\nHere he can attack when it suits him and claim to be victim at other times. It is reminiscent of Nazi controlled Germany. The Nazis gave out free radios to Germans. This wasn't to uplift the German people through culture and music, it was to make certain that Goebbels and Hitler could get their message to masses. Lucky for Trump and Fox that their constituents already had smart phones. Either way, the parallels between the messages some 90 years ago and those of today, including victimhood, are still the same.\n\nThe saddest part of this is that Republican members of Congress have been so willing to goose-step with Trump.

But the real perpetrators of this betrayal of our Constitution are the 21st Century versions of Benedict Arnold's.  And it is not just Mitch McConnell who is throwing the rule of law and justice under the bus.  It is also every last Republican from Romney, Collins, and Gardner through Rubio et al. and right to, among the most egregious, Lindsey Graham.  His former friend McCain, rest his soul, proverbially must be rolling over in his grave witnessing the nadir into which his colleague has sunk.  All I can say is let us remember this.  Let us remember in November this travesty and mockery of all that is good and decent and moral.  Our country can not and will not sustain itself with Trump, his Cabinet, and his Republican sycophants contaminating the halls of Congress at the helm of a waning democracy.\"\n\nIt's time to get real serious  ---- Trump has no \"divine provenance\" which his white supremacist supporters want you to believe.",

The choice for them is a President Pence, running with a Vice President Nicky Haley against...Bernie? Biden?  Or a scrubbing of their ranks in the 2020 election, if Trump is allowed to carry on.  The turn out of outrage at this travesty in the Senate will expand into the next election in widening circles of consequence, for the GOP.  Should Trump be re-elected by an ill-informed and resentment driven fringe in a few key states, his legislative base of support will be gone.  Trump will be the only President impeached twice, and finally removed from office by a newly elected Senate of Democrats.  This is quite a gamble.  A few months with Pence speeding judicial appointments through the gate, in the countdown to an election day reckoning, and maybe a chance to remain in the Senate, after November.  Or, the coming generation will watch the depopulation of the GOP, as they are voted out of existence. \nMy message, Senators, is that history is forever. \nPerhaps you can save face, honor the Constitution and your oaths to protect it, by having an anonymous vote. All Senators promise to keep their votes secret, releasing each good conscience from the bonds of partisanship.\nTed Cruz memorized the Constitution as a teenager. How can he sit there in silence, the only other voice is his own inner dialogue, his knowing who and what Trump embodies, and not do what is right?",

I tried watching one of his more recent rallies in Dallas, in an effort to understand how he was processing what was happening to him, and framing it for his base.  The answer: there was no framing.  There was no explanation for his behavior, no response to accusations, no attempt at a legal defense or explanation, however basic.  No, his explanation was that the Democrats were \"evil\", \"crazy\", and want to destroy the nation, Trump and his supporters.\n\nIn a way I'm almost glad that we had someone like Trump at this moment in history, when his words and actions can be universally recorded and saved for posterity.  His cruelty and stupidity, and the way in which his party is mounting a know-nothing defense of the indefensible, will linger in the minds of up and coming voters for generations.  The young people growing up in this climate will be able to remember these days, and the fear and uncertainty that the Republican party introduced and condoned.  My hope is that a sham trial and failure to convict Trump is not a \"victory\" for the GOP, but the final nail in the coffin for their electoral chances for the next few decades.",

This was a person without any health care who was seeing his food stamp benefits cut.  Hos voting was based on a one superficial observation - clearly the man knew little about Trump.\n\nI vividly recall conversations with Trump supporters before the 2016 elections.  We were at a 4th of July party at a farm in upstate NY - a place devastated by plant closures where the 'best' jobs are working for NY State or a Federal Agency.\n\nMore than a few people were voting for Trump not because they thought he'd be a good President or because they thought he would help them or the country.  They were voting for Trump because they thought he'd 'burn Washington down'.   They were voting AGAINST decades of Washington DC making their lives harder.   They voted for Trump BECAUSE he was an outsider who talked about 'draining the swamp'.    They voted in support of a few slogans - nothing more.",

Thank goodness I didn't. I would have missed the highlight of the evening. Nadler lit up the chamber with fireworks, speaking the words that every one of us yearned to hear: plainspoken, naked truth, at last. And after Cipollone's unmemorable, huffing response, the icing on the cake:\n\nWe forget how rarely we hear the Chief Justice speak. Now we know how eloquent he is, how quietly powerful, and how true: a reminder of what we are hoping for.",

So we have no choice but to presume innocence.\"  Democrats could have gone ahead and voted against Kavanaugh on the basis of his position on abortion.\n\nBut instead Democrat after Democrat said Kavanaugh was \"unfit to serve.\"\n\nNow whenever Kavanaugh tries to speak he confronts placards declaring he is a rapist.\n\nIs this what Democrat's want?  In order for a Republican to be considered for the Supreme Court, he or she must be subject to an unfair process which presumes that he must be guilty.\n\nNeedless to say, it is payback time.\n\nThe Kavanaugh hearings made politics in the US even more divided.\n\nDemocrats should apologize to Kavanaugh.

            "comment_body": "Donald Trump's \"victimhood\" is what is so appealing to his supporters. He has told them that they're \"victims\" as well. \n\nTrump refuses to acknowledge the catastrophic damage he's caused to this country. He is willfully ignorant. And his racism stokes resentment among his white base. He tells them that all their failings are those brown peoples' fault. That those brown people took something away from them that was \"rightfully theirs.\" \n\nAnd this talk is like oxygen to Trump voters. Willfully ignorant and racist themselves, they refuse to acknowledge the role they've played in their own failures in life. They refuse to better themselves,  or to accept personal responsibility. They would rather tear everything apart in this country, and then throw tantrums. \n\nSound familiar? It should. Trump and his voters are mirror images of each other. They revel in their imagined victimhood. They believe that as white Christians, they are somehow \"persecuted\", that their \"rights\" are being violated. Now, of course, these claims are false. But like Trump, they love to hear lies.\n\nAnd so we are into the tens of thousands of lies Trump has made to date. And all of them are designed to stoke racism and bigotry, to let his voters continue to live in their fantasy world where they imagine themselves to be the \"victims\". \n\nBut understand this. Those of us who are people of color know who the real victims have been in this country. And it isn't Donald Trump, and it isn't his voters.",

Both sides have a collective responsibility for Trump's unholy \"gangsterization\" of the White House. Their policies and malpractice helped to spawn the Trump presidency. I just saw Senator Klobuchar express shock and surprise about the Republicans' rejection of calls for witnesses to testify at Trump's trial. A phony lamentation from the woman who repeatedly torments us about her so called bi-partisan achievements and instincts. So, I am not puzzled by the NYT editorial board collectively throwing their hands up in the air, then declaring that Klobuchar and Warren are the best choice. They avoided making the clear choice, when the choice is clearly Mrs Warren. After George HW Bush, the populace has no stomach for dynastic politics, or the usual phony suspects that Trump repeatedly trashed to win. He roundly whipped Cruz, and Rubio into  submission. Now, they are both Trump's cowering lap dogs. Democrats need an outsider, like Obama was an outsider. Democrats need the brashness of a Warren.",

It didn't happen in the '90's, but it's certainly happening now as overpopulation creates mass migration and starvation.\nThe amazing thing is that supporters can identify with this man.

Maybe some reported should ask Trump and posit a suggestion that if he really wants additional witnesses and documents then maybe he should \"indemnify\" any Republican Senator who calls for these additions to the Senate trial by vowing to NOT tweet against them or push for a Republican primary challenger if they hold out for what YOU have said you want. Let's see if Trump is really the big man he claims to be, or just the schoolyard bully who smears and demeans those who opposes him in order make himself look tough.

It is not too hard to imagine what they will say.  \"It is for the good of the Republic\" they will tell us as they reach for the handle and flush the constitution down the toilet bowl of time.",

He also stated that impeachment did not have to be about an actual crime for the president, it could be because of the president\u2019s actions were based on corrupt motives.\n\nCompare the actions of this president with those of President Clinton.  Clinton allowed himself to be interrogated by the Special Council (who is now part of Trump\u2019s defense team) under oath.  The Republicans, at the time, demanded that Clinton cooperate, which he did, to some extent, and the claim of perjury comes out of that (although there is a stronger legal defense for Clinton to have not actually committed perjury than there is for Trump\u2019s refusal to participate).\n\nThe majority of Republicans in Washington claim to follow the Christian god, but their actions show that they follow Janus, the two-faced god of the Romans, and Fraus, the Roman goddess of deceit and fraud.",

So now, when he is being held accountable for the first time in his life in a way that he cant either bribe or bankrupt his way out, he has been able to hijack an entire nation's political party to help him survive, to claim his innocence despite the majority in the country who follow his actions and who actually care about the future of the country's politics, healthcare and environment.  Yes, impeachment will remain a stain on  legacy, but even more will be the subjugation shown by the Republicans in Congress  as arm twisted by Mitch McConnell.  Will the country recover?  First, it depends on the outcome of the 2020 election, the ability to regain international respect, the guts to bring the deficit down, and the wisdom to start to tackle the huge problems confronting us...climate change, healthcare, education, infrastructure at the cost to huge funds given to the military.",

Trump should have produced documents and permitted witness testimony for the House, and McConnell committed a strategic error by preventing documents and witness testimony in the Senate trial. \n\nRepublicans could then say it was a fair trial, Trump erred but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise to the level to warrant removal from office. \n\nBy denying documents and witnesses, Trump appears frightened of testimony, apparently none of which is exculpatory.  Republicans now appear complicit in a cover up.  Democrats made a good faith attempt at the truth but were stymied by Republican efforts to save their president. Democrats held the high ground, while Republicans continued to defy facts, to defy common sense and to defy the appearance of fairness and fulfilling their Constitutional obligations.",

Right now, the dense Trump vibration seems ascendant. The tempers of Democrats are beginning to fray under the stress.\n\nSome Congressional Republicans are merely soulless career political hacks. Others have some decent instincts but are terrified to express them. Four Republican senators will need to find the courage to make fair-minded procedural decisions in order for the impeachment process to rise above the level of empty farce. It might happen. We will obediently watch the charade with desultory curiosity to find out. Is there any limit to our willingness to endure manipulation?\n\nIf Moscow Mitch succeeds in imposing his cynical will on the proceedings, will the public attach consequences to this behavior? One wants to believe that there could be punishment for brutally shattering the final illusions of democracy. \n\nA danger for Mitch is that securing a too easy and complete victory could prove to be a long-term mistake. Absolute authority is risky when it becomes obvious. Mitch is likely mindful of the value of enduring a few meaningless symbolic procedural defeats in the early stages of the show. It provides an appearance of give and take. His senators may be quite willing to function as puppets but they don't want the strings to be visible.",

GOP enablers expects their candidates for president and re-election to lie , commit treason and violate the law.\n\n It has been going on since Nixon interfered in Vietnam peace talks in 1968; lied about the progress of that war and covered up Watergate improprieties to win in 1972. Reagan did the same  secretly negotiating with Iran to hold our hostages until he was in office. Bush Jr, lied about success of Iraq invasion in 2004, and covered up improprieties in using torture . So if Trump used foreign aide to get reelected even if violating the law, the GOP enablers could care less. If the impeachment generates buckets of money for the GOP before the trial, even more will flow to GOP coffers after they acquit.\n\nI repeat dozens of prior posts here, if the charge was treason and conspiring with enemies of the US, this trial would  put all GOP Senators in a different position when viewed by the public. Trump has been conspiring to enable Russia since August 2016. The most important fact not mentioned  in the Ukraine scandal is pressuring Ukraine to find the DNC server as an excuse to withholding military aid. That disinformation came straight from Russia. Trump entered a quid pro quo in 2017 with former Ukraine leaders to exchange military aid for dropping assistance to Mueller. \n\nThese facts substantiate much  more than just  abuse of power . \nBut GOP expects its presidential contenders to abuse their power to get reelected.",

Pretty much none of it was deserved (see: fraud).\n\nWe'll never know if any other Republican president at this particular historical moment had made such a big mess if they would have received the stunning amount of undeserved support & protection Trump gets from McConnell and Co.   This might just be inevitable destiny for the G.O.P.  But it might be because Trump intrigued & turned out a base who'd never been such a big force in electoral politics before.  The aggrieved Trump base appeared as if out of thin air.\n\nThen there's Putin.  Would Putin have been as enthusiastic about roping in any other U.S. politician or did it have to be Trump who Putin knows is an insecure fanboy?  Trump once wondered before a 2012 visit to Moscow \"Will Putin become my new best friend?\"\n\nTrump has no clue how lucky he is.\n\nSad he's such a curse on democracy.",

Having managed to block all witnesses from testifying, failing to produce a single document, and hiring two lawyers to represent him in a Senate trial that only a dunce could have thought sounded competent, Donald will be astounded to discover that when all is said and done, while he might be acquitted by his Vichy GOP stooges, he will not be exonerated much less vindicated.  When he figures it out, the howls of rage and narcissistic injury will really be too much to bear.  Impeachment is forever.  He can cry me a river, but it won\u2019t change that.   \n\nThe truth will eventually emerge.  Donald isn\u2019t the only one on trial here.  Every senator who casts a vote to suppress or ignore the truth is guilty of a cover up and of willfully deceiving the American people by failing to faithfully uphold their oath to the constitution and as an impartial juror.  If we look at what happened to Nixon\u2019s staunchest defenders, it isn\u2019t a pretty prospect.  They were wiped out en masse in the next election, as they deserved to be.  Lindsey Graham really may have been prophetic when he said, \u201cIf we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed and we will deserve it.\u201d  I can only hope so, because boy, do they deserve it.",

The owner of the spa asked them, in a nice tone and very socially, where they were from. They answered they were visiting from Long Island, but I could tell they didn't like the question, no matter how socially he'd asked it, because the woman smiled a little pointedly and asked how come he didn't want to know where I was from, and he replied, \"look at what she's wearing, she's local.\"  At the time, I felt a little bad, like I'd disrespected the spa by going too casually.

If a realtor \"steers\" this couple away from certain properties, either because they are in upscale neighborhoods hoods or a neighborhood in a more economically depressed section of town, either scenario violates HUD rules and the FHA, and can result in censure and/or steep fine.\n\nYet, you fail to interview anyone from a real brokerage, or from HUD itself.

The fact that \u201cthey paid a price when they failed to perform these public identities,\u201d means that there is a trend of white people being quick to judge the actions of black people, to a point where they are not given equal opportunity. The fact that there are psychological effects, and that people of color need to put on a show to feel accepted and to be taken seriously by white people is devastating. Unfortunately, we live in a society centered around white people, and it is frustrating to see, but important to hear the perspectives of how deep this issue goes. I could almost argue that sometimes these microaggressions of racial profiling can be subconscious. This issue is so deeply rooted in our society that even a fleeting thought, these subconscious biases are socially ingrained and have negative consequences for innocent consumers.

This latter is ridiculous; the unspoken premise is that white people are afforded such deferential treatment.  They are not, and this is a regular flaw in black discourse on these topics;' black narrators imagine a world in which 'whiteness' is all-powerful and a white person can get away with murder and still be treated like royalty.\nPerhaps Mr. Trump experiences his life like that, but the rest of us certainly do not, and it is disagreeable and even racist to assume counterfactually that we do.

As we arrived at our destination, I asked if I could make a recommendation for him, and asked that he not take offense at it. Curious, he agreed, and listened. I said that he gave an excellent impression and could really go far. However, his use of the word \"aks\" for \"ask\" and other such words would inhibit his chances. Otherwise, he spoke perfectly. Others here have referred to \"Black English,\" and we could debate whether this is a dialect or whatever, and why it is spoken. There is proper English, and people who speak it, Black, White or Whatever, will get ahead sooner than those who do not. All Black newscasters speak proper English. Black fellow citizens can speak proper English if they wish, and that will help them advance. It is not discrimination, I believe, but simply a desire to have whatever company hires them be represented in a proper English format.

It is a sad statement that a black person, or really anyone, must so negatively strive to adapt to warring social ideals.\n\nIt seems to me, after all, that in an ideal society, two different \u201cworlds\u201d would be a puzzling anachronism. Were people treated evenly and fairly, the two cultures would be parts of one larger culture. All of the cultural influences blacks have contributed to American culture should be subjects of study by Academics, but otherwise unremarkable features of the larger culture. Irish immigrants, as an example, suffered significant bias against what were essentially religious and economic characteristics of their culture, yet those biases have been largely erased in practice and Irish origins are not seen as cultural deal breakers any longer, as the larger culture has incorporated the smaller into the American melting pot.\n\nCertainly skin color bias has made this difficult for blacks and others, but at some point shouldn\u2019t we resolve to get past that? That we haven\u2019t is, or ought to be, our national embarrassment. It isn\u2019t a perfect world, unquestionably, yet I do not yearn for a multicultural ideal. The influence of other cultures indeed makes us richer, but does so by adding. Separateness is a subtraction, and should not be our aim.",

Black people are discriminated against because of stereotypes, racism and the foundation this country is built upon. This is a fact. It is appalling that a black patron of a hotel would have to sign a \"no party\" agreement while other patrons are not subjected to this same treatment. It is also appalling that non-Black citizens still question the lived experiences of Black citizens or try to say \"we all experience the same things in different  ways.\"  \n\nFurthermore, while I understand that we may be judged (rightly or wrongly) based on our clothing, accessories and the like, it is foolish to think that the inner qualities of any person can be known based upon their exterior. For someone to think that a man in a Brioni suit is automatically \"better than\" a man in painter's overalls or a sweatsuit is foolish and a huge problem in our society. Read or watch \"American Psycho\" or learn about Ted Bundy and perhaps you will begin to understand where I am going with this line of thinking. We must get to know people before we discount them, and being dressed up in a shiny package does not automatically guarantee that they are a quality or even decent human being. One's skin color is in no way a designator of anything other than the amount of melanin in the skin. Period.",

It never ceases to bother me that people remain so petty, about appearances - whether the colour of a person's skin, or their attire. I agree that we should listen to anyone who has experienced racism, just as we should believe victims of sexual assault. We were not there to observe, so we need to accept those experiences as being real. As a white person myself I understand that many other white people simply do not want to accept that these thing still go on in the 21st century, because it destroys their (however naive) view of their 'just' world, and that, I think, is the reason for their reticence on the matter, not that they think it is acceptable behaviour. Until the Black Lives Matter movement I was unaware that so many people of colour were harassed by the police - How would you know without observing it firsthand? I think that we should all try to listen to each other more, and try to dispense with preconceptions (regardless of where they come from or who they are about) if we are to build a better, more just society.

Black people of this purportedly liberal bastion have been pushed to the outskirts, with little public transit, crummy housing and few jobs. Blacks seen around the city's so-called \"front yard\", Pioneer Square, are few, and mostly homeless. As a white person working in economic development I saw and heard  first-hand the second-class assumptions whites there make about people of color because they assumed I thought like they did. Segregation and exclusion is alive and well in Portland and throughout OR. Extremists including the KKK still have a visible presence. In 1844 the Oregon territory required any Blacks living there to leave. The OR constitution explicitly forbid black people to live there. The \"lash law\" said black people would be publicly whipped every 6 months, up to 39 lashes, until they left the state. In 1923 ORs Klan was the largest in the U.S. - amazing for a state with a low population. Pro-slavery statutes were not removed from the state constitution until 1926. Other racist language was not removed from the state constitution until 2002.  Because wealth, economics and politics in Portland and throughout OR are controlled by Whites, it's not likely to change soon, if at all. The Black population of Oregon is 1.91%; Whites are 84.42%.",

My dad spent an hour in the garage with him explaining how he couldn't wear that sweatsuit, because it would not reflect well upon him or our family, and would make him a possible target for police and other authorities. My father would not allow him to embody a stereotype.\n\nAnother incident: Our elementary school closed down and the building was purchased and became the local Jewish Community Center. We would stand in front of our former school and wait for our bus to the middle school. One night, someone threw rocks in the windows of the school. The janitor -- with no evidence, eye witness, nothing -- accused my brothers (the most harmless chaps you could possibly  imagine) of this vandalism. My parents immediately met with the authorities of the JCC. They advised them of our family's longstanding presence in the community and at that very school, and questioned the singling out of my two brothers over all others.

So if you show up wearing rags or driving a broken down car, I will wonder if you have the financial means to buy this house, and it won't have anything to do with your skin color.

I don\u2019t wear my grubbies out of the house because I don\u2019t like the treatment they encourage.\n\nIt is the degree of difference between poor treatment due to race and class that is important, at least if you want to fix the problem.

She'd had the termites dealt with but wasn't going to accept an offer from \"those people\" again because she didn't want her neighbors to have black neighbors.  I was appalled, and called the other agent and warned her not to get trapped in this illegal behavior.\n\nA year or so later I was bringing my buyers, a dark-skinned couple from Mexico, to a 2nd showing when the seller (who had been watching from across the street) came in and kicked us out, saying she had a bad back and couldn't have anyone in her house.  The way she was running said her back wasn't the problem.  The listing agent never called me back.  The buyers got a better deal on a house nearby.\n\nThe sellers were the problems in these 2 cases, but now I'm wondering if my telling a black couple that we had just received an offer on a house where I was doing an OH last spring was misconstrued.  But we HAD just received an offer while the OH was in progress, and while it hadn't yet been accepted, I felt obliged to be honest with everyone that came in afterwards, not just the black couple.\n\nI don't know what I could/should have done differently in these cases, but I'll be more aware in the future.

When I visit the place I grew up, I am forced to occupy the shell of the person I once was. It's a disarming takeover, not to mention disheartening. It's discouraging to come to the understanding that people can't simply be the people they are. Societal expectations are to be expected; but to what extent do we allow the systemic erasure of culture and vibrancy? The overexertion of forced practices being taken on by black people at the fault of white people is an undeniable wrongdoing. It is pertinent that white people hold accountability as a race, instead of individuals going to great lengths to deny such.",

There was a building across the street for sale, and we saw a black man waiting to see the place. My mom was always interested in real estate, and we asked him if he knew how much the place was listed for. I will never forget the angry look on his face.

            "comment_body": "Many years ago, a wealthy acquaintance of mine went to the then Texas Commerce Bank in downtown Houston and asked to talk with an executive.  The receptionist had no idea my acquaintance was the beneficiary of a very large trust at the bank, the one that is handled by \u201cprivate bankers,\u201d but based on the way my acquaintance dressed decided then and there that she probably had no business talking with said bank executive.   The receptionist went through the motions but apparently never called the executive to let him know of my acquaintance\u2019s request to talk with him.  My acquaintance knew what was going on and simply sat in the waiting area.  A while later, the executive happened to come out of his office and upon seeing her asked why she had not asked for him.  My acquaintance pointed to the receptionist and said she had.  The receptionist was embarrassed.  You see, my acquaintance never dressed the part of a successful person and generally experienced the treatment she received that day at the bank.  So while I do not dispute the fact people of color experience what you describe, after all I\u2019m a person of color myself and have had those experiences, many times the treatment is prompted by the way people dresses and acts, regardless of race.  It is regrettable this happens but it does.",

Suddenly I was accosted by a security guard who accused me of stealing the coat from their designer room. I removed the coat and showed him the label from a private store with my monogrammed initials. That gave me an idea of what people of color must go through on a regular basis. That decade I was also in Tiffany's in NYC and was trailed so closely by the security guard that I gave up and left. In the 1990's when I worked for myself in a male dominated industry, I was at a supply house where customers paid by check. I was told even though they could verify my check, they wanted cash. To add insult to injury, the manager informed me that I reminded him of the type of person who would \"go up in a bell tower and start shooting.\" I replied that if that feeling ever overcame me, I would make sure to start with him. Some people are just hateful and looking for an opportunity to lay their rage off on another. When it is racial, ethnic, sexist, or ageist, it is systematic. My mantra today is \"shop online.\"",

Yet many of them tend to self-segregate, living in predominately black residential areas. I also notice that other ethnicities Hispanics, Asians, etc. do the same thing. If you look closely you will find self-segregation by religion too. One of my friends is an Orthodox Jew. He lives in a small self-contained Orthodox community. Anyone could live & be welcome where he resides but none choose to. Which is the crux of the problem, if there is indeed a serious problem. Left to our own devices we as Americans tend to self segregate by race, religion, gender, class, sexual orientation,& a host of other things. The real estate industry is simply reflecting that. The work on commission. The faster they can sell a house, the more money they can make. They are incentivized to steer clients to areas that past experience tells them they will be more likely to purchase a home. Not everyone wants to live in a diverse community. Nothing wrong with that. And here's the dirty little secret that no one wants to talk about. The Fair Housing Act can't force us to start integrating, especially if we freely choose not to. Clearly many of us have chosen to live where we feel comfortable. The only way to change this is \u201cmandated social engineering.\u201d But that isn't the answer it goes against our nature.

Geltzer worries that making the trade would reward Trump's mis/malfeasance(s) aimed at dirtying Biden's name...\" on the hallowed floor of the Senate. \u201cThe floor of the Senate, Prof Geltzer, is not sanctified any longer. PresidentTrump has demolished America's Democratic and Judicial ideals, not merely because of the Ukraine spectacle, but with hundreds if not thousands of equally humiliating actions that are unamerican but remain unpunished.  He has, by pretense, obscured this from his cheerleading base. The House\u2019s credibility too hangs by a tattered thread - as weak as the GOP\u2019s grip on the Senate. Yet, nevertheless, Geltzer misses, at least, part of his own viewpoint. Nothing we have seen from President Trump and his cronies along with Republicans in name only, now owned or fearful Trumpists, who are not only marionettes for the now celebrated Puppeteer of Immorality in all American History but will be boarding the skiff that eventually will cross the River Styx if such continues.",

But, still what President Trump has done is an impeachable offense even if it leads to a truth about a matter. The ends do not justify the means in this case, and it goes against our constitution to let a President abuse his power and get away with it. It is very hypocritical of the Republican Party to do such thing as they are always attacking the Democratic Party saying that they are going against our Founding Fathers\u2019 wishes and against our Constitution especially with the amendment to bear arms, yet when it benefits them, they do not see a problem in violating the constitution.",

If the developer presented the idea to risk-management attorneys he would be advised not to do it as risk of investigation and prosecution would be great. DOL and US attorneys have successfully prosecuted cases with similar facts and put people in prison. The fact that the investment turned out to be a good and legitimate investment would not be sufficient for exoneration in a bribery case.\n\nThere is enough credible evidence in the Biden case for probable cause and investigation. Many such investigations are politically motivated, but if the investigation can be justified with facts a purely political motive is difficult to prove.\n\nHere's the real problem. \u00a0Once you entertain the possibility of Hunter profiting off Joe in Burisma, it lends legitimacy to Trump asking Ukraine to find out why the prosecutor investigating Burisma and Hunter was fired.",

Before a player comes to bat now, everyone all coaches can immediately pull up this player's average on breaking balls against left-handed pitchers when there's one out in the 6th inning with men on base.  I'm sure it was not hard for the players to convince themselves that they weren't cheating, but using available technology to their advantage.  I have no grand solution about how to stuff the metrics genie back in the bottle -- then break the bottle -- but I, like Tim Kurkjian, would prefer to see the 'Boys of Summer,' not stew in the algorithms of summer.",

Back then, baseball was pretty much like a regular job, albeit with extra fanfare.\n\nHe was proud of his All-Star and World Series wins.  At the time he was said to have the best curve ball in the AL and was considered to be one of the leagues's great right handers. But who's heard of Monte Pearson today?\n\nHe wasn't a show boat, hated doing press interviews, avoided as much as possible any bit of self-promotion. His greatness was easily over-shadowed by teammates DiMaggio and Gehrig.\n\nOver the years, all his World Series rings were stolen, along with much of the remains of his baseball career. He ended his life in a 9-to-5 job, always hurting from those shoulder injuries but never resentful of his mundane status.  He spoke of his 10-year baseball career with joy. He loved the game, as most players do, then and now.\n\n But if Uncle Monte saw what was happening today I know he would shake his head and say \"That's not baseball. That's cheating.\" But, in this world, cheaters often get the mentions in history books while unassuming stars fade into oblivion.",

Baseball, for a reason I understand, has made such retaliation illegal, but I kind of wonder if they looked the other way with retaliation like this, if a lot of problems might disappear. Yes, I know the arguments, how with pitchers throwing at 100 mph it is too dangerous, it is barbaric, all the usual stuff, but Ryan threw at batters and he was throwing as hard or harder than anyone in the game today, and back in the 1950's and 1960's pitchers like Feller threw hard and no one was killed by a deliberate beaning (baseball actually made it worse with the 'warning both benches' nonsense, they allow a pitcher to hit a player and basically get away with it, not much of a deterrent there). \n\nIf baseball is really serious about this, though, then they have to put on their brass knuckles and deal with the MLB players union to have severe penalties for this cheating. The players involved, except Beltran (who is no longer a player), basically face no penalty for their action because MLB is afraid of the union, especially since a new CBA  negotiation is coming up.  If they want to clean up the game they need to make the penalties fit the crime.",

For example, instead of the finger signs a catcher gives, a catcher could have a small device built into his mitt that allowed him to transmit a number to the pitcher, which would display on his glove, if done right, couldn't be stolen. \n\nBaseball always has had kind of a 'whatever means necessary attitude' towards winning, players openly used things like amphetamines, pitchers would do things like gouge their wedding ring so they could scuff the ball (with Whitey Ford, late in his career, Elston Howard sharpened his shin guards), and of course stealing signs was an old tradition . Players used to slide into second base spikes high, and teams at times tried to develop distractions in their stadium to throw off opposing batters. \n\nI think baseball does face a problem, but it isn't just this cheating scandal, the real existential problem baseball faces is that in the guise of winning, they have made baseball nearly unwatchable.  With analytics driven baseball, now we have things like the shift, we have endless pitcher changes, and have turned baseball, rather than a kids game played by adults (ie fun), into a 'serious business' crunched by numbers that a corporate beancounter only could love. MLB has forgotten baseball  is a lot more than winning, it was in how you win (or lost), analytics has made it machine vs machine, not players vs players, and it bores people to tears.",

Who wants to take away wins from the lovable Gaylord Perry who threw spitters or Phil Niekro who took emery board to the mound.\n\nOne of the most important jobs of a baseball manager is to make sure that you zealously guard against cheating. Getting pitch signs from the dugout instead of the catcher--especially after your star pitchers get walloped over and over--would have been a good idea for the Yankees and the Dodgers when they played the Astros. \n\nIn the end, smarter ways of defending your team from cheating are the only viable solution to this problem. Vacating championships would only punish Houston and Boston fans who are blameless and would only further alienate fans of the game. Any effort to write down rules about cheating would invite ever more clever ways to skirt the rules. In light of the firing of Jeff Luhnow, A.J. Hinch, and Alex Cora, perhaps Dave Roberts and Aaron Boone should be fined $1 for being such easy marks. This would send a message to all managers in the league to do a review of their procedures. Minimally, Roberts and Boone should publically apologize to Clayton Kershaw and Aroldis Chapman and get them some therapy sessions.",

The sportswriter, Grantland Rice, early 20th Century, is famous for \"It does not matter if you win or lose but how you play the game.\" Clearly, this is not always or maybe not even usually, the case as many ball players have gambled, lied, cheated, taken drugs, connived in many ways to win, sometimes with the tacit approval or at least the non-interference of authority.   \n2. Last night, I watched a rebroadcast of Derek Jeter's last game  as a Yankee against Baltimore, who was going to the playoffs, in 2014. After the Yankee reliever blew the 3 run lead and with the score tied in the bottom of the 9th and a runner on second, Jeter won the game with an RBI single in his last at bat.\nI cannot recall Jeter being accused of anything unsportsmanlike, cheating, etc. \nWhy is there a Jeter like that and an Astros club that cheats so brazenly?",

And the first known attempt at electronic sign stealing dates back 120 years. As an aside, I find it ironic that what Altuve and maybe others used was akin to what Pearce Chiles and Morgan Murphy conjured up in 1900, the difference being that, for the Astros, the buzzer wasn't buried in the third base coach's box. And banging on a garbage pail elicits a sort of je ne sais quoi. It's 2019 and you're banging on a garbage pail to pass signs? Come on!\n\nThough sign stealing is legal, apparently doing it electronically is going over some line. Yet, when pitchers and catchers talk business on the mound, they talk into their gloves and have been doing so for years. Why is that? Could it be because someone is going to read their lips, likely with something other than just their eyes, like maybe with binoculars or off a TV monitor? In that instance, someone has developed, however primitive talking into one's glove is, a better encoding system. \n\nA question that hasn't been asked yet is, how much did the Astros make in additional revenue for two WS appearances and a win in the past three years? Likely, it was much more than the $5 million they were fined. In the world of 'money talks (and we all know the rest),' the $5 million fine was worth it. \n\nMaybe it's time for MLB teams to develop their version of the Navajo code.",

The penalties currently meted out don't begin to restore any credibility to the game.  A cheater is a cheater period. It's clear the Astros players were participants in this cheating scandal.  Anything gained from said cheating MUST be removed.  The Astros didn't win anything in 2017.  At a minimum the 2017 World Series needs to be left blank as a winner. Any gains (rings, added paychecks etc.) from that cheating must be confiscated, and the fans should have their money refunded.  The records should be blank for 2017 : no one WON the World Series, everyone lost as a result of cheating.\n  Fairness, and assurance no one would replicate any cheating scandal, would eject all players and participants in the sign stealing scandal from the 2017 Astros from any continuance of participation in major league baseball.  In addition, all players would have a asterisk next to their records explaining such.",

You can't have  it both ways.  You can claim everyone else is doing it, too, which includes the fellow teammates who share the championship.

I read about how outraged everybody was to learn that several White Sox players effectively \"threw\" the World Series to the Reds to get some extra money. \n\nAs I got older, though, I came to believe that the far bigger scandal about baseball in 1919 was that African-Americans (like Doug Glanville) were prohibited from playing. Shoeless Joe Jackson taking some money to underperform in the World Series came to look like a far smaller issue compared to Jackson's likely refusal (Jackson was a white man born in South Carolina in 1887) to ever play in a game against blacks. \n\nSo in 2020, I think baseball needs to address head-on some other issues that to me are more problematic to me than sign-stealing: Among other things, billionaire owners demanding taxpayers foot the bill for construction or renovation of stadiums, incredibly high prices for tickets and food/drink at the stadiums, and so forth.",

This is the essence of competition:\n\n\"It has to matter how you get there, how you respected the road that was paved before you arrived and how you lay down a foundation for a future game.\"\n\nAlmost a century ago Grantland Rice said it best:\n\n\"It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game\".\n\nAnd perhaps more relevant, a 2019 marked the 100 year anniversary of the Black Sox scandal where the Chicago White Sox threw the World Series after 8 players took pay offs from gamblers. So cheating has always been around.\n\nBut what's different today, in ALL sports, is the change in the fans acceptance of it - when THEIR team wins. Lombardiism has overtake Grantland's admonition: \"Winning isn't everything, it's the ONLY thing\". Patriot fans are defiant in defense of their team's persistent, proven cheating, and the more it goes on, the more teams are encouraged to do it \"because everyone does it\".\n\nWhat's needed is for baseball to take the lead as it did in 1919 and set the example for everyone to follow. The titles of the Astros, and the Red Sox need to be vacated. Also, MLB should also vacate any individual titles won due to steroid use. Drastic? Yes, but that's what is needed to send a clear message.",

This seemingly minor discretion results in greater forward momentum and increased pitch velocity, and has been one the major reasons we've seen record high strike outs and record low hits, as pitchers all over the league routinely violate Rule 6.02. All of this has changed the nature of the game for the worse in recent years, but it's a problem that can easily be monitored in real time using digital technology once MLB and the media finally decide to look into the problem.",

I'm afraid that when critics talk about \"the game\" they have come to refer solely to the game that is played at the major league level. At its worst, the sign stealing fiasco is a case of millionaires cheating other millionaires. Yet for over two decades MLB played \"see no evil\" with the widespread use of PED's and HGH, a scandal that seeped down to affect every level of the game. We'll never know how many amateur players were deprived of a chance at a seven-figure payday because, while they played the game clean, teammates and competitors had made a calculation that to get a shot in the professional ranks,  they needed to emulate what everyone with a pair of eyes knew that a host of MLB stars were doing. Yes, the Astros' scheme victimized their opponents not just in the World Series but throughout the seasons involved.  But I'd submit that the victims of the steroid scandal were injured much more significantly and, unlike the 'Stro's competitors, they will remain faceless and nameless forever. Here's a step MLB could take to redeem itself from that earlier and greater scandal - a plaque in the HOF celebrating all the players, at every level of the game, who played the game cleanly during the Steroids Era.

Bobby Thompson hit the shot heard round the world in 1951 with the assistance of sign stealing. But the sign-stealing committed by the Astros went way beyond the conventional forms of sign-stealing, elevating it to a level where it went from a runner standing near second base conveying a sign to a high-tech electronic system on a whole-team level. It's curious that baseball etiquette has always declared taboo for a batter to look back at the catcher to steal signs (fights have broken out between batter and catcher) but the Astros took that to an endemic level. Their 2017 World Series victory is now tainted and, if justice is to be done, should be declared void, and any of the perpetrators, including management and players, should be banned from the game permanently. That's the only message that will deter further cheating of this sort. If this is not done, fans will always be left wondering if the teams they root for or against are playing the game fairly.",

In WWII, some people in the French government chose to stop resisting the Nazis, but their actions made more people suffer from atrocities, especially the Jews in France. However, not all the French gave up their resistance, and general De Gaulle continued to fight in Africa. Furthermore, at that certain period, it may be impossible to find a neutral position. Holland was neutral in World War I, they tried to do the same thing in World War II, and they were finally invaded by Nazi. It is a little bit like \u201cprisoner's dilemma\u201d, If other people choose to resist and some people choose to escape, the loss of those who escape will be smaller, but if all people choose to escape, all people will bear greater loss. Therefore, it is necessary to teach people to stand out at the critical moment. Sometimes, escaping can reduce some of their own losses, but if all people choose to escape, all people will lose more.

The pre-war Jewish population of Germany was tiny - less than 1%. For the Hitlerites, anti-Semitism was an all-consuming passion. Most Germans didn't know any and just didn't care - the Nurnberg laws were the problem of a small group. The Nazis knew Kristallnacht didn't go over well with the \"Volk,\" but not enough to make a difference, and in any case, it was too late for the 'upstanding' to take any meaningful action. I think the point here is that we want to avoid ever being in the position of having to avoid collaboration with pogroms, mob violence or genocide. That starts with rejecting indifference to the suffering of even the 'least among us' - which itself stands, sometimes uncomfortably for its members, at the very heart of the Jewish and Christian faiths as it does for most of us.",

My family provides an example of why the author is right. Most of our dead could not have been saved. They were marched from their homes and murdered in mass shootings within hours of the SS arriving into their villages in Ukraine and Belarus. Many of their neighbors joined in the killing actions. Some survived the initial killing actions and hid but ultimately were betrayed by neighbors. Only one aunt survived because of heroism. First, my aunt's gentile best friend, a 16 year old girl, intercepted her and warned her to hide because the SS had entered the village and were marching the Jews to their death (she later helped her escape into the forest). Second, just after the killings, an elderly neighbor lied to the SS men searching for my aunt by saying she had seen her run into the forest. Importantly, this lie was only necessary because a different neighbor had informed the SS my aunt had escaped the killings and was hidden somewhere in the village. Had this woman not collaborated, the second woman's bravery and risk would have been unnecessary. The simple truth is there was little space for heroism in the midst of atrocity. Anyone who attempted to help Jews was shot dead on sight. However, it's indisputable that many would have survived if it weren't for the collaborators. How much better it would have been had they simply done nothing.",

Nurse: Oh, yeah. He's OK. Patient: Just OK?...) If society conveys to people that something less than moral courage is expected of them, then that's what most people will expect of themselves. Of course, none of us are always strong, brave, and compassionate. But that doesn't mean we should settle for less. Teachers, parents, coaches and drill sergeants hold their charges to high standards because those standards are aspirational; it's understood that people will not always rise to the occasion or live up to expectations, but it's also assumed, rightly, that they are much more likely to do so if the bar is set high to begin with. In any case, the writer's closing remarks ironically undermine his argument. Refusing to turn people in, not helping to organize oppression, and seeking to ameliorate it when it happens--these are not safe compromises with conscience. Authoritarian and/or totalitarian governments take note of such things, which are de facto  forms of standing up to oppression, and do not allow them to go unpunished, as the suffering visited upon the victims of autocrats from Hitler to Lenin to Kim Jung Un attests. When the most modest act of nonconformity can result in a person being blacklisted or shipped off to the Gulag, moral heroism may be less a choice than a matter of necessity.",

I have chosen to intervene in similar circumstances in the past, but having seen the beginning of the fight, I thought both guys were idiots and not worth bothering with. As I continued reading my book, I heard a new voice in the noise. A guy far smaller than the guys fighting had jumped in between the 2 gladiators and was trying to break up the fight. I could also see the other passengers becoming more alarmed, so I put down my book and jumped in between the fighters. Between the little guy and myself we managed to stop the fight. The two wannabe gladiators got off at the next stop. A woman came up to me as the train moved on and thanked me. I wasn't sure what to say in response. I don't think I would have jumped in if the little guy wasn't already in the middle of the fight. I think my motivation for acting was fear that someone on the train would pull out a gun and embarrassment that the little guy was risking his neck while I was reading a book. We need upstanders because their actions can sometimes embarrass a bystander to join them.",

Using his moral authority as archbishop of Athens, Damaskinos also had 19 distinguished Greeks from the arts, the law, academia and business worlds co-signed his letter......according to the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation, the appeal of Damaskinos and his fellow Greeks is unique as no document similar to the protest against the Nazis during World War II has come to light in any other European country. \nDamaskinos went on to publish the letter, even though the local Schutzstaffel (SS) commander, J\u00fcrgen Stroop, threatened to execute him by firing squad.

The fact is that anyone whose hand wasn't raised in a Nazi salute at a parade or who didn't display a swastika in Hitler's Germany was suspect. Once people take little steps to go along with a majority or even a sizeable minority who are advocating hateful policies, it is easy to continue down that slippery slope. Why do you suppose so many Germans after WWII denied any knowledge of concentration camps and the Final Solution for Jews? They had convinced themselves that their Jewish neighbours had been rounded up for \"relocation\" in the East. Even if they didn't loot the Jews' homes or businesses, they were aware that looting took place and did nothing. How much easier was it to tell themselves that the Jews must have done something to deserve being arrested? Ultimately, we all have to confront a terrible decision to do what is right or to look the other way and allow wrong to be done. We can't avoid our complicity in a crime that we know is taking place because to act is dangerous. We are still complicit.",

Anti-semitism was officially part of the 'educational core' taught at American war colleges, and permeated the officer corps well into the 1970s. Jewish survivors of the death camps were cursorily designated DPs (displaced persons) by the US military, which treated them with extreme contempt and suspicion, herding to camps, denying them rations. The US and European governments were happy to deport the survivors to Israel, fulfilling in their own way the Final Solution of 'ridding Europe' of the Jewish Problem.\n\nRead \"The Jewish Threat\" by Joseph W.

Add the hate-filled propaganda; the unchecked criminality of Hitler in the earlier decade; the fear of socialism that led industrialists to finance him.

The rule of Hitler began with the demolition of a democratic government, then immediate internment, torture, and murder of political opponents and intellectuals/critics.

No one even knew his name or how to find him after the war, including me, even though I was living in The Netherlands, an hour away from him. Fortunately, this spring, a book about the life of Zwartendijk, written by Dutch author Jan Brokken, will be published in English.",

She wanted me to know very specifically how awful the American and British bombing was during the war---a fact, however little press it tends to get anymore---and that, to paraphrase her, that \"Jews were much better treated in Germany before the war than people thought.\" While I was aghast at that suggestion, I saw no point in arguing with a woman almost 90 years old.\nHow many people do we simply overlook in our every day lives? How often do we degrade the humanity of other people? When we judge others as good and bad, how easy it is to stigmatize the supposed bad.",

In the Netherlands, where the local population was probably the least anti-Semitic in Europe, over 75% of the Jews were murdered. However, in Bulgaria, where the local population was as anti-semitic as any Eastern European country, and the Bulgarian government was pro-Nazi, almost all the Jews were saved. Also, in Hungary, up until the Spring of 1944, almost all Jews were saved, even though the government of Hungary was virulently anti-semitic and passed Nazi-like anti-jewish legislation. It was only until the Germans occupied Hungary that deportations took place. \n\nThe reason why Jews survived or were murdered is related to the capabilities of the Nazi occupiers, and whether or not they had the mechanisms to carry out Hitler's extermination policies, not whether local occupied populations were anti-semitic.",

As for German civilians,  I have known many who claimed not to know.  Skepticism is common, but it is based less on evidence than the claim that \"they had to know\".  \n\nLittle told are the stories of German civilian life during the war.  Civilian deaths numbered in the millions, including 500,000 targeted by Allied bombers to break the will of the people.  And German civilians lived among as many as 15 million foreigners doing forced labor.   As for their living conditions. these deteriorated as the war progressed, and were horrific by 1945..  \n\nThe attention of German civilians was constantly distracted from the fate of Jews by the horrors of war.  Add to this the fact that millions of war deaths of family members were a constant.  All of this must be factored in when claiming that \"they had to know.\"  \n\nToday, our carbon footprints are unsustainable and our descendants may well view all of us as complicit in future deaths.

This example of the Holocaust is likely the most extreme example of hate that has ever been recorded in history and presents the most difficult case of where being a upstander, or even a bystander, would have been the most dangerous. \n\nFor many people in their normal lives, the consequences of failure when being an upstander or bystander is significantly less than that would have been the case in the Holocaust. As well in modern cases, stopping an action of hate is less difficult than it would have been in the case of the Holocaust. Today, not being a upstander when an action of hate has been committed would be less understandable than during the Holocaust, where being an upstander would inflict the whole wrath of the Nazi Gestapo or Nazi SS.\n\nWhile some forgiveness or understanding can be made for the millions of bystanders and collaboratorators during the Holocaust, those people also grew up in a different, difficult, and more racist time than today. Such ignorance of hate occuring today would be most definately more problematic today, with the improvements that we have made in terms of racism and all.",

Identify the Jews, refuse commerce with  the attacked minority, co-operate with the authorities or you will suffer consequences, perhaps just a fine, or maybe your job, or your freedom or even life. Especially in the electronic linked world where privacy is so compromised, the term bystander has less and less meaning.  So all of us are faced with the issue of co-operation and compromise and the question isn't just actively seeking out and collaborating with an unjust or evil government.  The code of universal human decency requires that we all need to take a stand against monstrous injustice. This is true even if we are very frightened.  Courage is defined as the ability to help those in need despite our fear. Perhaps that means sharing food or money with destitute immigrants , perhaps it means much more.  Monstrous injustice also practically requires resistance to stop it.  French and Czech partisans sabotaging Nazi rail lines materially helped defeat the Axis.  I'm afraid there's no getting off the hook of moral responsibility in the face of extreme injustice.  It's a matter of what each of us is capable of doing.",

So I agree with the author to some extent, but in the extreme case even the author's prescription is not enough.\n\nBefore viewing this museum, I had felt that there are parallels with the current administration of the US: inflammatory rhetoric branding outsiders as evil, nativism, propaganda undermining the rule of law and offering a bizarrely upside down view of reality. After the museum, I realized the importance of physical violence in undercutting democratic institutions.  And the utter extremism of the \"master race\" philosophy. It reminded me that parallels to Nazi Germany should be made very carefully; evil continues, but the evil of Nazism was exceptional.",

The framework for deciding on a bystander strategy is first to consider personal safety, and secondly to determine whether you have influence (capacity) to make a difference.  Diving on to a loaded gun or publicly confronting a CEO is foolhardy, likely ineffective, and no doubt will exacerbate the situation.  Conversely, doing nothing (even just refraining from complicity) is not enough.  Disruption, support of targets, recruiting those with enough influence to act, distracting, making the positive aspects of the target visible and obvious, sharing information widely and standing with targets are among the many options one can consider that, depending on one's status, power, and authority, may be effective.  I share a heritage with Dr. Weinberg, and agree with her Mom.  We have a moral duty to make an effort.  To help, with the only limitation being that we must stay safe while doing so.",

When you are in a position to do more than sit on the sidelines, you should seize the opportunity to do so.  As you yourself point out, many who act do not see themselves as heroes -- they see their actions as ordinary, not extraordinary.  \nYou denigrate the Jewish commandment:'Do not stand idly by..'.   Do you really consider this value to be relatively insignificant in the Jewish tradition?  You also appear to dismiss the importance of the transmission of such values from generation to generation.  How else will core principles of Judaism survive?  \n Bottom line:  I refuse to sit on the sidelines.  I also want others to be 'upstanding'.  Your providing a justification to do nothing in the face of evil and injustice does a great disservice to society.",

I can remember asking my father, \"Dad, why would anyone agree to do those things?\" His response was never definitive and seemed to share in my bewilderment. The shared-assumption was that somehow, those people were \"evil.\"\n\nNow as I look around at relatives, friends, and neighbors who celebrate a clear fascist movement in Trump, I find myself battling with anger, disgust, and disappointment. Many of those who are following the anti-hero are the people were the first to denounce such evil, to raise flags to honor the fallen, and to cheer as modern folk-hero's as they fought off the Nazi-regalia wearing bad guys in movies.\n\nWhile it's easy to think of them as \"stupid\" or \"evil,\" I know they're not (most of them). They're afraid. \n\nIn the late 60's, Ernest Becker proposed that as humans want to be \"a person of value in a world of meaning.\" Culture is what provides us with the map. When that map fails when compared to the map of another group, existential terror grips us. In response to this terror, humans become more polarized in their views and attempt to convert or annihilate those who's world view is different from our own. We need to find a way to make our fellow citizens feel heard. There IS space in America for differing worldviews, it's part of the dream that spawned our nation.",

About forty percent of high-ranking NKVD officers had Jewish nationality recorded in their identity documents, as did more than half of the NKVD generals.\"\n\npg 108 - \"When the mass killing of the Great Terror began, about a third of the high-ranking NKVD officers were Jewish by nationality.\"\n\nOne could also read about Lazar Kaganovich or that Molotov (of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) had a Jewish wife.\n\nAt some point, for me the moral question switched from A-'Look what someone else did' to B-'What would I do?

(Eventually he would also be in numerous concentration camps as well.) He became sick. Ordinarily when children became ill and couldn't work they would be murdered immediately. But the owner of the factory put young Michael on a cot outside his office, nursed him to health and let no one hurt him or take him away.  A saint? Hardly. My uncle, although Jewish, had blond hair and blue eyes. In fact Uncle Mike looked like the factory owner's brother. This man sometimes would drop Jews into vats of acid. Yet he saved my uncle's life. Beyond the random nature of the universe we also need people who heroically step up. It is true, I suspect, that on Wednesday I might see a horror take place and freeze. Or even run. Yet the following Thursday I might see the same situation and run to help despite the risk. On different days different people can respond in different ways. Most of us will not always be heroes. But there are moments when we feel more alive than others, when we are in touch with some special part of ourselves. And then we do leap into the fray thoughtless of the consequences. Some day I might have to shave and look into the mirror. But Rivka Weinberg has a point. As the doctors murmur, \"First do no harm.\" Alas Josef Mengele never learned that lesson. He was called the Angel Of Death.  We are all saviors if we want to be. And I'm not speaking mystically.",

The two dictators had agreed on an amicable division of Eastern Europe, and no one thought that Hitler would be crazy enough to invade the Soviet Union. As subsequent interviews testified, many if not most Sugihara survivors were not fleeing a then-unimaginable Nazi takeover of Lithuania but escaping becoming citizens of the Stalinist state.",

And certainly the author did not stint in her praise of those who DO find the courage to speak out or act against catastrophic injustice.\n\nUnfortunately, the essay focuses on examples that are tone deaf to today\u2019s circumstances.  Yes, in certain societies like Italy there was very little cooperation with NAZI genocidal measures against Jews. But the Italians didn\u2019t elect Hitler (even if they did elect Mussolini). It was circumstances in Germany (where Hitler\u2019s party never won more than 40% of a fair election).\n\nTHAT is why we MUST fear indifference and the kin circumstances of ignorance and despair in the US today where \u201cOUR\u201d president* is actively whipping up fears and hatreds against vulnerable populations and immigrants.  THAT is why we MUST fear apathy, ignorance, and numb fatalism while our Senate collaborates with a power abusing president even to the extent of saying that \u201cabuse of power is NOT an impeachable offense.\u201d",

Also, he protects the civil rights of the people of this country by not allowing just anyone to ignore our immigration laws and fraudulently misuse our asylum laws.  And he doesn't just give foreign governments funds without asking for something in return.  Ironically it is he that is least fascist.  Ironic because he's being accused of fascism on the basis that he has character.

He helped survivors live these camps until new homes could be found. I learned about this from my mother.\n\nWhen he came back to America in 1946, he married, went to college on the GI bill, started a family, and live the American dream. He grew a thriving office furniture business in NJ. He died when I was 15 of a bad heart.\n\nThe lesson he passed unto me from his WWII experience of  protecting & caring for his fellow soldiers who came from all walks of life in America, was that he wanted his children to live in a mixed community. This would be the only way we to prevent a Holocaust in America. Soon, other immediate family members moved out their \"Jewish only communities\". \n\nAs horrible as WWII and the Holocaust was, we need to be diligent in protecting our democracy and get active to prevent the dark side of human nature of living in fear, hatred, and divisiveness.\n\nThanks to all the Dads who sacrificed their lives and time to prevent this from happening.",

As I am writing a book on \"The Underground Practices that Has Normalized Child Abuse,\" this article is so timely and appropriate for our political landscape.  \n\nI agree there is some confusion and fallacy of \"be an upstander and not a bystander.\" It is not clear how it manifests itself in real life. It also infuses a false sense of security.  \nWhen the victims of Larry Nassar spoke out as early as 1999, everyone around them covered up. It took 20 years to stop Larry Nassar.  \n\n The collaborator are just as guilty as the perpetrators and therefore, they should be held accountable with severe  personal consequences for their crimes. \n\nThe perpetrators are the \"malicious virus.\" But those who cover up are the injector of the \"malicious virus.\"  \n\nWhich is worse? \n\nThe reason we have 'cancers' induced in our society; it is because the \"collaborators\" are the enablers. The cover ups range from financial corruptions to disregard to human life.\n\nCompanies should not be liable legally to protect the \u201cperpetrator or their \"collaborators\".  These co-conspirators  should be personally responsible for spreading the cancer.\n\nThere should be not only moral obligation but legal obligation. We must enforce laws and policies with severe consequences for the cancer to subside.",

Here is a short history of some of these issues. When post Kant, we dropped the correspondence theory of truth, and did not fully embrace the pragmatic approach (William James helped birth this approach), then things like ethics and speaking of values, was kicked to the curb like a unwanted bit of trash. So truth became what I said it was, based on what I desire to be the case. And so here we are, a collection of Americans, each retreated into the private world of their technology, with no new information getting in. And it is this, that tragically just is the situation we find ourselves in. But the truth is, not all values or ethics is relative or situational; we simply could not function if we did not share some sense of values and of what is the right thing to do. Now, Trump, Trump's base, and progressives, are all practicing identity politics; meaning, the point of community is to allow me to self-actualize my individual self. Yes, but why you alone? Do you not know you can not find your self, alone in this way, without  understanding we are part of a greater whole. The academic left has held that these ideas of sharing  are part of the oppression of the dominate culture, the powers that be. They have screamed this long enough that Trump's base is now thinking like them. We must learn to work together, now.",

Truly, 2+4=4.  Moreover, making the threat to withhold military aid to the Ukraine for this purpose arguably damaged US security (if one accepts the overwhelming of American diplomats and military professionals).  That the aid was released doesn't wash away that Trump's actions were almost certainly in the interests of his own interests.\nSenate Republicans know this, and know that this act is certainly in any meaningful interpretation of the Framer's intent, an act that violates the President's Constitutional duties, and just one example among many.  \nAnd yet they don't act.\nSo what is this column saying?  That Romney, Sasse, Collins get a moral pass acting as bystanders?\nThe truly sad part of this is that they would risk so little by acting. Most are wealthy, and practically speaking, risk little.",

Ms. Weinberg offered no such analysis of Nazi Germany thus what form of action needed to have been taken.  To suggest that it was a gratuitous flare up of European hostility to Jews begs the question.\n\nA feature of Nazism is the subsumption of civil society under the state and the exercise of violence against any who don't\nsubmit (euthanasia of the handicapped, communists and unions, non-Christians, etc.). That, more than culture, is the context of the genocide.\n\nThe historical  situation in which Nazism arose cannot be ignored: the socio-economic misery resulting in part  from the Treaty of Versailles and in part from the capitalist depression.  This suggests the conditions for Nazi genocide were nationalism and capitalism. \n\nAppropriate action was defined well before the onset of the mass murder of Jews.

She also ignores that the Nazis and the Soviets had been working hard to decapitate Poland before the Holocaust began. Those Poles most likely to be able to help were in Auschwitz, Dachau, or mass graves.

When I see Donald Trump performing at any of his rallies it sends chills down my spine. It is so reminiscent of the Hitler rallies of the 1930s, but on a smaller scale. The tone and the cult engagement are the same. Many of the actions this Administration has been undertaking are for the most part sub-human, such that in our contemporary context it will not be enough for people to stand-by and simply not-participate. That helps but it is insufficient. Active counter-action is essential to keep peoples' minds focused on real societal values and priorities, and to obstruct the worst abuses of this regime, bent on destroying the very institutions, regulatory framework and the culture of rule of law that made the country great, being done to advance an authoritarian vision of Executive power that is very dangerous to the survival of democracy.",

Whole families were executed, yet Poland has most people recognized by Yad Yashem. Those people were even more heroic then the Japanese consul in Vilnius. The majority of Jews in Poland and Lithuania (Vilnius was Polish before WWII) lived in their own communities and constituted the largest percentage of any country population in Europe. It was the result of the tolerant attitude of Polish kings and nobles. Therefore, it was easy for Germans to round up Jews during WWII, to close them in gettos and to transport them to concentration camps that were also built there by Nazi for convenience.",

When these institutions decline, so does behavior that tolerates hate, especially organized and hierarchically institutionalized hate.  There is always a deep fear of harm to oneself or one's family when a fascist government permeates all of society, whether that government is called communist or national socialist or absolute monarchy (tsarism).  Failure to collaborate, to affirm loyalty becomes itself a crime.\n\nCollective resolve to actively resist is the only effective deterrent to coercive pressure.  Examples include the Danish\nexport of Jews to Sweden, Norwegian resistance to a Quisling regime, and Le Chambon, the Protestant village that sheltered Jewish children in the heartland of France.\n\nIn the US, communities and activists in Idaho, Montana, and Washington state reclaimed their towns from antisemitic, racist militias.  We now need to actively resist using collective organization and ethical norms.  Or else the Tea Party movement that joined with white supremacists and radical evangelicals will transform our country into a retrograde semi-fascist state that targets the vulnerable.",

My mother and her parents survived the Holocaust in Vilna Poland (Vilnius Lithuania today), a place where the Nazis and their Lithuanian collaborators murdered 98% of the 100,000 Jewish civilians who liven in a city known as \"The Jerusalem of Lithuania\". My mother survived due to the covert, obstructionist efforts of the commander of her slave labor camp, a man named Major Karl Plagge. Plagge mostly played within the rules, giving work permits, arguing with the SS over the lives of the women and children in the camp saying that to \"relocate them\" would hurt unit moral and efficiency. However, he did not directly confront the perpetrators of genocide and tried to avoid actions that could get him arrested for treason. Ultimately his efforts saved the lives of 250 Jews. After the war, after remaining silent for over a decade about what he had seen in Vilna, he wrote a serious of letters to a Jewish attorney he met while testifying at a war crimes trial, saying \"Perhaps in other places only a small amount of determination was lacking in order to prevent or decrease the atrocities. I never felt this needed special courage. It required only the conviction and strength that anyone can draw from the depth of moral feelings that exists in all humans\".",

There were sympathetic people, but what can an individual do to stop the 'system'?  Nothing.  There were at least two major enablers in Germany to the perfect storm.  A large population of frustrated WW1 veterans who had crossed the threshold of murder and violence in war, and  had a political ax to grind.  An explosive political environment of polar extremes, and municipal residence registries, and fine record keeping in Germany for centuries, where magistrates can find anyone, and their background.  Without any of these enablers, the holocaust could not have happened in Germany at least.  In occupied territories other factors was a major contributing factor.  Plus the nature of Europeans, including Germans, living in a corset of mass rule.",

Not every Dutch person had the moral strength to hide Jews in their home.\n\nBut that does not mean all the others merely watched, aware of the evil, and did nothing.  On one occasion, when one of the Jews took sick, they had to call a doctor for help.  The doctor came, treated the sick person, and on leaving said to Anneke's mother, \"When I cross this threshold I will remember nothing of what I have seen.\"  He, too, could have done \"otherwise,\" but chose not to do so.\n\nI have heard Anneke tell the story of her parents' courage and compassion many times.

Those who are already anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay, etc.  are not going to lessen their support for a powerful figure who validates their own prejudices because some \"bleeding heart liberal\" asks them to play nicely.  Those who are not anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay, etc.  would be disinclined to collaborate, but might normally be inclined to \"stand up\" against such behavior.

That trade has now enriched China so it can afford its high tech 1984 social control infrastructure. \n\nSo now with little personal risk, we as a nation are indifferent to the authoritarian infrastructure being built as long as semi-slave labor are coerced into building us I-phones.

That is the situation the professor is addressing.\n\nWhen my son J. was 5 years old, an older kid in his afterschool program repeatedly threatened to kill him. It was an empty threat I'm sure, but very scary. Some of the other kids - bystanders - organized the \"J. Protection Club.\" The bully felt left out and asked to join. The kids solved the problem.

There are, of course, consequences socially, sometimes personally costly, but usually not life-threatening.   Lately, this has been changing, a disturbing phenomenon.\n\nWe know it is wrong for innocent people to die because of race, religion, political party, economic injustice...We know that those who incite or condone violence or repression,  no matter their status, are immoral.

Both Italy and Bulgaria were allied with Nazi Germany during WW II and thus had more leverage in protecting their Jewish citizens.  Occupied Holland experienced a 75% murder rate of its Jewish population, while in France, which collaborated (and where much of the country was unoccupied), the murder rate was only approximately one third as high.   I don't think it's reasonable to believe that the Dutch were so much more anti-semitic than the French (nor than the Danes who were able to rescue most Jews), and, in fact, it was the Dutch, not the French, who staged protests against the initial anti-semitic laws imposed by the Nazis. Wasn't the collaborationist Vichy government (which, one could say, \"welcome[d] the murderers\") more able to protect French Jews? In occupied Europe it would, in fact, have taken moral courage to avoid participating in evil. In addition to organized resistance and religious leadership, political factors made a substantial difference (such as American pressure on Vichy France).  It's not \"effective and easy enough\" to stop atrocities, particularly under a military dictatorship.  We here in a safe democracy can't--or won't--stop the death and destruction carried out in our name.  These three prescriptions are not \"enough.\" Much more is required.",

First of all, their main use is to point out to people today that each of us have choices of how we act in the face of evil and wrongdoing. Consciously rejecting collaboration is, in fact, one way to resist and be an upstander, and might even be a \"heroic\" act at some time.  \"Martyrdom\" is not a category that is suggested or mandated by teaching about the choice between being a a \"bystander\" or \"upstander,\"  as Weinberg implies.  There is one other (sub-)category that I would bring to Prof. Weinberg's attention that I add to the others when I use them in my teaching: \"Organizer.\"  Individual acts of \"upstanding\" may be necessary at times, but group acts are generally more effective and often safer.  An \"organizer\" invites others first to see that something is wrong, suggests that resistance or change is possible, discusses a range of strategies and identifies options for action, involves the group in making a plan, then taking collective action, and afterwords  re-group to plan further actions. Let's really be clear, Prof. Weinberg's looking back is not really helpful for those of us trying to look forward and needing how to deal with the evil we see growing all around us today.",

While Professor Weinberg's point that \"upstanding\" education is a shallow and technocratic response to the problem, I don't think that the solution is studied indifference. Years ago, the government recommended three 20-minute sessions of vigorous exercise (heart rate at the 80% range) a week. Recently, it lowered its recommendation to five sessions of moderate exercise (such as walking for 30 minutes) a week, largely because people considered the original plan beyond their reach. Professor Weinberg has similarly lowered the moral bar. In this age of relentless self-interest and self-promotion, our moral leaders cannot even imagine asking people to be self-sacrificing or to resist evil. Instead, they can only suggest: \"make sure not to help\".",

NYC might be a good example because it's full of different sorts of people and yet for the most part small acts of heroism happen daily. But let's look at a big act.\n\nThe author defined heroism as \"upstanding\" to help a stranger and risking your life. One example that comes to mind is the not-all-that-rare occasion when someone ends up on the subway tracks. Unless you are not injured by the fall, and not panicked, and know ahead of time to go to the end of the platform where there's a ladder, it's nearly impossible to get out of the tracks. This is because the platform overhangs the tracks. There's a lip. Without upper-body strength, and are tall, you can't pull yourself up. If you're injured, your situation is worse.\n\nTime and again (if you read the tabloids) you read stories of total strangers jumping into the tracks area to help others. The lesson here is that NYers share a sense of belonging to that person. I'm not sure if it's a sense of common culture or identifying with that person's plight in the moment, but it exists. And so perhaps the larger prescriptive lesson the author could include would be to teach how much we are all alike and that we share culture. You are me and I am you.

What can one citizen do against the knowledge that in the eastern European countries, the movement toward racist dictatorship and racism was often slow, chipping away at basic human rights of particular groups, first marking them and then isolating them?  Why is there no tangible recognition of the growing threat here, where hate crimes have risen significantly in the last year?  Why should there even be a question about the re-election of the politicians who have accepted and thus perpetrated this?  Why do we not learn the lessons of Nazi Germany and how Hitler was handed power, partly through massive rallies of blissful citizens chanting hate messages but also through democratic election?

The right to mount a vigorous defense is a human right, to protect the innocent. The facts of this case as I know them certainly don't suggest innocence to me, but \"prove you're innocent, waive your rights to a defense\" is a police and prosecutorial tactic that has led to countless wrongful convictions. I find the question \"Is that how an innocent person would act?\" as deeply troubling as \"Is that how a victim of an assault would act?\" \n\nAs to why a jury wouldn't want to hear all evidence available to them; yes, it's because they are conducting a sham trial.",

The ease of  catching a disc depends on the spin direction (forehand or backhand), disc angle (backhand arc or \"reverse curve\"), and disc orientation (normal top/bottom or an upside-down \"hammer\" throw).  And don't forget about speed.  Different throws require different catching techniques.   Since we're trying to throw the Frisbee (tm) Flying Disc (read: Impeachment Trial Facts) to the dog (read:  Undecided Public), rest assured that the angles, orientations, curves, and speeds of the presentation can vary.  Simple is find for one playing \"catch\", and dogs generally are pretty good at that.   But dogs make terrible Ultimate players (although, in fairness, they are pretty good at \"going long\").",

I think the GOP is stuck between the facts they don't want the public to know, and the fact that the public will know they are truly corrupt. \n\nOf course, Democrats have to put up a candidate that is moderate enough to appease the left and middle.

Democrats had every opportunity to call witnesses, but chose not to; and now, they want to use the Senate to complete their shoddy work. \n\nHere's a better question: If it has been demonstrated that Hunter Biden did not use the office of the vice presidency to enrich himself through corrupt foreign oligarchs, if he were truly innocent, why would Democrats be afraid for him to testify? If he's innocent as Dems have pushed, why not let him testify?",

He demeans women regularly, whether they're his opponent, a teenage climate change activist or a widow of a respected congressman. He commits adultery regularly and says that '35' is about the right age to date a woman (older may mean, time to get a new one). He threatens lawsuits to anyone that dare stand up to him and his lies and cheating. He thrives on getting his 'crowd' angry and hateful towards others. He has no regard for man, woman or this sacred planet. He sold out the Kurds to make sure his Trump Towers in Istanbul are more profitable and safe. He maybe the very worst we have to offer.

That is your interpretation of the situation,  not a fact.  Trump motivation might have been to start an investigation into Ukrainian corruption, which is acknowledged  by all as a serious problem.  It just so happens that Hunter Biden and his Dad appear to be part of that corruption.  Your failure to acknowledge destroys your argument.  Real money changed hands, and Joe coerced the former government to remove a prosecutor.  Those things happened, and if you had an once of integrity you would  be calling for Joe Biden to withdraw as a presidential nominee.

They don\u2019t understand that only sound bites work at moving opinion, and instead offer up cerebral arguments and logic that are tuned out. They learned nothing when the R\u2019s brought down Hilary simply by repeating, over and over again, \u201cLock her up!\u201d\nIf the Dems knew how to message, Trump by now would be afraid even to mention his border wall \u2014 because they would have repeated, over and over again, the simple sound bite \u201cHe broke his promise to make Mexico pay!\u201d Many simple variants thereof could have been used, all emphasizing that Trump lied, or failed. And soon he wouldn\u2019t talk about it anymore.\nSo Dems, don\u2019t blow another opportunity: Repeat Friedman\u2019s question, over and over again. That is the only argument you need to make.",

After this, there is a trial in which evidence and witnesses are called. It is this evidence that then forms the basis for jury's final decision.  This is the process that occurs in the Senate.\n\nFor some it would have made little difference, but there may have been some supporters of the President who would have seen that as being a process with which they are familiar and might have begun to question why witnesses were not being called.  \n\nUnfortunately, I believe the House leaders (i.e., Democrats) chose not to make it seem accessible in order not to diminish their role in the process.

Guilt loves company. It appears that Congressman Devin Nunes, ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, was involved in Trump's scheme. Are there others? Mike Pence seems to have been an accomplice. How about some of the senators, for example, Trump's golfing buddy Lindsey Graham? Or even Leader McConnell, whose wife is Secretary of Transportation? Even before Trump got his grubby hands on the GOP, it had become a criminal organization, suppressing votes, raising dirty money, and notoriously refusing to confirm a presidential appointee to the Supreme Court. So it seems possible, even likely, that McConnell, Graham and others gave their blessing to Trump's scheme to commit election interference through Ukraine.

While few rulers undertake the education plan Plato proposed, the founding fathers thought that some mechanisms for the separation and division of power would solve the problem. They failed.\nSo we now see Friedman's fall back position, putting good people in charge. This is also unreliable as we can see from American history, with presidents such as Bush or Nixon. \"Government of laws\" or \"government of men (people)\" -- these are inadequate slogans for solving the government crisis.

If the President was totally drunk that would not be criminal, but would disqualify him as an effective CEO of the U.S. Impeachment is more like firing an employee for incompetence or dishonesty. Many times the Senate has impeached judges for incompetence that was not criminal.\n\n2. Trump has admitted the charges. Clearly he has stonewalled the House on witnesses and documents. Trump demanded and requested Ukraine to announce an investigation of the Bidens, using impoundment of bipartisan appropriated military aid as a lever for personal gain in the 2020 election over his leading rival. Trump also called on China to dig up dirt on Biden while noting his leverage in the trade war and continued tariffs that China wants removed.\n\n3. Trump has over 15,000 documented lies so far since he became POTUS. Why trust someone bent on destroying Obamacare, denying climate change and spoiling to go to war with Iran? \n\n4. Trump disrespects many fine Americans, including immigrants, legal or illegal, Hispanics, African-Americans, women, LGBTQ and transexuals, young people, poor people, the FBI and US intelligence community, Democrats, military veterans like McCain, etc. The POTUS is supposed to serve all in the nation, not just those who voted for him.\n\n5. Trump acts like he is a king. We don't have kings in the U.S. Congress and the courts are independent checks on the power of Trump.",

It is, instead, the slippery slope toward authoritarianism.\n\nThe most sacred institution America has is the vote - one person, one vote. The Electoral College biases that toward small states, and subjects the country to their tyranny. That cannot be allowed to persist if we want to adhere to our traditional American values.\n\nIt's time for a direct election of the Presidency.

As long as he says what they want to hear about race, immigrants, LGBTQ rights, guns, abortion and climate change he remains their idol, regardless of the truth of any of his claims.  He recognizes that he can lie, on tape or video, deny that he made the lie, and still have his reputation unscathed.  He realizes that voters do not require that he have any modicum of integrity.  Republican Senators clearly have the same views.  They will follow Trump as he drags America and democracy into an abyss because they know that to do otherwise would be their political demise.  Voters who represent the worst of America now elect leaders who are the worst of America.  While I fervently hope there is a basis for your optimism, I fear it is misplaced.",

A grand jury has forwarded an inditement of the President to a court, judge and jury to hear. The foreman of the jury, Mr. McConnell, has said that he is working in close concert with the defendant and his legal team, that he wants to limit evidence and not allow witnesses, even those who refused to speak to the grand jury. Other jurors have stated that they aren't even pretending to be impartial, do not want to hear witnesses' testimony, and want to acquit the defendant as quickly as possible. The judge, now the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the land, is relegated to approving lunch breaks and swearing in the jury. If this was a TV show everyone would be talking about how unrealistic it is; this is not how trials are run. It's beyond me to understand how anyone can think this is an appropriate way to determine if our President has committed high crimes and misdemeanors against the people of this country. John Roberts, please, I beg you, stand up and force a semblance of legitimacy on this farce. Even as a republican President's appointee, you know this is not right.",

The two acts were (1) causing Ukraine to open a public investigation and (2) preventing aid from reaching Ukraine. It should be that the primary beneficiary of 2 was Trump, as the act labeled 2 was enacted to effect that labeled 1, which Trump wanted dearly. But why did he want that? Was it to the benefit of Ukraine? Yes, but 2 was not, except indirectly in that it caused 1. Was it to the benefit of the US? Probably not, and 2 frustrated agencies involved in supplying Ukraine with aid. Was it to the benefit of the Republican Party? Yes. Period.

It's easy to get lazy and turn your hand sideways, as if hand like a dog's head turned sideways and trying to pinch the frisbee like a wrench a nut. You can get away with that if constantly playing with a person who rotates the frisbee in a particular direction, which is to say you get used to the rotation and get lazy with hand position, but if you get used to playing with people who can rotate in both directions and especially if they throw powerfully you had better position your hand like a dog's head and get used to snatching the frisbee from the sky. I remember having had particular difficulty playing with a right-handed guy who was a superb athlete and who could throw a frisbee overhand, like a baseball or football with a powerful rotation to frisbee contrary to my usual expectation.

Since it would not be in the world's interest to allow that to happen, \u201cThey\" would not allow that to happen. Accounting would triumph where reality failed.

The same approach applies to the admission of the House hearing documents. But Mitch will hold the line on rejecting new witnesses and requests for White House documents. The vote on whether to subpoena John Bolton will likely provide a defining moment.\n\nIt's a delicate balance. Even the least-engaged Americans can be upset by demonstrations of crass unfairness. If the overwhelming appearance is that the impeachment process was simply a done deal from the very beginning, it could backfire on Trump and Mitch. So the theatrics of it demand creating some suspense and absorbing a few losses over secondary issues while locking down the vote on the things that matter. \n\nThe job of the Democrats is to raise as many high stakes process issues as possible and make sure each of them is publicly visible -- and to keep hammering home the essentially fraudulent nature of the Senate inquiry.",

There is no secret formula on how to win but it would help to emphasize that the Trump and the Republican senators are working together to withhold evidence. This strategy is just one of several that Democrats can use. Trump is vulnerable on environmental issues, both on climate change and toxic pollutants. People do care about their future and the future of their children and about their health. In addition Trump is vulnerable on foreign policy. He so far hasn't started a major war although he has come close and he hasn't done anything to end US military involvement in the Middle East and his policies seem to actually have benefited ISIS. And he seems to regard a US adversary, Russia, as a friend, and US allies in Europe as not being friends. There is a lot for voters to think about.

If you supported or voted for Trump, you were by definition irresponsible, foolish, naive, and/or--more likely--racially biased and misogynistic. If you voted for him, it is exceedingly unlikely you will be susceptible to shame, persuasion, admitting you were wrong, changing your mind. Just like the guy you voted for.\n\nIt's fine to say that the Democrats should strive to get witnesses and relevant documents introduced into the trial. But it is naive and possible even dangerous to count on persuading Trump voters to change their votes, and hoping that provides the difference this time. Ain't gonna happen. Forget about it. Instead, emphasize getting people who withheld their votes for Mrs. Clinton, who voted for a third party or didn't vote at all, plus people who are allowed to vote for the first time, to vote for the Democratic nominee this time--whoever she may be.",

They are getting some facts for a change instead of facts spun soothingly through rightwing media.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Republicans' exposure to both sides will change their minds, or whether it will inspire them to vote independently based on their conscience as opposed to what the party and its media operations demands.

I believe Trump should stipulate to all the evidence the House presents, and move for a directed verdict.  If the Senate is allowed to use subpoenas to seek additional information, impeachment would not be rare and solemn, it will be a political strategy.  A simple majority in the House and Senate could keep any president from being able to govern.  If Schumer had 51 votes, this trial could last 9 months.  After acquittal, the House could impeach again and again.  Impeachment could then be a tactic to stop the Supreme Court from being able to function.  The House should present there case, and if they can\u2019t convince 67 Senators to convict, the trial should end. If not, other attempts to impeach Trump will go on until he is out of office in a year, or 5.  A vote takes place in November.

Your point is right on target: keep repeating that mantra without any further comment, and possibly, in November, when it really matters enough people will do the right and most effective thing and vote him out of office!",

Perhaps more so as most people who are engaged enough to \"bother\" to vote in 2020 likely already have strong and firm opinions on Trump. \n\nThe Democrats need to repeatedly ask the following question too, from now to election day:\n\nWhy would a pro-democracy Party work so hard to cover up and excuse the \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" of a clearly guilty corrupt authoritarian President? \n\nThe answer is obvious: The Republican party does not believe in a fair and inclusive Democracy. Trump gets a pass because foreign interference in our elections is part of the Republican strategy to hold on to power, right along with voter suppression, extreme gerrymandering and the appointment of political hack judges to make sure they can get away with it.\n\nThis isn't a question of partisanship, it's a question of complicity. If you believe in our democracy voting against Trump is not enough, you need to also vote against the Party that has joined him in undermining our political institutions.",
