            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Anti-Israel Craze Hits High School A movement to \ndemonize Israel corrupts the academy. By Ammiel Hirsch and Joshua Davidson The \nauthors are rabbis. We recently spoke to some 500 high school students, teachers\n and administrators at Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the Bronx. As the \nsenior rabbis of two major Reform synagogues with which dozens of Fieldston \nfamilies are affiliated, we presented the Jewish community\u2019s perspectives on the\n surge in anti-Semitic incidents in our area and throughout the country. We \nclarified that while we do not claim to represent all Jews, our views do fall \nwithin mainstream Jewish opinion. We shared statistics from the New York City \npolice and the F.B.I. about the pervasiveness of attacks against Jews. We also \naddressed the controversy that had erupted in the aftermath of Fieldston\u2019s \nNovember assembly, in which a guest speaker equated Israelis with Nazis and \nasserted that Israelis are an example of \u201cvictims becoming the perpetrators.\u201d \nSeveral hours after we spoke last week, Fieldston fired a teacher who had posted\n tweets demonizing Zionism. Students reported that while we were speaking, the \nteacher flipped a middle finger at one of us. We are deeply worried about the \neffect that hatred of Israel has on students. We emphasized in our remarks that \nfor centuries, anti-Semitism emerged from both the right and the left of the \npolitical spectrum. We described what far-right anti-Semitism looks like, but, \nsince we are liberal rabbis, we spent most of our time discussing anti-Semitism \namong the left. It\u2019s especially important for us to speak against hate in our \nown camp. We stated emphatically that criticism of Israel is not necessarily \nanti-Semitic. To the contrary: it is often helpful and motivated by sound \nprinciples. But to accuse Holocaust survivors of inflicting Nazi-like violence \non others, as the guest speaker at Fieldston had, is morally grotesque. It \nwhitewashes the Nazis\u2019 crimes and who they really were to accuse Jews of the \nvery things that were done to them in an effort to defame the Jewish state. To \ndescribe Zionism as racism, to deny Israel\u2019s most basic right to exist, is anti-\nSemitic in effect, if not in intent. Why is Israel the only country in the world\n whose right to exist is not just questioned but actively campaigned against? \nIsrael\u2019s enemies protest that they are simply anti-Zionist, not anti-Semitic, \nyet their view of justice requires eliminating the one and only Jewish state. \nAnd they attack it with such venom. Their hatred of Israel is a primal loathing.\n The events at Fieldston have broad importance, and are reflective of a much \nbigger problem. Anti-Israel activism has spread beyond the college campus and \ninto the elementary and high school classroom. In Newton, Mass., a high school \ntaught that Israel was \u201cmurdering and torturing Palestinian women.\u201d In 2016, a \nPalestinian activist visiting an elementary school classroom in Ithaca, N.Y., \ninveighed against Israel and called on students to \u201cbe the freedom fighter\u201d for \nthe Palestinians. A hateful obsession with Israel too often descends into hatred\n of Jews, even if it doesn\u2019t start there. Hateful words lead to hateful deeds. \nThis environment produces, teaches, accelerates and normalizes anti-Semitism. \nAnti-Israel activity on some college campuses has led to verbal and even \nphysical assaults on Jewish students. And we must be honest with ourselves. It \nis happening in our space \u2014 in the heart of intellectual liberalism. Jewish \nparents should be especially worried. When teachers and professors turn the \nclassroom into an arena for anti-Israel animosity, students become unwitting \npawns instead of safeguarded learners. They should feel they can ask questions \nwithout fear of scorn, explore their own ideas and draw their own conclusions. \nAcademic malpractice is unfolding with too little pushback from parents and \ncommunity leaders. Schools need to respond \u2014 and so do the communities they \nserve \u2014 so that our children are not taught hateful views, but are instead \nimbued with the values of balanced inquiry, tolerance and the ability to take \npride in who they are and where they came from. It is our diversity that \nstrengthens society. Joshua Davidson is senior rabbi at Temple Emanu-El. Ammiel \nHirsch is senior rabbi at Stephen Wise Free Synagogue.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by I\u2019m a Liberal Who Thinks Immigration Must Be \nRestricted Immigration can invigorate the country. But when it is poorly \nmanaged, it can cause social division \u2014 just as it\u2019s doing right now. By Jerry \nKammer Mr. Kammer is a senior research fellow at the Center for Immigration \nStudies. In 2001, when I was the new Washington correspondent for The Arizona \nRepublic, I attended the annual awards dinner of the National Immigration Forum.\n The forum is a left-right coalition that lobbies for unauthorized immigrants \nand expansive immigration policies. Its board has included officials of the \nNational Council of La Raza, the American Civil Liberties Union and the American\n Immigration Lawyers Association, as well as the United States Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Restaurant Association and the American Nursery and \nLandscape Association. After dinner, the group\u2019s executive director, Frank \nSharry, made a pitch to business allies who wanted Congress to allow them \nunfettered access to foreign workers. \u201cYou guys in business get all the workers \nyou want, whenever you want them,\u201d he proposed. \u201cNo bureaucracy.\u201d \u201cSold!\u201d yelled\n John Gay, a lobbyist for the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Mr. Sharry\n quickly added that the deal must include advocacy for \u201cthree little, tiny \npieces of paper: a green card, a union card and a voter registration card\u201d for \nunauthorized immigrants. For me, a reporter who had long covered immigration in \nthe Southwest and Mexico, the exchange was a revelation about the politics of \nimmigration in Washington. Business lobbyists like Mr. Gay \u2014 conservatives who \nseek loose labor markets so employers can keep wages down \u2014 align themselves \nwith liberal activists like Frank Sharry to pursue policies that serve their \ngroups. Who, I wondered, was lobbying for the American workers competing with \nthe new arrivals? The answer, I learned, was no one. As the former labor \nsecretary Robert Reich once put it, \u201cThere\u2019s no National Association of Working \nPoor.\u201d This mismatch of political influence, combined with the social and fiscal\n consequences of a wave of low-skilled immigrants, led me to believe that \nimmigration should be restricted so that its power to invigorate our country is \nnot eclipsed by its potential to harm workers. I think immigration, like \ncapitalism itself, should be regulated in the national interest, not shaped to \nserve the free-market libertarianism of the right or the post-national \nhumanitarianism of the left. That\u2019s why I call myself a liberal restrictionist.I\n have long considered myself a moderate liberal, in part because Democrats have \nalways been the allies of working people. For many decades, liberals were \noutspoken in their alarm about illegal immigration. In 1970, Senator Walter \nMondale warned that \u201cwe have a massive poverty population coming into the \ncountry\u201d from Mexico. In 1983 a New York Times editorial argued that while the \ncountry needed immigrants, \u201cwhat it does not need is such an uncontrollable \nflood of illegal migrants that it tries public patience.\u201d In 1994, Barbara \nJordan, the civil rights icon chosen by President Bill Clinton to direct the \nFederal Commission on Immigration Reform, told Congress, \u201cAs a nation of \nimmigrants committed to the rule of law, this country must set limits on who can\n enter.\u201d In 2003, Hillary Clinton declared that she was \u201cadamantly against \nillegal immigration.\u201d But by the time Mrs. Clinton was running for president in \n2016, she was courting the Latino vote, pledging not to deport unauthorized \nimmigrants who did not have criminal records. Now many liberal Democrats, \nincluding those who call for the abolition of Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, seek to erase the distinction between legal and illegal \nimmigration. Under the banner of inclusiveness, equality, human rights, racial \nreconciliation and reparations for American interventions in the third world, \nthose liberals demand sanctuary for those who make it past the Border Patrol or \noverstay a visa. Few speak openly of open borders, but that is essentially what \nthey are calling for. Over the years, righteous outrage against restrictionists \nhas been fueled by some truly odious people. Lance Morrow of Time magazine \ndescribed the problem in 1980: \u201cKu Klux Klansmen have paraded around Florida \nlately, dispensing their old nativist bile and giving a bad name to an argument \n(\u2018America for Americans,\u2019 the picket signs say) that has more thoughtful and \nrespectable proponents.\u201d Today, President Trump has brought such outrage into \nthe mainstream with the repugnant charge that unauthorized immigrants \u201cinfest \nour country.\u201d But Mr. Trump does not deserve all the blame for our dysfunction. \nThe immigration debate has been warped by tribal passions on the left as well. \nWhat the left misses is that as Mr. Trump pursues his draconian efforts to stem \nthe tide, many Americans think he is fighting the good fight. They may be \ndismayed at his manic nastiness and his proclivity for crude insult. But they \nadmire his willingness to wage what they see as a patriotic battle to defend \ncommon people. Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the prominent liberal historian, believed\n that immigration restrictions were essential. He wrote in \u201cThe Disuniting of \nAmerica\u201d that while \u201cany curtailment of immigration offends something in the \nAmerican soul,\u201d it was also true that \u201cuncontrolled immigration is an \nimpossibility.\u201d President Ronald Reagan in 1986 proclaimed that he and Congress \nhad fulfilled that duty. He signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, \ncombining an amnesty with a program to stop future illegal immigration by \nrequiring employers to verify that their new hires were legal. The amnesty was \ndelivered. Work-site enforcement was not. Illegal immigration exploded. From \n1990 to 2007, the unauthorized population grew at an annual average of 500,000. \nIt reached a peak of 12.2 million in 2007, before falling to its present level \nof about 11 million. In 2004, as the national immigration reporter for the San \nDiego-based Copley newspaper chain, I returned to Arizona to report on \nProposition 200, a statewide ballot initiative to deny public services to \nunauthorized immigrants. Public anxiety had grown in tandem with the state\u2019s \nillegal immigrant population, which had jumped to 480,000 in 2005 from an \nestimated 88,000 in 1990. In Phoenix I spoke with Donna Neill, a volunteer \norganizer in a working-class neighborhood and the driving force in the \nconstruction of a park that was used primarily by immigrant children. \nNevertheless, she supported Proposition 200. She pointed to crowded classrooms, \napartments where two or three families crammed into a space meant for one and \nhome additions in violation of housing codes that went unenforced. \u201cWe\u2019re losing\n the simple things that make a society a society, but no one wants to step \nforward because they\u2019re afraid of crossing some line and being called a racist,\u201d\n said Ms. Neill. Despite a publicity campaign that branded the proposition as \nracist, it was approved by a large margin. Exit polls showed that 47 percent of \nLatino voters had supported it. \u201cPeople think they\u2019re driving down wages and \ntaking jobs,\u201d John Garcia, a professor of political science at the University of\n Arizona, told me. (Such concerns would later be overshadowed by Latinos\u2019 anger \nat a state law that targeted illegal immigration and by the neighborhood \n\u201csweeps\u201d orchestrated by Sheriff Joe Arpaio.) In 2008, I left the newspaper \nindustry. But the immigration story still tugged at me. I was fascinated by its \nhuman, political and moral complexity. I also wanted to push back against the \ncampaign by activist groups to label restrictionism as inherently racist. A year\n later, I became a researcher and writer for the Center for Immigration Studies,\n which seeks restrictions on immigration. I disagree with some of the center\u2019s \nhard-line positions. I favor a generous welcome for those who were brought here \nillegally as children and support comprehensive reform that would reprise the \n1986 amnesty-plus-enforcement compromise. But restrictionists are right to \ninsist that any new reform must guarantee work-site controls. They also make \nvalid points in pushing for a system of legal immigration like the one developed\n by Canada, which favors people with education and skills. No one understood the\n moral ambiguity of the immigration debate better than the historian and \nimmigration scholar John Higham. Higham was a liberal contrarian who observed \nthat while restrictionists \u201cclaimed to be the hard-boiled realists,\u201d their \nrealism \u201cwas seldom free of prejudice or hysteria.\u201d On the other side, \u201canti-\nrestrictionists tended to gloss over the dilemmas that immigration imposed.\u201d \nHigham urged adoption of the 1986 immigration legislation and was dismayed when \nit wasn\u2019t enforced. In the Higham archives at Johns Hopkins University, where he\n taught for many years, I found a letter in which he identified himself as \u201ca \nmild restrictionist.\u201d I like that label. It suggests the conciliatory spirit \nthat our country so badly needs. As the political divide around immigration \nintensified in the years before his death in 2003, Higham worried about the \nprospects for such a spirit. \u201cAre we experiencing, basically, an increasing \nindifference of people to one another, both within and between ethnic groups?\u201d \nhe wrote. \u201cIf so, immigration may prove to be just an aspect of a wider social \nfragmentation.\u201d Higham, it seems, anticipated the tempest now upon us.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by To Beat Trump, Put Ideals Before Ideas  Voters in \nthis presidential election are more concerned with the candidates\u2019 values than \ntheir proposals. By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist Democrats face a real \ndilemma: The current crop of their party\u2019s presidential candidates are awash in \nplans and proposals, which in theory is a good thing, but this election will not\n be decided on that basis. Donald Trump has transformed the electorate into two \ncamps, sycophants and dissidents, both passionate, both aimed like missiles at \nNovember, both with an intent desire to destroy the competition. This election \nwon\u2019t turn on the definition of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d or its funding mechanisms. It\n won\u2019t turn on who offers free college and to whom. This election will turn on \nwhether an individual voter sees Trump as a heroic savior or a destructive \nagent. This election is about fundamental questions of American ideals: Should \nforeign countries be invited or welcomed to meddle in our elections? Should a \npresident be allowed to openly obstruct justice without consequence? Should we \nseparate immigrant children from their parents and lock them in cages? Should we\n have a president who has bragged about assaulting women, paid off women who \nclaim to have been sexually involved with him and been accused by multiple women\n of being sexually inappropriate with them? Should America have a racist in the \nWhite House? It is issues like these, I believe, that will most animate voters \nin the election. America is being forced to look itself in the mirror and figure\n out who it is. And it seems to me that many of the Democratic candidates are \nmissing that base-level moral conflict, aiming over it or wiggling around it. \nThe moderate candidates pitch a path to victory to win back white people in the \nMidwest by being just milquetoast enough not to offend them and to cause them no\n guilt or consternation about having supported a racist, sexist, transphobe who \nlies about everything and honors nothing. The progressives promise us a future \nwith wholesale transformation in every sector: the economy, the military, the \nhealth care industry and education. They see a generational opportunity, indeed \nan existential emergency, to not only alter America\u2019s course, but in some cases \nto tear down sectors and rebuild them altogether. But their approaches, I fear, \nstray too far afield from where most Americans are. Voters simply want to get \nrid of Trump or to keep him. Liberal voters are not interested in candidates who\n kowtow to the white nationalists in the Rust Belt who not only voted for Trump \nbut still cheer for him. Whenever I hear candidates talking about their natural \nappeal to these voters, my spidey senses are activated. These are those who \ncheer for a man who saw \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d in Charlottesville, Va.\n These are people who see no problem with the separation of migrant families. \nThese are people who abide by the president employing white nationalists in his \nadministration. I am quite frankly suspicious of the candidate who actively \nappeals to these people. Their continued support for Trump isn\u2019t just some small\n mistake they made, like picking up a zucchini instead of a cucumber at the \nmarket. No, their Trump support is a value statement, one that turns on the \ndenial of other people\u2019s rights to freedom, equality and safe existence. How can\n a person appeal to me and to that person simultaneously and do so with \nintegrity and honor? At the same time, transformational change sounds good and \nsmart in theory, but it simply isn\u2019t most Trump-resisting Americans\u2019 most urgent\n concern. Removing Trump is. Furthermore, the federal government is notoriously \ninefficient and problem-prone. It would most likely take it decades to carry out\n a single large-scale change and tweak it until it worked properly. It is \nimpossible for me to believe that any candidate could manage major change in \nmultiple areas at the same time. This is not to say that the proposals of the \nprogressive candidates don\u2019t have merit. They do. Their goals are the right ones\n for the Democratic Party and the planet. But this election will not likely be \nthe proving ground for these proposals. In this cycle, it is hard to sell \nreorganizing the whole country to people who are simply afraid that Trump is \ngoing to destroy the whole country. That is a reason that Tuesday night\u2019s debate\n got a bit too far down into the weeds for me. Indeed, although the ability of \ncandidates to make sustained arguments has improved and the number of people \nallowed on the stage has shrunk, there remains a sort of nerdy gladiator feel to\n them that numbs with numbers. Trump has laid out his vision for America: It is \nthe racial Hunger Games. It is a dystopian future in which maximum pressure is \napplied to minority immigrants and trading partners, all to insulate the white \nworking class. Trump is the white nationalist candidate selling the racial \nromance of reverting America to a time when white workers were virtually \nguaranteed success and prosperity, often at the expense and exclusion of others.\n The Democratic candidates, too, would be well warned to stick to a vision \u2014 a \ndiametrically opposite and dynamically animating vision that will activate and \nenergize the targets of Trump\u2019s aggressions. If I see Trump as a pestilence I \nmay not see in your tome of plans a cure. The Times is committed to publishing a\n diversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Some Wins for the Women Just block Donald Trump out \nof your mind. By Gail Collins Opinion Columnist We\u2019ve spent a remarkable amount \nof time this week discussing whether there\u2019s sexism in politics. Hahahahaha \nO.K., no need to be cynical. Let\u2019s look on the positive side first. If you are \naround Elizabeth Warren\u2019s age of 70, you\u2019ve had the incredible luck to live \nthrough a period of history in which American women\u2019s rights and opportunities \nhave been transformed. There are still people alive who were born when women \ncouldn\u2019t vote. Now we\u2019ve got Nancy Pelosi giving a herd of male leaders their \nmarching orders in Congress. This doesn\u2019t mean all the battles are won. We\u2019ve \ngot only nine female governors, and a lot of people of both sexes really don\u2019t \nbelieve the country will elect any woman president. How you look at this depends\n a lot on why you think Hillary Clinton lost. Yes, she did get 2.8 million more \nvotes than Donald Trump. But we can\u2019t spend the day bewailing the existence of \nthe Electoral College. Back to the question. Why do you think she lost? \n\u201cSexism.\u201d \u201cFailure to campaign in Wisconsin.\u201d \u201cShe won! She won! She won! She \n\u2014\u2014\u201d Sorry about that sharp elbow, but I told you we weren\u2019t going there. Next \nyou\u2019re going to be moaning about Al Gore. \u201cAl Gore won!\u201d That\u2019s it. Unless you \nhave a special interest in the election of Benjamin Harrison. \u201cGrover Cleveland \nwas robbed!\u201d You understand we need to move on here, right? Personally, I\u2019ve \nalways suspected that Clinton lost \u2014 to the degree that she lost \u2014 not so much \nbecause of her gender as because people just wanted a change. She\u2019d been a \nstarring player in two eight-year administrations. It was pretty clear what we \nwere going to get in another Clinton presidency, and it wasn\u2019t going to be \nanything dramatically new. (This is what happens when you get a little bit bored\n with life and decide you want to juice things up. You spend $50,000 on a new \nsports car and then drive it into a restaurant takeout window. Or far worse, you\n elect Donald Trump.) The whole can-a-woman-be-president issue came up during \nthis week\u2019s debate. Warren had one of her best moments when she pointed out that\n the male candidates with whom she shared the stage had collectively lost 10 \nelections, while the women hadn\u2019t lost a single one. And besides, she added, she\n was the only person onstage who had defeated an incumbent Republican in the \nlast 30 years. Bernie Sanders \u2014 who contributed seven of those losses \u2014 quickly \nvolunteered that he had beaten a Republican incumbent in 1990. Which Warren, \ndespite her career as a primary-school teacher, claimed was not within the last \n30 years. Joe Biden didn\u2019t point out that he beat a Republican incumbent to win \nhis Senate seat in 1972. This is worth mentioning since some people worry that \none of the Democrats\u2019 leading candidates seems to kind of be living in the past.\n About Joe Biden. This is his third run for president. Who among us could forget\n 2008, when he came in fifth in Iowa and dropped out? Or 1988, when he \u2014 O.K., \nyou did forget 1988. Totally understand. Biden hasn\u2019t had any super disasters in\n the debates. Well, there was the time in October when he said: \u201cI would \neliminate the capital gains tax \u2014 I would raise the capital gains tax to the \nhighest rate, of 39.5 percent.\u201d And that time in November when he spoke out \nagainst violence against women, adding that \u201cwe have to just change the culture \n\u2026 and keep punching at it and punching at it.\u201d Details, details. This last \nperformance was pretty clean and Biden got fairly good reviews, many of which \nboiled down to how he\u2019d gotten through the evening \u201cwithout taking major \ndamage.\u201d Can we all agree that no female candidate could ever get away with \nstuff like that and then win praise for not saying anything stranger? When it \ncomes to gender bias, in the past Biden agreed that Clinton faced it to an \n\u201cunfair\u201d degree. Then he added, \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen with me.\u201d His \ncampaign later claimed that his statement did not, um, mean what it sort of \nsounded like it meant. So, about sexism in politics. Absolutely there, \nespecially at the highest levels. But dissolving rapidly in places where women \nare proving what terrific vote-getters they are. We have 26 women in the Senate \nnow \u2014 nearly half the all-of-American-history total. Seventeen are Democrats.  \nThis little detail gives us an opportunity to recall the days when the \nRepublican Party was progressive enough to have serious arguments about whether \na woman could win the presidency. Remember the glorious Senator Margaret Chase \nSmith? She ran for the nomination in 1964, when she was 66. A columnist for The \nLos Angeles Times argued that she was too old and added that when women hit the \nideal age for running in their late 40s or early 50s, they are utterly unfit for\n office, since they are undergoing the \u201cphysical changes and emotional distress\u201d\n of menopause. So you have to admit things have been getting better. For women, \nthat is. We\u2019ve still got Donald Trump. Sorry, nation.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Why the Warren and Sanders Spat Matters Everyone is \nvery online and very upset. By Spencer Bokat-Lindell Mr. Bokat-Lindell is a \nwriter for Times Opinion. This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You \ncan sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays. Two days after the \nfragile peace holding the country\u2019s progressive coalition together collapsed on \nnational television, a number of questions remain: Did Bernie Sanders really \ntell Elizabeth Warren in a private meeting in 2018 that a woman couldn\u2019t win the\n presidency? Did Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign deliberately leak this unverifiable story\n 13 months after the fact in an effort to undermine Mr. Sanders? Why is John \nDelaney still running? The world may never know. But what the world lacks in \nknowledge it more than makes up for in opinion. Here\u2019s how people are responding\n to the dust-up and the larger conversation about sexism in politics. \u2018A self-\nfulfilling prophecy\u2019 Whether Mr. Sanders did or didn\u2019t say what Ms. Warren \nremembers him saying is beside the point, writes Rebecca Traister, which is that\n there are \u201ccomplicated, painful, difficult dynamics that have kept women from \nthe presidency for the country\u2019s entire history.\u201d One of those dynamics, she \nargues, is how even talking about the fact of sexism becomes a trap for women, \none that Ms. Warren had, until recently, avoided. Worth noting: As the Times \ncolumnist Frank Bruni has pointed out, and as Mr. Sanders himself said in \nTuesday\u2019s debate, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016 by nearly three \nmillion votes. And when it comes to swing states, \u201cthere\u2019s no empirical evidence\n that you could lump in a whole region and say that women have not, or will not,\n fare well there,\u201d the political scientist Kelly Dittmar told Vox\u2019s Li Zhou. At \nthe same time, 8 percent of Americans say they would not vote for a woman, \naccording to a 2015 Gallup poll. Men and women alike experience \u201cfeelings of \nmoral outrage,\u201d such as contempt, anger and disgust, when told a female \npolitician is ambitious, according to research Michelle Cottle cites in The \nTimes. So it is not sexist, Ms. Traister writes, to acknowledge, as Mr. Sanders \nsays he remembers doing, that female candidates face a \u201creal-life, genuine set \nof challenges.\u201d But the discourse of \u201celectability,\u201d she adds, can also end up \nbuttressing the same sexist reality that it means to condemn: \u201cIf we worry so \nmuch about whether we can elect a woman that it guides our choices, what we get \nis self-fulfilling prophecy, a future that looks like our past.\u201d There are \nnuanced, difficult conversations to be had about what it means to have a woman \nrunning again, writes Bridget Read, but they\u2019re not the ones actually being had.\n \u201cInstead, the topic was wielded as a cudgel, hijacked for maximum provocation,\u201d\n she writes. \u201cMeanwhile, the terrifying factions of people who don\u2019t want women \nanywhere near the halls of power, who don\u2019t want anything to change, are patting\n themselves on the back somewhere, thrilled that we\u2019re doing their work for \nthem.\" \u201cWanting a woman to rise to the top of an almost all-male pack is not a \nposition that needs defending,\u201d writes Brittney Cooper, a Rutgers professor. \n\u201cWhat should be defended is the uncritical desire to elect yet another man to a \nposition that 45 men and zero women have held.\u201d \u2018Bernie Boneheads and Liz Losers\n Unite!\u2019 It\u2019s probable that neither Mr. Sanders nor Ms. Warren is lying, tweeted\n the lawyer and author Rabia Chaudry. \u201cHis comment likely had a particular \ncontext, and she heard it in a particular way. This is literally how human \ninteraction often works when people end up with misunderstandings,\u201d she wrote. \nGiven the impossibility of determining what happened during the meeting, the \ninternecine conflict can only hurt the progressive movement, argues Eric Levitz,\n for three reasons: \u201cThere are not very many people in this country who are \neager to spend copious amounts of time, money and attention on progressive \npolitics.\u201d \"There are not very many politicians in America who are as responsive\n to the demands and desires of such people as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth \nWarren.\u201d \u201cAs a consequence of the first two points, Bernie and Warren supporters\n cannot win much of anything without each other.\" The labor leader Sara Nelson, \npresident of the Association of Flight Attendants-C.W.A., took a similar line. \n\u201cThese new hostilities have been needled and fostered by people who want to \nmaintain control in this current system,\u201d she told Sam Adler-Bell at The \nIntercept. \u201cStop beating up on each other, figure out how to find common ground,\n and get back to talking about the issues that matter, like health care, the \ndignity of all work and the existential threat of climate crisis.\u201d The \ncandidates, however, have not offered a sterling example of solidarity, writes \nAmy Davidson Sorkin in The New Yorker. During the debate, a CNN moderator \nappeared to blatantly side with Ms. Warren\u2019s version of events after Mr. Sanders\n denied it. At that point, \u201cit was not Warren\u2019s job, of course, to be \nconciliatory, when Sanders himself had said that her account was false,\u201d Ms. \nDavidson Sorkin writes. At the same time, his own account of the meeting did \noffer Warren \u201can opening that she shut off.\u201d The biggest beneficiary of this \nrift is Joe Biden, writes Arwa Mahdawi. \u201cHe\u2019s doing to his best to stay out of \nthe news, as much as his gaffes will allow, and to maintain his front-runner \nstatus.\u201d The Times reporter Astead Herndon also pointed out on Twitter: \u2018A \ncredibility issue\u2019 \u201cThis controversy has resurfaced some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s past \nwomen troubles,\u201d writes Ms. Cottle. She notes that his 2016 campaign staff faced\n sexual harassment allegations, which last year he said he was too busy to \nnotice but recently, in an interview in The Times, he declared \u201cdisgusted\u201d him. \n\u201cIt also doesn\u2019t help that the Bernie Bros, a segment of Mr. Sanders\u2019s most \nanimated supporters, are famous for their aggressive, at times abusive, behavior\n toward his opponents and critics, earning a reputation for toxic machismo,\u201d she\n adds. The writer Moira Donegan explicitly linked the rhetoric some of Mr. \nSanders\u2019s supporters have used about Ms. Warren to that used against victims of \nsexual assault: But many on the left have taken issue with the comparison, \nincluding The Times writer Elizabeth Bruenig, a supporter of Mr. Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m \nnot a Bernie Bro, I\u2019m an adult woman who has dealt with sexism and misogyny in \nmy personal life and in my professional life,\u201d she wrote in a since deleted \ntweet. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate its cynical deployments, and I especially detest the \nexploitation of rhetoric around sexual assault in this context.\u201d \u201cWarren has a \ncredibility issue, and it\u2019s not sexist to point that out,\u201d wrote Rebecca Nagle, \na writer and member of the Cherokee nation, bringing up Ms. Warren\u2019s false \nclaims of Cherokee heritage (for which she has since apologized). Ms. Nagle \ntweeted: Do you have a point of view we missed? Email us at \ndebatable@nytimes.com. Please note your name, age and location in your response,\n which may be included in the next newsletter. VIEWS FROM THE RIGHT \u201cWarren \nneeds to stop treating Sanders like a friend who needs to be sheltered from \ncriticism,\u201d writes Jennifer Rubin. \u201cHe should not be allowed to skate by, \nimplicitly calling Warren a liar.\u201d [The Washington Post] \u201cThe Democratic Party, \nwhich \u2014 because there is, in the end, justice in this world \u2014 is coming apart \nbefore our eyes,\u201d writes Tucker Carlson. \u201cWhat a spectacle it is!\u201d [Fox] \u201cI get \nwhy cable TV thinks this is a \u2018great\u2019 story,\u201d tweeted David Frum. \u201cBut in the \nscheme of things, it\u2019s high school drama \u2014 and that it is being elevated by \nelements of the cable industry says a lot about why we\u2019re in such trouble.\u201d \n\u201cElizabeth Warren is ruining the case for a female president,\u201d writes Kimberly \nRoss.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Why Does America Hate Its Children? Reasons child \ncare should be a key election issue. By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist The other\n day a correspondent asked me a good question: What important issue aren\u2019t we \ntalking about? My answer, after some reflection, is the state of America\u2019s \nchildren. Now, it\u2019s not entirely fair to say that we\u2019re ignoring the plight of \nour children. Elizabeth Warren, characteristically, has laid out a \ncomprehensive, fully financed plan for universal child care. Bernie Sanders, \nalso characteristically, says he\u2019s for it but hasn\u2019t provided details. And as \nfar as I can tell, all the other Democratic presidential candidates support \ndoing more for children. But policy toward children has attracted far less media\n attention than the debate over \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d which won\u2019t become reality \nanytime soon \u2014 let alone the so-called Warren-Sanders \u201cspat.\u201d And my guess is \nthat even well-informed voters have little sense of the grim exceptionalism of \nAmerica\u2019s child-oriented policies, which are Dickensian compared with those of \nevery other advanced country. A few numbers may be in order here. Every advanced\n country mandates some form of paid leave for new mothers, typically three or \nfour months \u2014 every country, that is, except America, which offers no maternity \nleave at all. Most advanced countries devote substantial sums to benefits for \nfamilies with children; in Europe these benefits average between 2 and 3 percent\n of G.D.P. The corresponding number for the United States is 0.6 percent of \nG.D.P. Even where the United States does help children, the quality of that help\n tends to be poor. There have been many comparisons between French and American \nschool lunches: French schoolchildren are taught to eat healthy meals; American \nchildren are basically treated as a disposal site for farm surpluses. What\u2019s \nespecially striking is the contrast between the way we treat our children and \nthe way we treat our senior citizens. Social Security isn\u2019t all that generous \u2014 \nthere\u2019s a good case for expanding it \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t compare too badly with \nother countries\u2019 retirement systems. Medicare actually spends lavishly compared \nwith single-payer systems elsewhere. So America\u2019s refusal to help children isn\u2019t\n part of a broad opposition to government programs; we single out children for \nespecially harsh treatment. Why? The answer, I\u2019d suggest, goes beyond the fact \nthat children can\u2019t vote, while seniors can and do. There has also been a \npoisonous interaction between racial antagonism and bad social analysis. These \ndays, political support for programs that aid children is surely hurt by the \nfact that less than half the population under 15 is non-Hispanic white. But even\n before immigration transformed America\u2019s ethnic landscape, there was a \nwidespread perception that programs like Aid to Families With Dependent Children\n basically helped Those People \u2014 you know, the bums on welfare, the welfare \nqueens driving Cadillacs. This perception undermined support for spending on \nchildren. And it went along with a widespread belief that aid to poor families \nwas creating a culture of dependency, which in turn was the culprit behind \nsocial collapse in America\u2019s inner cities. Partly in response, aid to families, \nsuch as it was, increasingly came with work requirements, or took the form of \nthings like the earned-income tax credit, which is linked to earnings. The \nresult was a decline in assistance for the poor children who needed it most. At \nthis point, however, we know that cultural explanations of social collapse were \nall wrong. The sociologist William Julius Wilson argued long ago that social \ndysfunction in big cities was caused, not by culture, but by the disappearance \nof good jobs. And he has been vindicated by what happened to much of the \nAmerican heartland, which suffered a similar disappearance of good jobs and a \nsimilar surge in social dysfunction. What this means is that we\u2019ve established a\n basically vicious system under which children can\u2019t get the help they need \nunless their parents find jobs that don\u2019t exist. And a growing body of evidence \nsays that this system is destructive as well as cruel. Multiple studies have \nfound that safety-net programs for children have big long-term consequences. \nChildren who receive adequate nutrition and health care grow up to become \nhealthier, more productive adults. And in addition to the humanitarian side of \nthese benefits, there\u2019s a monetary payoff: Healthier adults are less likely to \nneed public aid and are likely to pay more in taxes. It\u2019s probably too much to \nclaim that helping children pays for itself. But it surely comes a lot closer to\n doing so than tax cuts for the rich. So we should be talking a lot more about \nhelping America\u2019s children. Why aren\u2019t we? At least part of the blame rests with\n Bernie Sanders, who made Medicare for All both a progressive purity test and a \nbright shiny object chased by the news media at the expense of other policies \nthat could greatly improve American lives, and are far more likely to become \nlaw. But it\u2019s not too late to refocus. Whoever becomes the Democratic nominee, I\n hope he or she will give our nation\u2019s shameful treatment of children the \nattention it deserves.

A decade encompasses two of China\u2019s famous five-year plans, \nand it\u2019s a long-enough period to notice real changes in a country\u2019s trajectory. \nAs it happens, I spent time in China at both ends of the decade that just ended,\n first in 2010 and again recently. And I was left with one main conclusion: \nChina has just enjoyed a very good decade. Yes, it still has big problems, \nincluding the protests in Hong Kong. But by the standards that matter most to \nChina\u2019s leaders, the country made major gains during the 2010s. Its economy is \nmore diversified. Its scientific community is more advanced, and its \nsurveillance state more powerful. Its position in Asia is stronger. China, in \nshort, has done substantially more to close the gap with the global power that \nit is chasing \u2014 the United States \u2014 than seemed likely a decade ago. Many \nAmericans, of course, understand that China is on the rise and are anxious about\n it. Yet I also returned from my trip thinking that this American anxiety tends \nto be misplaced in one crucial way: China is not preordained to supplant or even\n match the United States as the world\u2019s leading power. China\u2019s challenges are \nreal, not just the protests in Hong Kong but also the dissent in Xinjiang and \nTibet, the bloat in its state-run companies and the looming decline in its \nworking-age population. The No. 1 reason China has made such stark progress in \ngeopolitical terms is that its rival just endured a bad decade by virtually \nevery measure. While China takes more steps forward than backward, the United \nStates is moving slowly in reverse. Incomes, wealth and life expectancy in the \nUnited States have stagnated for much of the population, contributing to an \nangry national mood and exacerbating political divisions. The result is a \nsemidysfunctional government that is eroding many of the country\u2019s largest \nadvantages over China. The United States is skimping on the investments like \neducation, science and infrastructure that helped make it the world\u2019s great \npower. It is also forfeiting the soft power that has been a core part of \nAmerican pre-eminence. President Trump plays a telling role here. More so than \nhis predecessors, he has been willing to treat China as the strategic threat \nthat it is. Yet he is confronting it so ham-handedly as to strengthen China. \nInstead of building a coalition to manage its rise \u2014 including the Asian nations\n in China\u2019s shadow \u2014 Trump is alienating allies. Instead of celebrating \ndemocracy as an alternative to Chinese authoritarianism, he is denigrating the \nrule of law at home and cozying up to dictators abroad. Trump, as Keyu Jin, a \nChinese economist at the London School of Economics, says, is \u201ca strategic gift\u201d\n for China. The recent trade spat is an example. The Trump administration was \nright to take a tougher line. But after imposing unilateral sanctions, Trump \nthen accepted a truce that did not do much to address the core problems, like \nChina\u2019s corporate subsidies. The current version of the United States doesn\u2019t \nseem to know quite what it is \u2014 global democratic leader or parochial self-\nprotector \u2014 and the confusion benefits China. After the Trump administration \nthis year asked 61 countries to bar Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications \ncompany, the response was embarrassing: Only three have done so. President \nEmmanuel Macron of France now argues that Europe should position itself as a \nthird global power between the United States and China, rather than what it has \nbeen \u2014 an American ally. There is an unending debate among China experts about \nwhether the country is weak or strong. The answer is that it\u2019s both. But its \ndirection is clear. China continues to become stronger. The maturing of the \neconomy felt particularly striking to me as I compared my two visits. Although \ngrowth has slowed, from about 10 percent a year at the decade\u2019s start to less \nthan 7 percent now, part of that slowdown was inevitable, as the country became \nless poor. The encouraging news for China is that, as Neil Shen, the founding \npartner of the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital China, says, \u201cthe quality of\n the growth has been much improved.\u201d When I talked with Chinese leaders and \nbusiness executives in 2010, they spent a lot of time lamenting two problems \u2014 a\n lack of innovative companies and a low level of consumer spending. I didn\u2019t \nhear those laments this time. Today, China is home to perhaps the world\u2019s \nhottest social media app, TikTok, which is more popular than Facebook among \nAmerican teenagers, according to a recent survey. Other innovators are likely to\n follow, because China\u2019s digital economy now has some advantages that not even \nthe American version does. Instead of being fragmented among dozens of apps \u2014 \none for Starbucks, others for Amazon and airlines and so on \u2014 much of Chinese \ncommerce happens within one of two digital networks \u2014 WeChat Pay and Alipay. \nPeople open one app and can pay for almost anything, in stores or online. The \nsimplicity encourages further retail innovations, and Facebook and Google are \ntrying to mimic this model. It feels like the future of commerce. It\u2019s also part\n of a larger advance in China\u2019s consumer economy. Consumer spending now accounts\n for about 39 percent of China\u2019s G.D.P., up from a low of 35 percent in 2010. \nThe word \u201cconsumerism\u201d may have negative connotations in the United States, \nwhere such spending accounts for about 68 percent of G.D.P., but it means \nsomething quite different in recently poor countries. It signifies a shift away \nfrom an economy dominated by sustenance farming and smokestacks and toward the \ncomforts of modern life. One of my stops was Nanjing, China\u2019s 12th-largest city,\n best known to outsiders as the site of a civilian massacre by Japanese troops \nin the 1930s. That history makes the city a symbol of the humiliations China \nsuffered for much of the 20th century. Those humiliations continue to shape pop \nculture; a remarkable share of contemporary television shows cast the Japanese \nmilitary as villains. More quietly, though, Nanjing embodies the growth of a \nmiddle-class consumer culture. The city\u2019s subway system opened only 14 years ago\n and now transports one billion riders a year. It\u2019s clean and bustling, and the \ntrips I took each cost either 2 or 3 yuan (about 28 cents or 42 cents). \nNationwide, almost 30 other cities have opened subways since Nanjing did, giving\n China the world\u2019s largest subway ridership. Nanjing is also one of the stops on\n the high-speed train line that opened between Shanghai and Beijing in 2011. \nNanjing is roughly as far from Beijing as New York is from Cincinnati, and the \nexpress train takes less than four hours. This infrastructure makes all kinds of\n economic activity easier \u2014 commuting to work, taking vacations or simply going \nshopping. On a recent Saturday night at Nanjing\u2019s seven-story Deji Plaza mall, \nthe restaurants were packed, as were the aisles at Uniqlo, even at 9 p.m. Beyond\n the economy, China has also made stark progress in other areas over the past \ndecade. It is close to becoming the world\u2019s leading funder of scientific \nresearch and development, thanks to soaring increases in China and meager ones \nin the United States. The quality of American science remains higher, but the \ngap has narrowed. China\u2019s military has also become stronger. China is now the \nlargest trading partner not only of Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and \nIndonesia but also of Australia, Brazil and South Africa. And start-up companies\n have become dynamic enough to lure a growing number of Chinese graduates of \nAmerican universities to return home, Matthew Slaughter, the dean of Dartmouth\u2019s\n Tuck School of Business, told me \u2014 shortly after he had attended an alumni \nevent in Beijing. Increasingly, this trade brings cultural and political sway. \nJust look at the National Basketball Association\u2019s awkward attempts to placate \nChina after a Houston Rockets executive dared to post a Twitter message (quickly\n deleted) expressing support for Hong Kong protesters. N.B.A. officials \nunderstood, as many other corporate executives do, that Beijing effectively \nholds veto power over their plans for growth. China\u2019s leaders, in turn, have \nstarted shedding the humility that had characterized much of their foreign \npolicy since Deng. At a recent conference I attended on the outskirts of \nBeijing, with Bill Gates, Henry Kissinger, Henry Paulson and many American \nofficials and executives, the swagger of the Chinese officials was notable. Some\n of the Americans delivered blunt criticism of China\u2019s economic policy. Chinese \nofficials largely ignored the complaints. \u201cWe Chinese people know very well what\n we have, what we want and what it takes,\u201d Wang Qishan, China\u2019s vice president, \ntold the conference, the New Economy Forum. \u201cWe have the confidence, patience \nand resolve to realize our goal of great national rejuvenation.\u201d China has now \nexceeded the world\u2019s expectations for three decades in a row \u2014 which, of course,\n does not guarantee that the streak will continue in this new decade. China \nstill has a long way to go. Its foreign policy will be made more difficult by \nthe growing wariness of China\u2019s power in other countries. Its economy will have \nto cope with debts from its building boom, and President Xi Jinping\u2019s support \nfor politically obedient \u2014 but often inefficient \u2014 state-managed companies isn\u2019t\n helping. The sharp decline in the working-age population over the next quarter-\ncentury, thanks to the old one-child policy, will probably present China\u2019s \nbiggest challenge since the 1989 democracy movement. A decade from now, I can \neasily imagine China as an even stronger rival to the United States \u2014 dominating\n its Pacific realm and leading a loose global coalition of authoritarian states \n\u2014 or as a weaker one, struggling to manage internal dissent and tensions with \nits Asian neighbors. But the United States should feel some urgency about the \npossibility of the first scenario. On my last day in Beijing, I visited the \nForbidden City, the complex of old imperial palaces, which Xi has ordered \nspruced up, in part to remind people that a powerful China is the historical \nnorm. To make sense of the trip, I sat down in a courtyard and looked back at \ntwo lists that I had made during my 2010 visit. One summarized the steps that \nChina needed to take in the years ahead to become stronger \u2014 increasing consumer\n spending, strengthening its scientific sector, becoming more innovative and so \non. The other listed the steps the United States should take to stay strong \u2014 \nlike reducing inequality and investing more in the future. The contrast, between\n progress and stagnation, was clear. I think the rational conclusion is to be \nworried about the future of American power. The Times is committed to publishing\n a diversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by \u2018The View\u2019 Has a Meghan McCain Problem The daytime \nco-hosts\u2019 heated bipartisan debates are played down as disagreement among \nfriends. But the strain for \u201ccivility\u201d is tiring. By Shamira Ibrahim Ms. Ibrahim\n is a culture writer and reporter. During an episode of \u201cThe View\u201d this month, \nSenator Elizabeth Warren explained her wealth tax plan for the top one-tenth of \nthe 1 percent. Some viewers were quick to notice the presidential candidate\u2019s \nsly and effective tactic while doing so: a deft rebuffing of the co-host Meghan \nMcCain\u2019s multiple attempts to interject. Ms. Warren never skipped a beat while \nignoring Ms. McCain until she was prepared to engage in discussion with her on \nher own terms, to raucous applause. Ms. Warren seemed to know what she would be \nup against when appearing on the long-running daytime talk show. Since Ms. \nMcCain, a conservative, joined as a co-host on \u201cThe View\u201d in October of 2017, \nshe has become its most polarizing and predictable figure, the common \ndenominator in the show\u2019s most contentious round tables. In the early days after\n her arrival, her on-air spats made for fun TV. Now it\u2019s just exhausting. It has\n become the norm to watch Ms. McCain, the daughter of Senator John McCain, \nsquare off against her co-hosts in a barrage of vehement exchanges \u2014 leveraging \nher political parentage, accusing her co-hosts of supporting infanticide, using \nher platform to push back against assault weapons bans and progressive \nimmigration policy. The increasingly aggressive rejoinders by her co-hosts have \nescalated to the daytime TV equivalent of a cage fight for the viewing public, \nreflecting the frustrations of discourse in our current political climate under \nthe magnifying glass of harsh studio lighting. That tension could be taking a \ntoll behind the scenes. On Monday, the conservative co-host Abby Huntsman \nannounced her immediate departure from the show, citing plans to work on the \ncampaign of her father, Jon Huntsman Jr., for governor in Utah. But it has been \nsuggested that the move was also fueled by rumored discord between Ms. Huntsman \nand Ms. McCain, who were once considered to be allies on the set. (Ms. McCain \nhas wished Ms. Huntsman \u201cnothing but the best on her next chapter.\u201d) For some \nviewers, Ms. McCain is the privileged product of conservative nepotism, \ncapitalism and the American military-industrial complex. That coalescence \nnaturally renders her a villain to progressives, who envision her as the \ncathartic personification of a punching bag on social media. Conversely, each \npile-on reinforces her self-written narrative of the long-suffering victim of \ncensorship. This dynamic is a high-wire act that Ms. McCain takes pains to use \nto her advantage as often as possible. When she appeared on the late-night talk \nshow \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d in September, she informed the host, Andy Cohen, \nthat every day she assumes she could get fired, because of \u201cthe tone of where we\n are culturally.\u201d It\u2019s a deflecting refrain that has been employed by standup \ncomedians and political commentators alike \u2014 anyone bemoaning the rise of so-\ncalled cancel culture when facing pushback for harmful rhetoric. And in \nDecember, when her co-host Whoopi Goldberg sharply told Ms. McCain, \u201cGirl, \nplease stop talking,\u201d Ms. McCain took to Twitter the next day to rally \u201call the \nfellow conservative \u2018girls\u2019 who won\u2019t be quiet.\u201d The tweet was accompanied by a \n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Mother of Dragons GIF, implying that Ms. Goldberg\u2019s use of the\n word \u201cgirl\u201d was infantilizing rather than common black American parlance. The \ninjection of vitriol undercuts the substantive political critique that is \nsupposed to occur during these segments. Every combative segment is immediately \ncountered by a claim that it\u2019s all just a harmless debate among friends, making \nthe ostensibly organic on-air confrontations seem all the more performative, no \nmatter how genuine the sentiment. The day after that particular clash with Ms. \nMcCain, Ms. Goldberg opened the show by insisting that the nature of their \nexchange was nothing of concern, noting that co-hosts on \u201cThe View\u201d have always \n\u201cclashed and gone back and forth.\u201d Ms. McCain, for her part, reminded everyone \nthat this is to be expected, as she is \u201chyper, hyper conservative.\u201d This \u201cagree \nto disagree\u201d stance is frustrating and lies in stark contrast with the current \npolitical moment, when many are skeptical of the idea of civil discourse and who\n it is meant to benefit. To be fair, \u201cThe View\u201d has had its fair share of \nfriction during the course of its two-decade run. Since its 1997 debut, the show\n has gone through nearly as many permanent co-hosts \u2014 22 \u2014 as it has seasons, \nwhile representing a wide range of backgrounds and ideologies, including the \nprosecutor-turned-\u201cCourt TV\u201d sensation Star Jones, the conservative \u201cSurvivor\u201d \nalum Elisabeth Hasselbeck and the anti-vaccine activist Jenny McCarthy. \nInfamously, Ms. Hasselbeck and the show\u2019s co-creator and co-star Barbara Walters\n argued about women\u2019s reproductive rights on air, prompting a behind-the-scenes \nfiasco where Ms. Hasselbeck almost quit in mid-show. But compared with the \nconflicts with the current hosts and Ms. McCain, the on-air tenor was not nearly\n as fraught, and the audience not nearly as reactive to the pushback. For years,\n the program has held tight to the idea of \u201ccivil disagreement,\u201d embracing the \nneed for debate and Ms. Walters\u2019s original vision of bringing people to the \ntable with different backgrounds and views. In truth, nothing about these recent\n viral incidents is either civil or revelatory, no matter how many avowals are \nmade to that effect. And there\u2019s a sense that some of the audience \u2014 which in \nrecent years has included women in the 25-to-54 demographic watching at home and\n those who view the viral clips online \u2014 is growing increasingly weary of the \nfarce. (Someone has created a Change.org petition to replace Ms. McCain with the\n frequent contributor and fellow conservative Ana Navarro, who has been \ncelebrated for her moments sparring with Ms. McCain. As I write this, it has \nclose to 9,000 signees and counting.) In many ways, it echoes the comedian Jon \nStewart\u2019s notable 2004 appearance on the CNN show \u201cCrossfire.\u201d Mr. Stewart \nharangued the hosts \u2014 the liberal Paul Begala and the conservative Tucker \nCarlson \u2014 and accused them of being hacks. He argued that their performance of \nbipartisan debate only served the politicians and corporations, as opposed to \ntheir audience, who he believed deserved to be informed and assuaged of their \npalpable anxiety. \u201cTo do a debate would be great,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cBut that\u2019s\n like saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition.\u201d In the \nearliest episodes of \u201cThe View,\u201d Ms. Walters would sign off with a line that \nremains a part of the brand to this day: \u201cHave a great day, everyone, and take a\n little time to enjoy the view.\u201d At the time, the show set the standard for a \nnew era of women\u2019s variety programming, one that embraced public debate, but \nstill operated with the veneer of civility. Post-2016, we are presented with a \nplatform that is devoid of the varnish of the genteel, yet is still asking us to\n take a little time to enjoy the view. The problem is, with Ms. McCain still on \nthe show, there\u2019s not much to enjoy. Shamira Ibrahim (@_ShamGod) is a culture \nwriter and reporter based in Brooklyn.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Who Will Be Left Standing in the Supreme Court? The \nTrump administration is doing its best to kick plaintiffs out of lawsuits it \nopposes. By Linda Greenhouse Contributing Opinion Writer  Pop quiz No. 1: What \ndo the following have in common: an abortion clinic in Louisiana; the county of \nEl Paso, Tex.; and two individuals who don\u2019t want to buy health insurance? \nAnswer: All are plaintiffs in federal court.  The Hope Medical Group for Women, \nin Shreveport, La., is the petitioner in the June Medical case now at the \nSupreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of Louisiana\u2019s latest effort to\n shut down the state\u2019s few remaining abortion clinics.  El Paso County is suing \nthe Trump administration to stop construction of a new section of border wall on\n its southern border with Mexico that will be paid for in part by siphoning off \nmillions of dollars that Congress intended for a project at the Fort Bliss Army \nbase, the county\u2019s biggest employer and economic engine. This case is not yet at\n the Supreme Court, but is most likely headed there.  And Neill Hurley and John \nNantz, the two men who object to being told to buy health insurance? They and a \ngroup of red states led by Texas are in the Supreme Court defending the lower \ncourts\u2019 conclusion that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, which no \nlonger carries any penalty for noncompliance, is unconstitutional.  Pop quiz No.\n 2: Which of these are the only plaintiffs that the administration\u2019s lawyers are\n not trying to throw out of court? Answer: The ones who don\u2019t like Obamacare. \nAccording to the Trump administration, doctors who perform abortion are not \nentitled to sue on behalf of their patients, even though the Supreme Court has \nupheld doctors\u2019 \u201cthird-party standing\u201d in abortion cases since 1976 on the \ntheory that it is impractical for a woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy to \nhave to bring a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a state-created \nobstacle. In the El Paso case, the administration argues, any connection between\n construction of the border wall and harm to the county is too speculative to \npermit the county to maintain its lawsuit. This is a column about standing to \nsue. It may seem an oddly dry choice of topic with a presidential impeachment \nabout to get underway and the world flying apart at an even faster pace than \nusual. But as I hope these current examples show, standing is a crucially \nimportant component of the power of the federal courts. Judges must dismiss a \nlawsuit that lacks a plaintiff with standing. In the cases I\u2019ve listed, \ncontested questions of standing are playing out in the shadows. I want to hold \nthem up to the light. The picture is not a pretty one. It could go far to \ndefining the current Supreme Court term. It\u2019s easy to lull people into assuming \nthat the question of standing embodies some kind of neutral principle, divorced \nfrom ideology. Courts have developed a three-part inquiry for deciding whether a\n plaintiff has standing, designed to ensure that a lawsuit presents the \u201ccase or\n controversy\u201d that Article III of the Constitution requires for the exercise of \nfederal court jurisdiction. Did the plaintiff suffer a real injury? Was the \ninjury caused by the defendant? And can a victory in court actually bring \nrelief? These questions appear to invite simple yes-or-no answers. But a few \nminutes\u2019 reflection shows that they are far from value-free, and finding the \nanswers requires the exercise of judgment. For example, El Paso County claims \nthat even before a dime has been diverted from Fort Bliss and spent on the wall,\n it is already suffering damage to its reputation that will cost it business \ninvestment and tourist dollars.  That\u2019s because, as the county\u2019s chief \nadministrator told the Federal District Court, the decision to build the wall at\n the county\u2019s southern border has \u201ctransmitted all over the world\u201d the message \nthat El Paso is \u201cso endangered by immigrants and closeness to Mexico that it \nneeds a wall to protect it.\u201d Another official testified that the impending wall \nwas \u201cgenerating fears of potential investors that the community will be mired in\n a long-term state of chaos that includes violent crime, the blight of \nconstruction, and impediments to crossing back and forth across the border.\u201d \nFederal District Judge David Briones agreed with the county that the \n\u201creputational and economic injuries\u201d it described were sufficient to establish \nstanding. The injuries were \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to the government\u2019s proposed \naction, he wrote in his opinion in October 2019, granting a preliminary \ninjunction to stop further wall-building preparations. Last week, a panel of the\n United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit voted 2 to 1 to grant the \nadministration\u2019s request for a stay of that injunction pending appeal. \u201cAmong \nother reasons,\u201d the majority\u2019s one-paragraph order said, there was a \n\u201csubstantial likelihood that appellees lack Article III standing.\u201d The question \nof doctors\u2019 standing presented by the June Medical case, which will be argued in\n the Supreme Court on March 4, has received far too little attention. The issue \nnever came up on the path the case took to the Supreme Court, and no wonder, \nsince doctors\u2019 right to advocate on behalf of their abortion patients has been \nclear ever since the immediate post-Roe v. Wade period. Louisiana injected the \nquestion into the case after the Hope clinic filed its appeal from a decision by\n the Fifth Circuit that upheld the state law\u2019s requirement that doctors who \nperform abortions have admitting privileges at local hospitals. While the \nclinic\u2019s Supreme Court petition was awaiting action, the state filed its own \npetition challenging the clinic\u2019s standing.  The only current justice to have \nquestioned doctors\u2019 standing is Justice Clarence Thomas, who raised the issue, \nseemingly out of nowhere, in his dissenting opinion in 2016 in Whole Woman\u2019s \nHealth v. Hellerstedt, the case in which the court struck down a Texas \nadmitting-privileges law identical to the Louisiana law the Fifth Circuit \nsubsequently upheld.  While no other justice joined the Thomas dissent, his \nopinion, largely overlooked at the time, put the standing issue in play as a new\n weapon in the anti-abortion arsenal. Early this month, Solicitor General Noel \nFrancisco filed the administration\u2019s brief in support of Louisiana, asking the \ncourt to dismiss the clinic\u2019s complaint \u201cfor lack of third-party standing\u201d or, \nin the alternative, to uphold the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision. Remarkably, the \nbrief fails to cite Singleton v. Wulff, the 1976 decision recognizing doctors\u2019 \nthird-party standing. Justice Harry Blackmun, writing for the majority in the \ncase, said that \u201cseveral obstacles\u201d deterring pregnant women from asserting \ntheir own rights justified granting an exception to the usual rule that \nprecludes plaintiffs from litigating the rights of others. \u201cThe constitutionally\n protected abortion decision is one in which the physician is intimately \ninvolved,\u201d Justice Blackmun wrote, citing his then-three-year-old opinion in Roe\n v. Wade. \u201cAside from the woman herself, therefore, the physician is uniquely \nqualified to litigate the constitutionality of the state\u2019s interference with, or\n discrimination against, that decision.\u201d The obstacles that existed in 1976 \nstill exist, say 368 lawyers and law students who have had abortions, in an \nunusual brief they filed urging the justices to preserve doctors\u2019 standing. All \nthe women signed their names and professional affiliations, with the exception \nof one anonymous law student and one anonymous \u201csenior\u201d Justice Department \nattorney.  \u201cIndeed,\u201d the brief says, \u201cthere is hardly a better way to guarantee \nthat unconstitutional laws will go unchallenged than to expect pregnant women to\n become litigants as they make this most personal and private decision, locate a\n provider, make an appointment or set of appointments as required by local law, \nraise the necessary funds to cover the procedure, and often race \u2014 perhaps out \nof state \u2014 to exercise their reproductive choice consistent with the \nlabyrinthine applicable regulations.\u201d Of the current controversies over \nstanding, the Affordable Care Act case that was recently appealed to the Supreme\n Court is the most revealing. The underlying issue is whether Congress\u2019s repeal \nof the tax imposed on people for failing to buy health insurance has effectively\n invalidated the individual mandate, which the Supreme Court in 2014 upheld only\n as an exercise of the congressional taxing power.  No tax, no mandate, the \nargument now goes. A federal district judge in Texas agreed, using that argument\n as a springboard to declare the entire law invalid. Last month, a panel of the \nFifth Circuit agreed 2 to 1 that the mandate was now invalid, but declined to \ndecide what the implications of that holding are for the remainder of the \nstatute. Because the Trump administration has refused to defend the law, its \ndefense has fallen to the House of Representatives and a coalition of blue \nstates led by California. They are seeking expedited review in the Supreme \nCourt, arguing that the huge shadow now hanging over the law threatens \ndisruption to the entire health care system and requires prompt resolution.  The\n standing of the two plaintiffs, Mr. Hurley and Mr. Nantz, was challenged in the\n Fifth Circuit and upheld by the panel\u2019s majority, which credited the assertion \nby the two men that they felt obliged to comply with the now-toothless mandate \nbecause they believed that people should obey the law.  The dissenting judge, \nCarolyn Dineen King, objected, arguing that in the absence of any penalty for \nviolating the mandate, \u201cthe individual plaintiffs will be no worse off by any \nconceivable measure if they choose not to purchase health insurance.\u201d Any injury\n from buying the unnecessary health insurance \u2014 presumably, an expense that the \nmen would not otherwise incur \u2014 \u201cis entirely self-inflicted,\u201d Judge King \ncontinued, adding that \u201ca long line of cases establishes that self-inflicted \ninjuries cannot establish standing because a self-inflicted injury, by \ndefinition, is not traceable to the challenged action.\u201d A plaintiff \u201ccannot \nmanufacture standing\u201d simply by spending money, she said. Last week, Solicitor \nGeneral Francisco filed a brief  urging the justices to stay their hand and let \nthe case continue to play out in the lower courts. The brief, referring to the \nmandate as Section 5000A, contained a surprising line. There was no need to \nrush, the solicitor general told the court: the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling \u201ccreates \nno present, real-world emergency precisely because, as all parties agree, \nSection 5000A no longer subjects any individual to any concrete consequence.\u201d No\n \u201cconcrete consequence\u201d? All agree? What about the requirement that a plaintiff \nmust have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d to sue? And yet these two individuals \nmaintain their standing to pursue a case that has once again left the Affordable\n Care Act hanging by a thread. (The standing of Texas and the other state \nplaintiffs is on equally weak ground, as Judge King made clear in her dissenting\n opinion.) As I said earlier in this column, it\u2019s not a pretty picture, but it\u2019s\n a clear one: The president\u2019s lawyers have weaponized the doctrine of standing. \nFor sure, there are more diverting legal issues to talk about. But standing is \ntoo important a subject to be left to the experts \u2014 or even to the justices. How\n the court deals with the issue in these cases and others like them will have a \nlot to tell us about who and what is left standing at the end of this Supreme \nCourt term, and the terms to come.
