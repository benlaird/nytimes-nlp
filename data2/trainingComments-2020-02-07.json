As are the decision makers and power players.  \n\nI sense a tremor that will become an earthquake in the next two decades, when the small numbers of minorities, including women, continue to tip the balance. \n\nUntil then, as audiences we can continue to seek out films based on their merits, and not on their marketing budgets. One quibble I have is the call-out that somehow JLo was robbed of a nomination (see Carlos Aguilar's Jan. 13 op-ed in this paper). \n\nJennifer Lopez is not a strong, actress, in any film she's been in.  She has a strong, charismatic presence. And her success, she owns it, she deserves it. But an Oscar performance, nah.",

The performances of the two lead actors were so nuanced and real.  And, my father, a real WASP if there ever was one, had several Don Shirley albums back in the day.  I remember him playing them regularly.  That fact added particular enjoyment of the film for me.\n\nThe Oscars are a tradition.  Some years, I agree with the selections, some years I think a movie or performer should have been nominated.  They can\u2019t nominate all the good movies or all the great performances; that\u2019s an impossible task.  Viewers watch to see their favorite stars, dish about what they\u2019re wearing, rate the acceptance speeches.  Maybe it is silliness but I have always enjoyed the once-a-year spectacle.  \n\nToday we went to see the nominated live-action short subjects so that we\u2019d be Oscar-ready.

But  I would not be so eager to claim the ISA's so \"woke.\"   Once you start pulling things apart to find them  \"problematic\" it never stops.  I'm sure there are many many ISA winners the PC police would find very objectionable.  And frankly I'd say those films are all the better for it.  Art made in the service of ideology is not art.

The Grammys are the same. I gave up on that hellish show long ago when new 'music' categories were created for what I as a musician refer to as noise, not music. I haven't watched an awards show since and rarely if ever will I go and pay $12-$18 to sit in a theatre where I have to pre-pick my seat, as if risking my life on a sub-par airline flight. \nIt seems the 'awards' industry is just that; an industry whose goal is just like our economy, to make money not art or entertainment. If the academy spent as much time picking great movies as the actresses and actors spend picking their outfits (or lack of clothing) and walking the red carpet, maybe it would be worth watching. But I doubt it. It's as political as politics and that's enough reason to stay away.",

If this had been a story about a white man, and if that actor portrayed the role as incredibly beautifully as Mr. Foxx did, he would have been nominated, and he would have won. I was also angry about the snubbing of BlackKklansman last year. It was an important film that was well-directed and well-acted. It helped me (a white women) increase my understanding of life for black people....and why black people fear many police. (And I see that in real life too.)\n\nI am also tired of Hollywood's omission and narrow view of women. LITTLE WOMEN was beautifully directed by Greta Gerwig, and it ended with a powerful statement by Jo March. I would enjoy seeing many more movies about the lives of women, both historical and modern. But I'm tired of categories women are slotted into....the fem fetal, the aggressively sexy ones, the ditzy ladies, the old women who are there only to serve the men in their lives. I want more smart interesting women in all kinds of roles.Women from all class and racial backgrounds. A lot fewer power women like WONDER WOMAN and a lot more power women like we saw in HIDDEN FIGURES.\n\nI will continue to see movies in the theater and at home, and I will appreciate the fine films and the people who make them. If any of them are honored with an Oscar I may read it in th next mornings paper.....or not.",

I am frustrated and disappointed that rather than acknowledging those cultural shifts by honoring the director of such a tour de force, the Academy saw fit to deprive Gerwig of a rightly-deserved Oscar nomination for Best Director, and, in doing so, refused to acknowledge the impact and necessity of placing woman-centered narratives on as high a pedestal as male-centric ones.",

Especially since most of the winners ride on an intense emotional outburst. As if the pondered response to  the possibility that her husband is cheating on her disqualifies it as inferior acting. I've been  impressed by actors at Juilliard and actors in outdoor Shakespeare theater companies as much as by actors on the silver screen. Do they have to win academy awards? OK. Let's say it's entertaining and fun, sort of like a game of cards and leave it go at that.

Driving Miss Daisy is not nearly as successful a movie, but again, it details an unlikely friendship between two people of different races who touch each other's lives in surprising ways.\n\nWhy these movies are so offensive to a certain sensibility I can't say.

Yet,At the time they departed the race they were polling around 2% support among African Americans.  \n\nI do agree Biden should not have entered the race - while fundamentally decent he is low energy and prone to gaffes, relative to his generational peers Sanders and Warren, both of whom come across as energetic and engaging.  Likewise, the Hunter Biden conflict of interest was an albatross waiting to land, regardless of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criminality.  Biden sucked up much of the African American support.

Our Republic has dissolved into a mass of self-interest and money.  The Executive branch has morphed into an ignorant self-serving Autocrat, surrounded by like sycophants. He has successfully neutered both the FBI and Justice.  All our laws can be ignored.  The law will be whatever the king decides at that moment. \n\nFinally, the Senate has managed to make themselves into the king's jester.

He has no experience! Obama went on to become President, for 8 years, surpassing The Clinton machine handily.  \n   People complain that Buttigieg hasn\u2019t any experience, that minorities don\u2019t like him.  It was the same with Obama.  What\u2019s his experience? But will white folks vote for him? Can he win? \n   It\u2019s the same with Sanders.  Bernie\u2019s been out on the forefront of our nations fight against climate change, healthcare, wealth inequality for his entire career, and Democrats are freaking out because their staid political machine has no vision and apparently aren\u2019t up to the modern times to realize their own foibles and that they can\u2019t compete.  I wanted Bernie last time, but the Dems put up the most divide candidate, because it was Easy. \n    I don\u2019t know who\u2019s gonna make it, but I\u2019m energized by a Bernie/Buttigieg ticket.

I, too, like Liz, and would be happy if she got the nomination, but I like Bernie more, and among the reasons is that he's authentic and has always delivered the same message: the system is broken and needs to be changed to work for the average American. No one can question his credentials. The worst they can do is call him a \"socialist\" and that pejorative has lost a lot of its power.\n\nAt least you acknowledge what we Sanders supporters have known since 2016: the DNC and the Establishment are willing to do anything - including using a \"quality assurance\" app that could be manipulated to deny Bernie delegates. Why else would they contract with a former operative from Hilary's campaign two months before the caucus, \"coincidentally\" as Sanders rose to the top of the polls, to produce this app?

As someone from the Rust Belt who also works in Urban Development, I watched in disbelief as stories that went against the basic reality of what we deal with here went viral. E.G. his \"1000 Homes in 1000 Days\" program was spun not as someone keeping a campaign promise to remove asbestos ridden dangerously rotted homes from neighborhoods suffering over time from massive population loss, but rather as a program he launched to gentrify South Bend and kick marginalized people out of their homes. Using data and technology to upgrade local government and develop SMART streets, services and infrastructure wasn't seen as much of an accomplishment, but our sister city is Flint, MI & all of our services here in Pontiac were outsourced to our County.  As an advocate for some of the things he was able to accomplish, I found what he did inspiring. I imagine that members of the majority black city I live in might have found these deeds more interesting as well, if they didn't hear on repeat from mainstream media how black people don't like him....He has 75% non-white support in South Bend &  there are a number of his supporters expressing deep upset at the exclusion of their voices to support this narrative - as was expressed by Gladys Muhammed who introduced him before his Iowa speech.",

Ideological purity versus megalomaniacal cult figure with a motley assortment of coattails.\n\nSen. Bill Bradley once used a pyramid analogy to explain differences between republicans and democrats. Republicans, he said, had all the support of industry, corporate America, the wealthy tax-averse, and religious right (we can add white supremacists now). They formed a  stable base for financing elections, and the candidate sitting at the top was less important than the base supporting him (yes, always him). Democrats' pyramid is inverted. The national party is wildly out of touch, they don't march in lockstep like the republicans, who likely admire Trump's ability to weed out diverse voices. And so everything hinges on the candidate, who is at the top of the pyramid, but a pyramid that has been inverted. So the candidate is carrying all the weight of all these groups that can't seem to compromise or agree on some consensus that simply winning the election is better than remaining 'pure' and getting trounced.\n\nWe've been seeing this for a long time. Media outlets are so much more corporate and commercially driven than they once were, the financial pressures mean any voices outside of a narrow corporate mainstream ideology, where capitalism is simply the natural order of things, will get frogmarched out of the narrative faster than Lt.

Moreover, the former NY City Mayor, seems not so well versed in foreign politics.\n\nNow the good news: it for certain that the acquainted Potus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as Herod did 2020 years ago - will now send his battle-hardened  army to search and undo on the spot any new born (political) messiah. \n\nWell, all we know that he failed.",

She feels safer at the center of the herd. Yet giving into that fear has steadily eased the herd to the right. In 2016 the Republican base stampeded, and the GOP intelligentsia had no choice but to yield to democracy within their party. Now some of those same intelligent people, along with Goldberg, fear that democracy will lose the election for Democrats. The irony is complete. We have no moral option but to be faithful and fearless, recalling the words of the hymn playing in Senator Romney's head as he cast his recent vote: \"Do what is right, let the consequence follow...God will protect you in doing what's right.\"",

Though I supported the last President, this is where he, too, failed to make much of a mark beyond a campaign slogan.",

The stink on Trump - noxious as it was - was more tolerable to swing voters than the stink on other GOP wannabes or ultimately on Hilary Clinton. That anti-establishment electoral block was denied a choice between Trump and the other anti-establishment candidate Sanders by the intervention of the party executive. If once again through insider manipulation the electorate is denied that choice, then of course Trump is guaranteed a second term. \n\nWhen Biden's campaign collapses for lack of spark, the Clintonites will look to Buttigieg to pick up the banner for the dominant moderate wing. A fresh face minority with underdog appeal, Buttigieg is acceptable to the wealthy and powerful who count themselves as Democrats; and unfortunately that's the rub. \n\nSanders, who relies on donations from the little guy and rejects all offers from the one-percenters, correctly points out that Buttigieg would be incapable of bringing fundamental reform to a system held hostage by the rich. He is already beholding to them.\n\nIndeed it is rare in the modern political era - given the enormous financial ante required of prospective candidates to compete - that such a direct, honest, humble, determined and yes even inspiring challenger comes along who is not already in someone's pocket. Sanders vs Trump would be the ultimate test of good vs evil.",

In European parliamentary democracies we would see the Democrats and the Sanders Party haggling over details of policy and the distribution of ministerial seats to determine whether they could run as a coalition. Instead, Sanders has decided to attempt to take over the Democratic Party from within and turn it into a mirror of the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nThe unfortunate fact exists that the neither section of the American Left (the Democratic Party or the Sanders Party) has enough numerical clout to win the presidency on its own.

Democratic Establishment were siphoning Sanders' votes to other candidates to make sure he doesn't have the highest number of delegates and win the delegates along with the popular vote. They intentionally do the drip drip release of the results by intentionally reporting counties that Buttigieg wins before reporting the the ones that Bernie wins. The whole strategy is to keep Buttigieg in the lead for many days so that he can raise money by falsely claiming to be the winner; even though they obviously know that Bernie Sanders will win both the delegates and popular votes whenever the correct total results are reported. Why are they doing this? It's reported by numerous media outlets that Buttigieg is a business partner of the App developer for Iowa democratic party and a friend of the Party chairman in Iowa . That's why Buttigieg was able to know immediately after the caucus on Monday that he's leading with 77 percent of the votes but also refused to mention that he's second if proper reporting and tabulation of the correct results are done as demanded by the Associated Press.

Now, my only goal is to turn Trump out of office.  while I like many of the Democratic front runners, I do not think they can develop the campaign organization that is needed, right now, to defeat Trump.  We need a candidate who has the smarts, experience and unlimited resources to building a top-notch far reaching campaign, once that can ward off Russian trolls through targeted and wide media operations.  That person is Michael Bloomberg.  I would not have, a few months ago, given him any thought, but I think he is the only one who can building the campaign needed.  He doesn't have to spend time running around to fund raisers as do the other candidates.  I see this as a positive for this election.   I hope others who are against him will give another look at what he brings to the campaign, and not harp on his flaws.  They all have flaws, but Trump must be defeated.",

Money will still rule all; the disenfranchised will struggle. Only real change in economic policy will capture the attention and hearts of those who aren't avid readers of the Times and Washington Post (AKA Fox students) What Sanders and Warren are arguing for is a dramatic change in the way our government supports society.  With our system, a moderate will not effect that kind of change.  We truly need to try, just once, supporting a full throated attempt at helping those who are not thriving . Id guess that 1/3rd to 40% of Americans have major struggles due to our economic and healthcare system.

He is also likely to give a hard time to those who nowadays call themselves journalists. His name is Pete Buttigieg and, yes, he will win in New Hampshire too.

Incidentally, labelling us as uncompromising purists is presumptuous and refutes the fact that only 10% of his supporters didn't vote Democrat last time, so enough! Bernie works for economic reform in the way FDR did, but most importantly he has the strongest environmental platform AND while not an isolationist, he favors smart diplomacy over the stupid, endless wars we've engaged in. He's smart, he'll choose smart people to work with him and they will flock in much the same way people did to JFK. They already are. We're on the brink here and we don't need gradual, we need big!

It will be interesting to see if reflexive Bernie haters on the left are able to overcome their dislike of Bernie when the general election comes around and he has (possibly) won the right to challenge Trump.\n\nBernie Bros did not cost Hillary the election. This is a unique moment in American history and it seems more necessary to fight fire with fire when confronting this challenge with Trump and I find it beneficial to have a leader a little more enlightened to counter the Trump movement's quest for reelection.

This is war.\" And if you and the rest of the editorial board do not understand that THIS IS WAR, then please go do something else with your time, because YES it IS Bernie or bust! It is time for the best ideas to win. It is time to back a person with a sweeping policy agenda, the likes of which have not been seen since the New Deal, and which similarly aims to correct the mounting ills that unfettered capitalism has not, will not, and cannot correct. The reason Trump was elected was dissatisfaction with the status quo on both sides: He electrified his base, and the DNC moderate choice failed to electrify her base. The people at the bottom are tired of broken promises. Bernie is the only candidate who has been preaching this gospel for decades. We were just too scared to listen before. Warren is fine.

To make matters worse, some of the Democratic candidates (principally Sanders) have indecently taken up those untruths. I believe all of the candidates must pledge to protect Biden from that, whether or not it looks like Biden will be the nominee. They should all also join a lawsuit to prevent the White House from continuing to do this. Also: The number of Iowa caucus goers dropped by one third. What explains that? Has everybody in Iowa joined the Trump cult? Are Democrats fatally disheartened? Are the candidates actually not that exciting including Sanders? The caucus format is biased in favor of him.

There was talk of engineering a contested convention, but how it would be suicidal to force someone else on the party if Trump won a plurality of votes. Everyone, on both sides, believed he was a doomed candidate because the Republican moderates would sit out the election rather than vote for Trump. Of course, they didn\u2019t. He energized the base and the supposed moderates rationalized voting for him anyway because they despised the other candidate so much. It was a winning formula. Sound familiar? \n\nBernie energizes the base and encapsulates the values of the party. We need to stop worrying about whether he pleases the center. Trump proved in 2016 that an election can be won without spending one second campaigning toward the center, which in many ways doesn\u2019t even exist anymore. People have already decided whether they\u2019re voting for a blue or red ticket in November.\n\nThis is coming from someone who voted for Hillary in 2016, because I thought she was the \u201csafer\u201d choice. I also had high hopes for Harris last year and donated to her camp. But here we are. Let\u2019s not make the same mistakes we made in 2016.

What scares them more than Trump is whether they'll once again get caught fixing the primaries in favor of their chosen Neoliberal. What terrifies them is that, absent their meddling, they might have to do what they've demanded from the rest of us for decades. THEY, not us, might have to suck it up and get behind whoever wins the nomination. And all of us who are sick and tired of business-as-usual are waiting to see if they can.",

They address the fact of the 6,000 lies Trump has told thus far in only 3 years, appoint a spokesperson of great charm, recognition and sophistication to attack Trump daily and respond to his attacks with withering counter attack. \nThe media will be all over it. Every day Trump gets hit back, right in the face, hard. He gets back much more than he spews out, all the way to the election.\nYou don't bring a knife to a gun fight.

The issues are very different, as are the candidates\u2019 ages, but other fundamentals of both candidacies are chillingly familiar. The youth vote is at the back of both the historical McGovern and theoretical Sanders candidacies; we even have 2020\u2019s version of Tricky Dick Nixon in The Donald, right down to the core criminality of both candidates and the rapturous indulgences both candidates receive from their surrounding cult of faithful acolytes. All that would be needed to complete this nightmare comparison would be some version of Thomas Eagleton in Bernie\u2019s initial choice of VP running mate. \n\nBernie will get sliced, diced, and shredded by Trump\u2019s GOP messaging and branding machine in the general election. Though we are too bipolar a society to replicate the 49-1 split in the Electoral College of 1972, a Trump-Sanders general election this year would would show an equivalent margin of difference in favor of the darkness that surrounds Trump\u2019s candidacy. As hard as it would be for to swallow voting for a Democrat-come-lately Republican like Michael Bloomberg, he may be lighting the only path leading out of this evolving tragedy come November.",

Democrats have two strategies to counter the reality of the Trump economy: they can paint an apocalyptic vision of the future or they can paint an apocalyptic vision of the present. Trump will destroy democracy or Trump has already destroyed democracy. The first requires Democrats to convince the American people that the end is near (in this case, for the booming economy) and that their solution is to scrap capitalism for socialism, an economic system that is more associated with failed states like Venezuela and the Soviet Union. That is a tough sell!  The second requires convincing Americans that Trump has already corrupted the institutions of democracy and that we need to stop him at all costs. The problem for Democrats here is that almost half of the American electorate is pro-life, pro-religion, loves America and it\u2019s history, think our borders should be protected, and think Trump has done a good job (49% approval rating). Also, all investigations to prove that Trump is corrupt or has committed an impeachable crime has failed. Here, for them to succeed, they need a candidate that is a paragon of virtue; so far no candidate fits that bill. The only real hope left for Democrats is for Nancy Pelosi to pray for rain!",

Remember when Trump was running in 2016? The RNC ran 16 candidates against him. Why? To break up his support and to confuse and water down his message and campaign. It's the exact strategy the DNC is applying to Bernie. \n\nNow if weak establishment candidates like Biden and Klobuchar and Warren were not running, Bernie would have consolidated some of their supporters and would be way out front. This is the critical piece of information Goldberg Omits to confuse and mystify her readers. \n\nGoldberg is at least honest in disclosing her husband's consulting for the Warren campaign. But that actually supports the fact that she is deeply invested in the Democratic establishment and that her husband's fortunes are tied to one particular candidate (Warren), who is endorsed by the DNC Times editorial board. An editorial board that runs hit piece after hit piece against Sanders to stop him from winning and becoming the progressive leader of the Democratic Party and establishment.\n\nSo to conclude, dear reader, Goldberg is in fact sowing untruths and chaos and confusion amongst her readers against Sanders.",

The people who matter are the working class voters in midwestern \"swing\" states: when they all, regardless of color, realize on which side of the political bread their butter lies, the Democrats will win. The real problem with Bernie voters is that they are not Democrtic voters, like the first flush of youthful voters for Obama.

A single-payer health care system may be a commendable goal, but I suspect most people don't feel comfortable throwing out the existing system of Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance overnight.\n\nThe DNC and Democrat candidates must focus on health care for all - not health insurance, with its unaffordable co-pays, deductibles and numerous other problems.  It must focus on climate change, which we see daily, even here in Southern California.  Third, but not last or least, they need to be pushing for reforms in Washington, many of which may require amendments to the Constitution.",

Any Democratic president will be able to stop the worst crimes against humanity that are being committed by the current regime. No Democratic president will be able to effect radical improvement, but even putting an end to the pervasive, abnormal corruption will be worth it. \n\nA good, well-intentioned president cannot wave a wand and create radical change as long as the filibuster remains in place. However, it would be possible to do a lot, and any Democratic president could put us on a much better path. \n\nFrom the start, this has been my thinking, and while each candidate has very real weaknesses, any of them would gather intelligent, competent staff and work hard to re-enter the circle of civilized nations.

Moderate Democrats won't allow him to push his agenda too far to the left. \n\nI see his policies as an aggressive starting point in a negotiation with Congress, which could lead to some very progressive policies that the majority of Americans are in favor of today. \n\nMedicare for All? Maybe not. But a strong push from the left could lead to a more secure Affordable Care Act and lower prescription drug prices.\n\nForgiving Student Debt?  Probably not. But forcing our elected officials to deal with out of control college tuition costs and punishing predatory lenders seems reasonable.\n\nYou get the point. Starting from the center is a terrible way to begin a negotiation. Democrats have been doing that for far too long.",

If the young don't think he is too old to run, why should anyone else.\n\n2) Bernie has openly called himself a \"Democratic Socialist\" for years yet has run strongly in his first campaign for president and is making a very strong showing in his second. In past decades a person who labeled himself a Democratic Socialist would have had the half life of a snowball in you know where.\n\n3) While the economy made be doing well, it is doing well primarily for corporations and large stock owners, not the average working person. Any tiny wage gains the average person gets (if any at all) are more than siphoned off by the increased costs of health care, education and the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n4) The current state of Republicans has shown that there is NO inclination to work with ANY democrat, be they moderate or otherwise.

            "comment_body": "Bernie Sanders sweeps the popular vote in Iowa (6,000-10,000 by some estimates) and his win is even questioned? Granted, some would say that it comes down to the very arcane delegate apportioning system Iowa uses. A bizarre system where in one precinct Sanders gets 111 votes and Buttigieg 47 yet each is award 2 delegates apiece. In what democracy is that valid or fair? The same people who roll out the argument that Hillary won the popular vote by 3 million votes are all of a sudden twisting themselves into logical knots to explain Buttigieg's tie in delegates with Sanders as a \"win.\" Uh? We all know what the DNC did in 2016 when it rigged the primary. Now, we have a very suspicious app rolled out, untested, by a shadow company literally called Shadow, staffed by ex-Hillary officials and supported by a nearly $50,0000 donation from the Buttigieg campaign. Just look at the bizarre and inexplicable results from Black Hawk County. The supervisor posts the results on his Facebook page to get the results out because the app doesn't work and the phone lines are jammed. The state somehow posts ITS results from Black Hawk showing Duval Patrick getting 7% of the vote (most of it taken from Sander's vote total). The ACTUAL number of votes Patrick received? ZERO. When the supervisor told the state Dems he had already posted the correct results and asked where did they get their results, the state officials said they made an error. This app needs to be forensically examined by the FBI.",

FDR's these people are not!\n\nI think we're due for major changes in both parties -- and maybe for the first time in over 100 -- new approaches to ideas rejected before as outside the mainstream. \n\nI'm less worried about Bernie Sanders than many others. I think despite the roiling concern about democratic socialism, Sanders is radical, mainstream, and conservative all rolled into one package. \n\nWhether that's what media figures want or not, I think Sanders as an independent has done more to show the Democratic party where it went wrong and where it should go in the future than anyone else seeking the nomination. \n\nThat's not to say he's too old, which I believe he is, but maybe, just maybe, his ideas will spur a new party.",

The Republican Party is very organized, militant, united and disciplined. They are only one single group of white people who are 72% of population.On the other hand, the Democratic is deeply divided into extreme left, center left and mix of all ethnic groups including white. They have too many litmus test. Finally, extreme left and socialist can not beat Trump.",

In short, he looks \"strong\" even though he is actually weak.

Maybe it's because - and I am biased here - Dems more often look for someone they admire, with empathy and intelligence, and the GOP look for someone to have a beer with, someone who reminds them of them. In a word: Democrats expect more from their candidates. However if we need to pull votes from the other side, gaffes and rambles might humanize a candidate who otherwise looks too polished. The difference though is Trump is completely comfortable and confident in his inanity, whereas Biden at least recognizes something is getting lost in translation.

            "comment_body": "Why so much establishment anxiety surrounding Bernie Sanders ? It seems to me that the concern around the ambiguous and uncertain meaning of electability is really just a cloak that masks fear of the undoing and rollback of neoliberal corporatism which has characterized the Democratic party over the last 40 years and the loss of power and influence for those that currently enjoy it that engenders. Why would a liberal, progressive party fear universal healthcare, gun control, improved public infrastructure and education, fairer criminal justice policy, improved housing affordability, facing climate change, and a more rational, just and less expensive foreign policy? The system works best when people support and fight for the values and polices that they believe in rather than vote based on some strategic idea coming from a throughly conflicted group of establishment pundits all supported by corporate money. The thing about Bernie is that its his ideas and not his personality that have traction. I cannot understand how the establishment can look at the overwhelming support Bernie has from those under 40 and not ask themselves what it is they don't understand or appreciate about modern life that the young do. Stop worrying about elections and horse races and how pearl clutching suburban women will vote and start channeling your energy and passions into change.",

This is a real threat to their cosy little fiefdom. Just like the venal senators who voted to acquit Trump, they will move heaven and earth to keep their toehold on the pedestal of power.\n\nSanders would not be my first choice, but I have spoken to others who think he absolutely should be the nominee and are further convinced that he can win.\n\nMy problem is the entire field of Democratic candidates, except Bernie, is so underwhelming. No spark, no vitality. \nI wouldn't follow them to a yard sale! Trump is a preening dolt, but he projects vigor and certitude, even if he is wearing a truss, popping Adderall and an inveterate liar.\n\nThe president has so dominated the news cycle since his escalator ride down from his Trump Tower eyrie in 2015, that the election is going to be solely on his personality. Nothing else matters. People either vote to keep him or dump him. All else is irrelevant.\n\nIf Bernie wins the nomination he should pick Kamala Harris as his running mate. She was the only one other than Bernie who showed some independence of spirit and personality. Let's go all in!",

Given the similarities between the two campaign platforms, and given the urgent needs of millions of Americans who are not actually doing all that well (look at the most recent report from the UN rapporteur on poverty in America), I would think a Warren supporter would be disappointed by the results of the Iowa caucuses, and worried about Warren\u00b4s chances going forward.  But not terrified to see Sanders (as opposed to Biden) leading at this point.\n\nI haven\u00b4t seen poll results on this so I can only speak for myself, to say that as a Sanders supporter, I would not be terrified if Warren were on track to win the nomination.  Disappointed, yes, determined to keep pushing for M4A and serious action on climate change and corruption but not terrified.  \n\nWe all need to focus on the issues, and celebrate that young people and the poor have a candidate who excites them and consistently fights on their behalf.  Sanders\u00b4 campaign is as American as it gets.  If those who call themselves pragmatic centrists really want to win, why don\u00b4t they fight for what over 60% of Americans want -- single payer health care?  Stop worrying about the health insurance industry, stop sending them our tax dollars, admit that while many were helped by the ACA, far too many are still suffering and dying -- be pragmatic, not \"my way or the highway\", as they accuse Bernie of being!",

Democrats' proposed adjustments  are viewed as a potential threat to incomes and jobs to many who have found jobs in recent years, as they see the many policy changes proposed by Democrats likely causing economic disruptions affecting their jobs/income, at least on a temporary basis, or in some cases for much longer. In their mind this is the most immediate concern, far outweighing healthcare, income disparity, education, climate change and social injustices. And don't forget that Trump has \"answers\" to all these issues, mostly lies, if you will, and focus on weaning concerns from the electorate on these issues. Just recently he allowed for maintaining coverage for  preexisting conditions, and maternal leave, as well as supporting trade schools and, of course, even lower taxes for the middle class. He will promise anything that will attract voters and his megaphone will be unprecedented. He will use it to disparage his Democratic opponent, and will be particularly effective with those who are most progressive, as he will likely succeed to mark them with the social/communist label.

I still believe Trump will win again, not the least because the Democratic base can't get together and won't on election day either.  That isn't pessimism - although there's nothing wrong with pessimism - it's just realism.  I do hope this much focus and intensity is maintained for the mid-terms, where it currently matters more.  \n\nThe negative stridency of this particular opinion piece doesn't help the situation.  Has it occurred to Ms. Cottle that too many people simply didn't like Harris or Booker? Heaven knows enough people came out and said so.  But go ahead and blame Biden for his \"biography\" and name recognition when they have none to speak of.  This is pure sour grapes whining.\n\nAndrew Yang still receives little to no media coverage even as he managed to keep maintaining eligibility for every debate, unlike Harris and Booker.  It's the way of the DNC, and of media whose owners have their own agendas.  Put the blame where it lies, not on someone's deserved name recognition.\n\nI have, for many years, greatly admired Elizabeth Warren, but not for President.  Vice President, in a heartbeat, ideally with Bloomberg.  Or Yang VP, with Bloomberg.  He's the only one focusing on what AI is bringing and soon, which most people seem to be incredibly ignorant of, and which will impact our lives much, MUCH more than even Trump has.",

At best, the Dems won the presidency a few times, while the GOP controlled Congress and the Courts. \n\nTrump hasn't really changed Reagan's message.

Trump has stripped it naked and added a dose of nastiness to increase its prurience. \n\nThe Democrats meanwhile have gone along trying to win votes by offering nothing more than watered down Reaganism.

Rather than viewing politics as a competition for scarce resources that invites conflict, Socialism eliminates conflict by letting the elite (e.g. the Communist Party, or other enlightened leaders not governed by greed) plan an economy that doesn't rely upon personal property, competition, and markets to function.\n\nBernie's vision dispenses with the Democrat Party worldview.  Instead of cobbling together a coalition based upon parasitism, it envisions reshaping the entire economy so that no one feels like a parasite.  Oppression will disappear because the oppressors will lose their power based in private property and market competition.",

This, I find, quite revealing. Trump, for nearly four years, has invariably invoked, successfully,  the same logically worthless, diversionary tactic. Why did so many Sanders primary supporters vote for either Trump, or a third party candidate in the 2016 election? To  those who have political charisma, cogent, reasoned argument is dispensable. But political passion without the exercise of prudence and responsibility over the consequences of ones decisions makes one easy prey for demagogues.  Sanders' campaign literature stokes the \"Bernie or Bust\" theme of his most ardent supporters: Sanders' literature makes  crystal clear that he is conducting a two front war against both Trump and the Democratic party establishment!",

Both are champions of a wealth tax, Medicare for All, and a Green New Deal. The only difference between them is that Warren's candidacy is built on technocratic sophistication - undoubtedly a great sign for the health of our democracy but unlikely to rally the electorate at large.

Health insurance will become easier to obtain under the ACA, we will not have a national health insurance program. Not in four years, anyway. Free college tuition is also unlikely since Congress will not like the additional debt it would entail. And taxes? Sure he will stump for increased taxes to pay for social programs and infrastructure fixes but it is simply likely the Trump tax cuts will be reversed and minimally more pressure put on the middle class. As for international relations, I assume he would try to patch things up with Iran and NATO and work seriously with China, particularly in the aftermath of the coronavirus disaster there.\n\nThe bottom line, a Sanders administration would create slightly more moderate change than Obama's, at most.

The Republicans could not have a worse candidate, a white supremacist authoritarian who only represents the extreme right wing, so no matter who the Democrats choose it should be competitive. The Democratic Party just needs to put aside it differences for a few months. It also needs to win the Senate. It is very clear that democracy can't function with a Republican authoritarian president and a Republican controlled Senate. I don't think Sanders will win because he is too weak with black voters and white professionals in metropolitan areas. Every candidate has major weaknesses but somebody has to win, perhaps it could be someone who is not now a candidate but is elected in a brokered convention. If there is a brokered convention the votes of the super delegates after the first round could be critical.",

So, now that the 2020 election is closing in, the American voters have to be more discerning. A major section of America today suffers from the same problems that Nepal suffers from: poverty, massive inequality, appropriation of resources by a small creamy segment of society, increasingly inaccessible services and so on.

Many were frustrated at their inability to curtail the war even though the Democrats controlled the federal government. \n\nDissident Democrats began looking for someone to challenge the re-election of President Lyndon B. Johnson in the Spring primaries. \n\nMany considered it, but the only high ranking Democrat willing to step forward was Senator Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota. \n\n[...]\n\nIn 1968, winning the primaries did not necessarily win delegate votes at the national convention. \n\nThe delegate selection process was often quite separate from the popular vote, and usually controlled by the state party. \n\nConsequently, McCarthy only received 23 percent of the 2622 votes at the convention in August. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a former Senator from Minnesota who replaced LBJ as the candidate of the party establishment, got the nomination on the first ballot with 67 percent. \n\nTorn by dissent, the Democrats lost the Presidency in November by a razor thin margin. \n\nThis election prompted the Democrats to reform the nomination process...and required that African-Americans, women and youth be better represented at the convention. \n\nThe nature of the nominating process was never the same again.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jofreeman.com/photos/McCarthy.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.jofreeman.com/photos/McCarthy.html</a>",

This time around, I would really like to see a Bloomberg-Sanders or a Sanders-Bloomberg ticket, which is not as counter-intuitive as it sounds. Let\u2019s not hold Bloomberg\u2019s wealth against him. He is a self-made billionaire with a net worth 50 times that of the fraudster Trump. He has taken strong positions on fixing healthcare, reducing inequality, addressing global warming, rolling back the ongoing assault on the environment, and ending gun violence. These are all positions that should appeal to Bernie voters if they get rid of their ideological blinders. Sanders too takes all these positions, which I like, but has a skimpy record of real accomplishments. Sanders's real strength is his ability to passionately vocalize these issues and rev up the young voters. He may even be able to get some of the white rural voters to switch from Trump. Heck, if Lincoln could run on a National Union ticket with Andrew Johnson, I am sure Sanders and Bloomberg can tolerate each other and work together!",

If he becomes the nominee there will have to be an enormous effort by all Democrats to convince those who fear his Presidency that there is no reason to panic. The country cannot afford 4 more years of Trump with a supine Republican Senate. No Democratic President will have the same grip on a Democratic Congress. Radical programs will not be enacted and Sanders will have to compromise if he is serious about getting anything done during his 4 years. My take on him is that he will accomplish less than other candidates if he insists on legislation that is opposed by most Americans. There are a couple of issues that Democrats must remind voters of: \nClimate change, Trump's policies are guaranteeing that future generations will be faced with horrendous choices. \nMore judges in the Supreme court like Kavanaugh which will make the court the biggest obstacle to any progressive legislation.\nHealth care: Trump will continue to demolish ACA one step at a time.\nEnvironment: Air and water quality will go back to what it was in the 60's.\nWealth inequality: the tax \"reform\" ensures it will continue to grow.\n\nNone of the above are going to be made worse by Sanders and a Democratic Congress.",

We all need to take a few steps back and a few deep breaths.  The last Democratic caucus I attended in Colorado in 2016 was absolute mayhem.  I remember someone screaming \"Sanders voters come to this side of the gym so we can get a head count,\" but people were still milling around, and it was so noisy that not everyone could hear the call, and no one was quite sure who was in charge, much less who the precinct committee person was.  No one in attendance really had any confidence that the votes were counted with any kind of accuracy.   My point is that caucuses are and have always been a mess.  The introduction of a paper trail and a new, malfunctioning app in Iowa just served to highlight that fact.  We shouldn't do caucuses anymore, period.  But how did we get from that point A to the point B where the entire Democratic party is in complete disarray.  The only real consequence of the Iowa \"debacle\" is that people had to wait a long time for vote tallies to come in and a few tempers flared.  \n\nJust chill.

So, there was plenty of opportunity for others to displace him.  It's just not what the voters wanted.  Besides, who was to say in advance which of the septuagenarians would falter? And what if Joe had polled in Iowa what Warren did?  Would you still be saying the same thing?\n\nFinally, you pundits are too dismissive of Pete.  Sure, he's a long shot. But he just matched Bernie in a state where Bernie  outspent the field and now it's a dead heat in NH.  Your one substantive point, Pete's low polling with Black voters is right, but no one says this about Warren or Sanders who typically get a 10-15% share of Black voters.

I am unconvinced that that he could win in November \u2013and that is NOT an acceptable prospect.\n\nI continue to be impressed by Buttigieg, who would present other electability issues, granted, but please let's not so frivolously dismiss this guy as a \"novelty candidate.\" Whatever his flaws --his age, lack of experience at the federal level, less than exciting game plan --he's certainly proven he has an impressive command of the issues (domestic and international) any president will have to address, and I would trust him to bring in some of the best and brightest as cabinet and support team. I guess that sums it up --I'd trust him. Let's not be too quick to wave him off.",

Yet there exists another existential threat to America...true believers. True believers are dangerous for their blind uncompromising loyalty. They are devoted by feelings and belief to a person or a cause - for them, there exists no alternative. From the far right to the center right, blind uncompromising loyalty to Trump has brought us to the precipice of republican (both little \"r\" and big \"R\") suicide. There has been such a short, steep slope to the full exposure of Republican depravity that \"precipice of peril\" describes our times. On the far left, Bernie's Bro's constitute true believers just as dangerous as Trump's MAGAts. For them the November election is Bernie's way or the highway, which is the off-ramp they will take if Bernie is not the nominee. And where will that get us? The short answer is, the reelection of Trump and the likely take back of the House by Republicans. Suburban voters reject Bernie's vision of radical social upheaval. Not because his vision is undesirable, but because he rejects a gradual transition in favor of an upheaval which frightens the center. Suburban voters will likely sit out the election.

The fact is that Bernie's \"socialism\" is actually embraced by the majority of Americans who want free college, loan forgiveness, and medicare for all (with some caution about what would happen to their own plans when they go away, which Sanders needs to address if he's the nominee).  If you look solely at the numbers of individual donoars and money raised, Sanders is simply more popular among Democrats than anyone else running--by far.  So perhaps we should try to encourage him and explore his candidacy with the respect it deserves, and reserve criticism for his policies and messaging about them so that he can learn from those criticisms.

With trillions of dollars, we tried to help the Vietnamese; let's help Americans, too.\n\nThat was 1972. Now, Obamacare was a major step in the right direction, but we need Medicare For All. Half-measures kill people in this realm.\n\nWhich is why Bernie -- Mr. Medicare For All -- has my support. He was the first and most persistent fighter for this national need. Liz is literally on-again, off-again; Biden is Republican Lite; Mayor Pete is simply not on-board.\n\nOnly Bernie shares my nearly 50-year goal of healthcare for kids, the poor, the elderly, and the working classes. Rich folks can take care of themselves.\n\nAs Rima Regas wrote yesterday, centrism boils down to do-nothingism, where we've been on this issue at least since 1972. So if Mr. Medicare For All is not elected, it will be a bust for the needy, those who are suffering and dying for lack of healthcare.\n\n[steps off soapbox]",

I don't know why winning the White House isn't the number one goal, especially this year, but unseating Trump seems to be a secondary aim, not the primary one. Fighting among themselves occupies a lot of time and attention that could be directed at planning and strategy for the fight ahead. I will vote for whichever candidate turns out to win the primary, but I'm not confident that Democrats can win. The Republican Machine is a formidable opponent, and with the Democrats so scattered and unfocused, beating it seems an impossibility right now. Plus, so many Democrats are pledging to vote Trump if their particular favorite doesn't emerge as the candidate that I fear Trump may get almost as many Democratic votes as he does Republican ones. Maybe I'm too pessimistic, but right now I don't think things look good. I will hate for Democrats to help Trump win another term, but unless they can pull together I fear that is what will happen.",

Win the Senate and we can rewrite the rules of impeachment to put Trump on trial again, if he wins.  \n\nIf there is a second term, Trump is not likely to have the support he has now.  He will not be eligible to run again, which will in large part break some of the stranglehold he has over the party given they will not need the financial support he controls until the next election.  By then his legacy may be viewed even less favorably, especially if the truth he's obstructed gets out.  \n\nWeakened support combined with the opportunity for the truth to see the light of day may be all it takes to rid us of the Trump menace.  \n\nBesides, I am not optimistic about any Democrats chances to beat Trump.  I believe there is already foul play at work in getting Bernie in the lead.  The disruption of the Iowa caucuses is disturbing and it's been reported that Trump supporters called the reporting number, interfering with the count.  And the increase in fund raising to Sanders is also suspicious given his lack of popularity with the business class.  It's clear that Trump wants Bernie to be his opponent, so he can tar him as a Socialist (possibly even Communist...). I don't discount for one second the GOP's ability for dirty tricks.  We need a sound back up strategy.  Taking the Senate would be just that.",

Right wing Democrats are as frightened as the billionaires who support them that the cushy days of their political power and privilege will take a major hit if Sanders or Warren become President.

I lived in a car when I was (honorably) discharged, and then in the back half of a garage while I worked my way through college.  I had no health insurance because I couldn't afford it.\n\n2) NPR recently reported that the fastest rising proportion of homeless is school-aged children.  Perhaps Goldbert might ask their parents if personal economic satisfaction is at an all-time high? \n\n3) The last housing study done by Sandoval County on Rio Rancho, New Mexico (where I was assistant county attorney until I quit in disgust), revealed a lack of apartments and other low-cost housing.  Home Depot, Lowes, and Wamart--some of the biggest local employers--are firing minimum-wage cashiers to herd customers into self-checkouts.  Has Goldberg ever asked a middle-aged cashier about her personal economic satisfaction?\n\nBernie will win the primary and beat Trump because most Americans are hurting and he is a real populist, not a snake oil salesman.

That's the implication of his remarks.\n\nMy impression is that Sanders and Bloomberg are quite close on climate change.  Could they help unite voters on a common program for a new President?

Trump, McConnell and Murdoch are taking us there. Trump has no ones interest in mind except his own. The republicans view trump as a means to an end. For myself the only real chance for the democrats will be a brokered convention and nominate Bloomberg. Otherwise barring some miracle at the polls, trump and the Republican stooge machine has a good chance at another 4 years of taking us closer towards civil war.\n\nThe lessons of Germany and the holocaust need to be kept forever in everyone\u2019s mind.

The Iowa Caucus is simply a system that provides a type of instant \"run-off\". \n\nIndeed, if the USA adopted some form of run-off and/or ranked-voting system for federal elections, the country would be a much different (and arguably much better) place today with a broad Democrat majority in both houses of Congress and a Democrat president.

Is the ideological divide between moderates and the Bernie Bros so great that voters will avoid going to the polls if it's not their person? After the chaos and vehemence and division sown by Trump, a \"revolution\" as Bernie calls it may be just too much to bear for much of the country.  We should be aware that a number of former Trump voters are thinking of supporting Sanders...but also a number of Trump supporters are voting for him in the primaries as they see him as easy for Trump to beat.  That should send up some flashing red lights both for and against a Sanders nomination.  Warren is a very smart candidate, but I can predict that some of her \"plans\" as well as Bernies are unworkable and unpassable in this political polarized climate.  Biden is losing steam--even though I think he would be fine in office, getting him there is proving difficult....Pete - were it not for his youth and relative inexperience - is saying all the right things and has that soothing/calming effect-can he beat Trump?  Amy K - strikes all the right notes, but is not getting traction VP possibility.  That leaves Bloomberg looming over the campaign with billions to combat Trump - he could conceivably bridge the divide and conquer.",

So many are cobbling together a living from gigs that do not provide stability, health insurance, or a living wage, and many are burdened by debt in the tens of thousands that they were encouraged by their parents, their colleges, and the banks to take on. They don't see a future where they can buy homes, have families, build lives and community. We've heard so much about the \"economic anxiety\" of the white working class that saw Trump as their savior, and yet we ridicule an entire generation - of all races, but especially black and latino youth - who are just looking for a way to build a life.

Blue collar workers (steel workers where I come from) were typically unionized WWII & Korean War veterans. They had good paying jobs and benefits. Many of their children followed in their footsteps. The Democratic Party owned these families. The Republicans were still the party of the more affluent. But as the jobs of blue collar workers have been eviscerated over the last fifty years, the worker class has felt a sense of abandonment by the Democrats. When you take away the jobs and pride of a large portion of the middle class, should it be surprising that these Americans would look elsewhere for affirmation of their worth? When Hillary Clinton made her now famous reference to the \u201cdeplorables\u201d, she implied that many Americans supported Donald Trump due to racism, misogyny, xenophobia, and homophobia. While a certain part of our population can be rightly accused of these traits, I\u2019ve always felt the deplorables reference was a convenient straw man to cast aside the worker class. The Democratic Party has obviously moved on (or abandoned) this large segment of our society. The worker class continues to have worth. The Democrats would be wise to bring them back to their fold.",

However, I have a theory about American democracy that leads me to believe that if she is not elected, Sanders is our best option. Why? Because the main forces that led to Trump are forces that the moderates would not fix or even try to. Skyrocketing inequality is the primary reason. Labor instability, declining unions, and a stubborn neoliberal belief in markets as a cure-all, even amongst Democrats, led to a system of corruption and economic uncertainty that stoked racial anxiety (I mean, I think it\u2019s no coincidence that the civil rights movement happened at the moment of the greatest economic equality the US had ever seen). I find it very hard to believe that any of the moderate candidates - Biden with his unshakable belief that the GOP can be reasoned with, Buttigieg with his Silicon Valley donors and no national experience, and Bloomberg\u2019s infuriatingly arrogant attempt to buy himself the nomination - would deliver enough tangible benefits or change to alter the underlying forces of Trumpism. Those forces need to be tackled or we will be left with even greater cynicism and likelihood of another, smarter Trump in the future. Even average Republicans want improved access to healthcare, more job stability, and a better safety net, as long as you take political labels out of the mix. If the next President delivers little change, I think the result will be very, very scary.",

Now some people see Biden or Bernie as the savior, after first liking Elizabeth, others see Pete.  But none of the candidates have rallied anything approaching a majority of democrats in their support.  Now Bloomberg will have his day, after avoiding the denigration rampant in the first few primaries, focusing instead on dissing Trump.  Right now I'm seeing Bloomberg as the Biden substitute, and perhaps as such, a savior, but the only time I've seen him give a speech was in 2016.  If he's at the debate tonight, I'll see how he stands up to fire.  If he doesn't do well I'll keep looking for a savior.  Keeping my fingers crossed.  In the meantime I'll vote blue, no matter who.",

Re-heating Obama's left overs, they assumed that Biden would be the next person in line for the nomination because it was \"his turn.\"  In this age of political upheaval that is extremely short sighted and assuming way too much, especially when we are discussing Uncle Joe, who is a good man, but seems to be an incredibly weak candidate.  \n\nAs Buttigieg rightly pointed out, most of the\naccomplishments in the Obama administration should be attributed to Obama.  As for Buttigieg, he has everyone fascinated by his new car smell and appears to be the newest darling of the centrist wing, despite his lack of experience.  He looks great (I love mentally imagining him onstage debating Trump) and he's very quick and articulate. But his new car smell doesn't necessarily translate into new or good ideas.  \n\nIf Bernie is the candidate, he certainly has my vote.  He's the only candidate who brings his own ready made following to the party.  Folks say he is unelectable, but I  don't see any other candidates who inspire the kind of loyalty he does, except for Trump. My first choice is Elizabeth Warren, who reminds me of a modern day FDR, but if she doesn't make the cut, Sanders is closest to her in terms of his positions.  Everyone keeps screaming about moving to the center, but I don't think the Clinton, \"GOP lite\" model is going to work for Democrats in 2020.",

The only reason Sanders supporters would NOT support the Democratic candidate, is if there are rule changes to block his campaign.  That is NOT a democracy.  Sanders seems to be a person of integrity, honest(attempted register conscientious objector during Vietnam War, not avoid with fake medical), caring - wanting a health and dental care system available to those who can not afford insurance( and then are penalized on tax day $695-$1K).  And Sanders resonates with those of us who are willing to send the small donations from time to time (in my case $2-$20) that we are able.  In the excitement of last week leading up to Iowa, I felt compelled to send small donations to Democratic Senate hopefuls in KY, SC, IA, and AZ and even, accidentally, to something called Stop Republicans (thought it was going to Amy McGrath).  Sanders supporters could be a great source of funding House and Senate campaigns, IF his campaign is respected and the rules are not changed every time he succeeds.

And then you go on to say \"It\u2019s been obvious for some time now that Biden is not nearly as vigorous as he once was.\" Bernie is older than Biden. He just had a heart attack. But he has the advantage of energy? Please.\n\nOn paper, Biden is the right choice. Yes, he's aging, and not very gracefully. Aren't we all? But he has the experience of being VP for 8 years to his advantage. Bernie has pretty much been a do-nothing Congressmen for his entire career. Oh, sure, he's a beacon of light for some of the younger voters, and if that gets them out to vote, good on that. But he's had no experience in national security or international geopolitics, and that comes out very clearly in his speeches. He is the wrong choice for Commander-In-Chief, by a long shot.\n\nSo is Warren, by the way.\n\nThe only qualification that matters is this - can the candidate beat Trump? Bernie can't. He couldn't even beat Hillary, who was a weak candidate. Trump would eat him alive in a debate. Warren is too bookish to combat Trump, too. Even an exhausted Biden is the one with the best chance to corral him. No one else even come close.\n\nListen... I'd vote for Biden even if he took up residence in his neighborhood funeral home. He's not the historically best candidate, certainly. But, Bernie? Suffused with energy or not, he'd be a complete disaster.",

The reality is that the campaign has barely begun.\n\nThe start in Iowa was a disaster, but the Iowa caucus system has always been quirky and never more than an artificial effort by Democrats and Republicans in the Hawkeye State to get an advantage over the rest of the country.\n\nThe New Hampshire primary is a more realistic barometer, but even that is merely a small state seeking out-sized importance.\n\nAs far as the candidates, there is a problem that Pete Buttigieg, only 38 and lacking a national backing, and Joe Biden, who is not the Joe Biden of 4 or 8 years ago, are the only moderate progressives. That leaves Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom are superb campaigners with good organizers.\n\nThe problem is that Warren, out of stubbornness, and Sanders, out of habit, are not electable across the country in states necessary to amass the requisite electoral votes. Both of them subscribe to radical economic policies. Sanders has the additional problem of being selfish and untrustworthy.\n\nThe answer is Michael Bloomberg, a good person who is much smarter that Donald Trump and just as tough.",

She has the added burdens of not being realistic on paying for Medicare for All and saying silly things like promising a grade school student in Iowa a veto over her choice of education secretary. At least Bernie is realistic -- he says he'll raise taxes on everyone to pay for universal health care -- and generally avoids saying and doing things that make him appear not serious. \n\nSecond, Biden is not to blame for the failure of Harris' and Booker's campaigns. Harris and Booker went nowhere for one simple reason:They didn't resonate with voters. This growing sentiment among Democrats that equity and diversity should somehow be forced on voters demonstrates a dangerous misunderstanding of the nature of politics. It is a brutal, Darwinian enterprise. You can never impose equity on people's candidate preferences. \n\nIn closing, I would remind Democrats of Al Davis' famous exhortation to his Oakland Raiders: Just win baby.

Harris got a ton of money from CA donors and Cory had some national recognition. They dropped out because they never resonated with a meaningful share of voters.",

Trump is beyond is mental illness and criminality, a fairly standard corporate conservative.

His vision is for a radical and permanent redistribution of wealth and income and the expansion of the non defense public sector.

Her key point is that swing voters barely exist \u2014 those centrist folks politicians believe determine election outcomes. Rather she says the red and the blue camps are not fluid any more, and voters aren\u2019t voting issues so much as this tribal affiliation. Whoever wins the Democratic nomination, Bernie included, will have a good chance of winning because the blue coalition is united in detesting Trump. The best quality a nominee can have is the power to motivate blue turnout. Doesn\u2019t this look like Bernie, with Biden collapsing and Buttigieg so white?\n\nI love Warren too, but Bitecofer notes that it\u2019s visionaries and bold plans that generate excitement, and Warren has tamed her rhetoric and now instead of talking boldly about reform keeps reverting to tales of her long-ago hardscrabble (Republican) girlhood. This smells like an attempt to appeal to swing voters to me, and I think Bitecofer is right \u2014 there aren\u2019t any these days. Centrism is a losing strategy.",

Instead, he has done just the opposite. He has improved the lives of the poor, of Americans of color, and the rest of us by creating an economy with 3.5% unemployment, 3.5% mortgage rates, $2 a gallon gas and a booming stock market.

Their grandmas and grandpas---those rolling around in the mud at Woodstock, whom thought (and were taught as precious Babyboomers) that they were oh-so-special and the world revolved around them---exemplified the very essence of the \"me\" generation.  Now, two or three generations on, we've perfected me-ism to razor sharpness.  Schooled in leftist ideology and 'groupthink', bred to honor only one's own uniqueness, our young march off into the world, infinitesimal attention spans grasping only the most basic of 'scare' media headlines and viral 'tweets'.   Unable to brook nuance or subtlety, they are then duly armed with the modern weaponry that only serves to heighten self-exaltedness, the smartphone and social media.\n\nIn short, tens-of-millions of self-important emperors have been unleashed on society.  Is it any wonder, given the limits of their experiences, that younger Americans are delirious with desire for offers of 'free' healthcare, 'free' college tuition, 'free' everything?\n\nIn this environment, the old-fashioned virtues of patience and hard work wouldn't sound that great to me either.",

A fundamental realignment of the is underway in the Democratic Party, just like the fundamental realignment that shook the GOP four years ago.

When you are deeply embedded in the power structure of the establishment you tend not to see things that don't conform to its well-oiled preconceptions.  \n\nThere has always been a deep socialist strain among Democrats--support of socialism and even outright support of communism itself have always been a driving force in the party.  It has waxed and waned, but has always been the specter in the attic.  Open support of communism in the 1930's drove the party to the left.  FDR deftly coopted the movement, and JFK locked the guy in the attic.  \n\nNow that specter is out of the attic.  Bernie is what he is, and he's never sought to hide it.

Regardless, we were captivated by Sanders recognition of the struggles of the middle class, but we moderates and independents are bitter when we think of how his disgruntled supporters gave us Trump. Will they do this again? The Democratic Party began this year in chaos, with too many non viable, non-electable candidates. It passed over plausible Senators and Governors that could have made a difference. They made this a TV show. The Democratic Party is not focused on defeating people like McConnell, one of Trump's top henchman. Look at the top candidates. Buttegieg is very inexperienced and his marriage may be an issue. Warren is a women, too closely tied to Obama, who now has a tainted legacy. (He failed to stand up to McConnell).  Biden will be buried under the Ukraine story. (Republicans will investigate the heck out of his spoiled and thoughtless son). Republicans get jobs for family members but liberal media ignore this hot news.  Dems fear tough issues, like abortion. Stop. Believe in choice. This is also not 1970, and choice may need redefinition. Only Bloomberg seems fearless enough to take on the hard issues. He can bring the country together again. Will the Democratic Party stumble away from a good thing? Should we sell the farm and look for somewhere else to live?",

Let's face it, the republicans will throw the kitchen sink at any democrat in November. Bernie thrives when people throw the kitchen sink at him. He will not be phased or put on the defensive by these attacks, And it's not just my positive analysis of his political skills that should give you some optimism. Look at the polls. Of course, we can't be too reliant on them. But they have consistently shown Bernie doing pretty well against Trump. And there is a political logic that explains this. Bernie has a genuine appeal to many independents and the kind of white working-class voters that turned the last election. And in Vermont, amongst an electorate who know him best, he's winning something like 75% of the vote in his senate races in a state that has a republican governor.",

The Democratic party stands for nothing really and for the past 30 years has offered a \"GOP Lite\" version of America, meaning most of the same economic policies that benefit the rich while offering slightly more tentative social policies than the religious zealots across the aisle.  The GOP embraces its core and feeds it daily and does better and better.  The Democrats look at their core ashamed and try desperately to move towards some \"center\" which offers really no substantial difference than the GOP economically.  My two cents is that the Democrats need to stand for something real and run on that and, if they lose, they lose.  And, if they win, get it done like they did NOT do during the first two years of Obama's administration when they had majorities everywhere but hid from helping the majority of Americans in an attempt to \"work\" with the GOP, which is a party nobody can work with these days and shouldn't bother until that party undergoes a seismic change.",

I also believe that the reason the mayors have come out in support of Bloomberg is primarily because they relate to the challenges of being a big city mayor, and they recognize his success.  Steve Benjamin, mayor of Columbia, SC, is black, and was among the first mayors to endorse him.  That tells me something.

They also vote in their self-interest, which involves pushing the bill for Medicare and environmental degradation onto the next generation without permitting the (expensive) reforms necessary to allow young voters access to housing, property ownership, or social mobility. Money is funnelled away from infrastructure that is valuable to younger urban voters, like trains, and towards ridiculous giveaways for the only voters who can sway the system, like ethanol and corn subsidies. \n\nFor all the hand-wringing, 'centrists' are simply being asked to face the fact that the firmly right-of-centre/conservative policies they prefer hold no benefit for the most active plurality of politically-engaged voters, who are disadvantaged in the current system.\n\nI was born in NY and the first thing I learned about national elections is my vote doesn't matter. Why should I support this system?",

The commercial, intellectual, ecological and strategic dimensions of this carbon-based international monetary system are seminally presented in Verhagen 2012\"The Tierra Solution: Resolving the Climate Crisis through Monetary Transformation\" (www.timun.net).

He is always lying. That's what real estate promoters do. But Sanders actually means it.\n\nI kind of get that, if you're sitting in a nice office in Manhattan, or Washington, what Sanders is saying sounds scary. It should. What he is saying is intended as a threat to the privileged. He has thought it through and picked the fight he wants. \n\nTo the unemployed auto parts worker or hog farmer in Illinois or Michigan, it does not sound scary. What is scary to people like that is the country's present trajectory, which takes us to a point where all the money is in the pockets of five people and everyone else is starving.\n\nIt's probably true that the future of the American democracy is on the line here, to a great extent. But the operational travails of the Democratic party are not the cause. The cause is something far more dangerous and sinister, a political strategy the fuses rapacious capitalism with racism. By appealing to the country's innate racism (Nixon's so-called southern strategy), the piratical capitalists have gained the upper hand. Sanders has risen by telling it like it is.",

Yet it seems that embodying all traits of both poles makes for the most complete individual human.

Dynamically embracing polarity sometimes and wholeness at others may be a way forward. Figuring out that dynamism is the challenge we are going through culturally right now. \n\nKeep digging.",

Both gendered, cultural, and political, the linear journey of the hero has seemed simplistic and marginal to our experience since I left adolescence. Previous to the \u201880s, the trope of man against the world was less frequent in popular fiction than groups and families on an adventure of some kind, and often of an optimistic nature. The intense rise of capitalism in the 1980s set us digging up older stories of the lone male beset and battling the world (yes, it is always the world\u2019s fault not his). In the realm of experimental fiction and poetry, women\u2019s visions have been at the forefront. I\u2019m thinking of the refracted, multiplicity of voices in Virginia Woolf and many others. TV and movies have used those written structures but lost the inclusive, diverse vision that was imagined. Violence is usually a failure of some kind\u2014the failure to look inward and see one\u2019s part in the story, the failure of leaders diplomatically, and the failure of basic humanity in men like the current occupant of the white house. Many multiple-voiced films are experimental and not easily available. Also, the art house films of the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s did not need a happy ending. The linear journey to a happy ending is a kind of measure of force in itself\u2014just like a smile isn\u2019t the right response to every situation. Even popular fiction can make room for sadness, for listening to the world around us.",

I am not going to qualify any aspects of it, except to comment that at the end of her article what flashed through my mind were the works of Schiller, Goethe and Hesse - each of those authors represented the \"feminine\" in the Divine Feminine - and throughout history others have as well. So it's looking to the spiritual of man/woman and understanding it from that POV.  There are higher aspects in man/woman and lower aspects in man/woman.  Ideally, a man must become an aspect of the higher man/woman and the woman a higher aspect of woman/man.  In movies we are seeing usually the opposite - so Hollywood, to create a \"strong woman\" gave her negative male indulgences of violence and crudeness.  In other words, they gave her the lower negative aspects of man.  But in reality, the higher aspects of man must be the same as those higher aspects in a woman - kindness, nurturing, loving, etc. So as society evolves so do our storytellers and I sincerely wish Brit the best on her transitional journey to being \"realized\".",

The characterizations were terrific and believable, however, and it's refreshing when a show refuses to shoehorn characters into gender when the plot does not call for it. \n\nMarling's work is a work in progress, as she herself seems to acknowledge.

They weren't, but they were an attempt to incrementally address the problems that faced people as they grew up or raised a family. Was that really so bad? Yes, the female characters were limited in their occupations. They were not champions of industry or the arts or political leaders. So, the reality can be adjusted. When did that die? When did women have to battle it out with men? When did they start going to war or battling alien enemies? When did they need to be as physically violent as men? Why was it necessary?\n\nIsn't it the times that are toxic? Must we kill the characters to tell a story? Won\u2019t that pendulum start swinging back to reality?",

Romance writers, for all their books are denigrated, write about issues close to the hearts of many women -- and while they used to be about Dave's wife or featured hard=charging females, there's a wide range of romance novels and a wide range of issues. \n\nI've also worked with the hero's journey format for writing stories. Looking at it as solely a reflection of the male experience is a shallow interpretation. The call to action can be much more subtle than that found in comic-book movies -- it can be the decision to take care of a sibling on the death of a parent or even the decision to bear children. And the hero's (or, in this case, heroine's) journey spins out from there, with all the same turning points -- but not necessarily those found in adolescent male fantasies.\n\nThe female experience isn't so narrow that women need to cringe away from being Dave's wife or a hard-charging woman who takes on masculine characteristics to succeed or even being an odd old woman with 18 cats. Why do some women feel they need to narrow the female experience to one way of seeing the world?",

Female sexuality takes a lot more explaining; movies about it are necessarily wordy and dialogue driven; that works better in a novel than a movie.\n\nWomen get a better shot at singing and songwriting, where the visual is less important.  Yes, to be a successful pop star you need to make videos, and so only the beautiful need apply, but songs by and about women and female sexuality are well represented in today's music, and even in much of yesterday's.  Many of today's biggest music stars are female, and they're not successful primarily for their looks.  They certainly sing about female sexuality.  It works because the medium is primarily aural.",

The women in many of the films (be they comedies or dramas) were very strong, and went toe to toe with their leading men ( think of Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Katherine Hepburn, Lauren Bacall, etc.). They were smart and witty and fought back when men tried to dominate them. Sure,  sex was always under the surface and the filmmakers had to dodge the censors, but that led to some witty dialogue (see The Big Sleep).",

I've been feeling what she's written about for so many years,  and most painfully since our 2016 election and especially the national events of the past week.   He is not my President. \n\nWe need a woman in the White House,  but I'm sad to say that I don't see it happening in this country built on the macho fantasy of guns and cowboys.   \n\nEngland,  Germany,  Israel and India can elect females to lead their countries,  but we can't.  Why is that?  \n\nAnd while Buttigieg is appealing in his Obama-like speaking style,  he has a fraction of the governing experience of Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.   (Amy is terrific,  and I'd love to see her manage Trump on the debate stage. )\nSo why is Buttigieg polling so far above these two highly qualified women?\nI'm hard-pressed to reach any conclusion\nother than rampant misogyny in this country.   And that makes me very sad.\n\nAnd I know that I am speaking for many women and men,  because the degree of depression I've seen since the 2016 election is raging. \n\nVote!",

My favorite part of Orange is the New Black was its nuanced, textured characters we saw first through the lens of their flaws. And learned to love them from that way in. It made me realize how ravenous I was for female characters that seemed fully human. And it also reassured me that I wasn't the only one who knew women were human and someone aimed to portray that secret on screen.\n\nI formed my ideas of what women were supposed to be as a kid based largely on what I was on TV. It was discouraging. I remember being fully aware that no woman I saw seemed to reflect who I knew I was. So was hard to imagine growing up to join the real-life band of wives, girlfriends as strong female leads available to me when I didn't see myself in them at all. That's why this is important, and she is so right, how we shape our narratives determines a lot. The good news is, the truth is so much better than the lies we tell. In real life, women come in every form you can imagine, and many you can't. Every advancement we make in telling that feels like exhilarating release.",

You can't change a woman's DNA in 100 years, as much we would like to. \n\nAnd, if you're wondering why the narrative that a woman is only as valuable as her booty-shaking, grinding and beauty, look no further than the halftime Superbowl show.

Ms. Marling rightly offers the spectrum of humanity, the beautify of what each person in their earthly construction brings to the table; but, with respect, she doesn't offer us the nuanced approach I believe she possesses.\n\nI, for one, refuse to intentionally watch scenes of violence, particularly against women (admittedly excepting cartoonish or equalized versions such as in the Harry Potter world), not because I am squeamish (I'm not; I grew up on holocaust films), but because they don't add anything desirable to my mind's visual tapestry. Imagine the Devil in the White City replaying (once was too many, thank you), though perhaps that was because it was real.\n\nThere is no benefit in promoting violence, particularly as we cannot escape it, both important and sensationalized, in the news (especially where it is important for betterment, such as knowledge of sex trafficking).\n\nPity, though ...

Do you really think that men can't have empathy and fragileness?  As much as any woman?  If the author is complaining about the lack of female perspective understand that most men are complaining about the lack of substance and character of what they are seeing.  Why do you think so many \"christian\" promoted movies are being crowd funded?  Because the stories that are being told by \"hollywood\" and \"the media\" are stupid and unrealistic.",

No one is listening. No one gets the chance to lead just with her inner power and her energy and her goodness. \n\nMy friend has a job where she was the lowest status person in the place.

She should not have been the leader - a woman washing dishes is like a stereotype right? But her presence is so calm and dignified and assured and strong and genuine that everyone there just started to behave differently. It is not that she tried to assert herself it was just that with her around everyone felt better about the job, about themselves. \n\nShe makes people feel like  they have always had the all the strength and goodness that they will ever need right there within themselves.",

Mine is quite simply the story of a woman going through the most earthly and unique event of her life, the birth of a child, while working in the International Space Station. This unprecedented human event highlights not only the courage and love of this astronaut but her connection to every other woman who ever gave birth. While it is fiction, some might say science-fiction, the story is based in realism. It could actually happen tomorrow. There are many reasons multiple outlets have passed on the script, but I always suspect that it is because it is much closer to your vision of a female future in film than it is to the cookie-cutter male-driven films we have now. Or maybe it's that I am a male and I'm not allowed to write such stories. In any event, take a look at my script and see if some of what you're looking for is there.  Best, Doug",

The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel offers up some very strong women who aren't killing anyone or bossing them around pretending to be strong men. These older women come into their own with inner strength and determination and empathy. Maggie Smith and Judi Dench blossom through the movie, making mistakes and learning and living. Penelope Wilton grows from a fretting hanger-on to a person who is going to live life on her own terms no matter if others see her as shallow.\n\nAction movies will always have collateral damage. Examination of a marriage films tend to be trite and treat women poorly. Business women are often portrayed as caricatures.",

            "comment_body": "Great piece. \n\nI often think about the structure of ancient myth, and how those structures have filtered down to define and confine what is the essential male hero\u2019s quest. That quest, in a nutshell, is simple: go out and get, and bring it back. This structure is biological. It is a male hunting story, a story of men going out to get food, killing (or not) some sort of animal, and then eating it. \n\nSo it is difficult to find the ancient structures and possibilities of a woman\u2019s story in that vision of the hero\u2019s quest. Women were not, by and large, participants in that story. But the absence of women in that hero\u2019s quest points to other places to look. What was the woman\u2019s heroic quest in ancient society? What vital biological function did she provide? \n\nOne easy answer is fertility: not as a vessel for seed, but as a creative force of regeneration, brought about through pain, pleasure, sacrifice, and above all else, compassion. That I think is one place to start searching for the woman\u2019s story. Whereas the men\u2019s quest has all the same requirements\u2014the pleasure, the pain, the sacrifice\u2014a woman\u2019s story substitutes domination for compassion. And compassion is just as strong as domination. While the man dominates the weak, the woman cares for the weak and helps it grow strong. \n\nThis is an easy answer. It doesn\u2019t take much digging to find the Paleolithic fertility goddesses littering the world. But why not start there?",

I taught self-defense for years to women who had been sexually assaulted or were fearful of being assaulted (which is pretty much every woman on the planet). Not only are we taught through these endless stories of fear, death, and torture that it is inevitable that we should be victims, we're also taught that we shouldn't use our voices or our bodies to defend ourselves. What's not addressed completely here is how these stories also trap men and boys in similarly disastrous narratives. The lone survivor, the lone hero, the man who has to become lawless in order to defend, avenge, or 'make right' some wrong (that often involves his wife, girlfriend, etc. who has been brutally killed) is equally destructive. Cooperation and friendship is what has allowed the human race to survive this long, not competition, meanness, and violence. We've survived in spite of that. There has recently been more academic research into the history and pre-history of friendship and care, a much-needed corrective to the endless stories of war and competition that have dominated our stories about ourselves.",

At a minimum they are 125% superhuman in some key aspect, and often they are simply beyond even appearing like a realistic human being. Supporting characters are even less likely to be whole, due to the lack of time available to explore them and the incredible complexity of a whole human. Even documentary films which seek to present their human subjects in all their complexity simply cannot fully succeed in their allotted time. \n\nPersonally, I look to movies in large part to see how someone else would deal with problems I face (or fear facing) and see how that person is changed by the experience. In the story, I only need to see the elements of the character that drive them to make the choices they do. Huge portions of their history and personality become irrelevant distractions in this kind of story.\n\nCertainly, you can prefer another kind of story, but it is simply in the nature of a story to leave more out than you put into it.

Her power doesn't come from beating up the bad guys. She holds the alethiometer- a device that tells the truth. Only she can read it with ease, and she uses it to bring truth to those who need it. She also has a sharply honed knack for lying, and lies to those who would use the truth to harm others. (Or... who themselves hide the truth from people, and therefore don't deserve the truth themselves. Or who would harm Lyra if they knew the truth. You get the idea!) It's a fascinating twist on \"thou shalt not lie\", an idea from an oft patriarchal religion. She rejects it and uses her relationship with the truth to navigate her world.\n\nShe is also a strongly compassionate person, who's empathy is a key strength. For instance, she saves a boy who had been cut from his own soul. (A sight that would disgust most people too much for them to even consider helping him. Her compassion overcomes her horror.) \n\nHowever I'm also a fan of female characters that take this more traditional \"heroes journey\" and make it their own. Captain Marvel, Korra, Rey, and the new She-Ra are a step forward, for reasons I don't have enough space here to iterate.\n\nI do find it VERY odd that you think \"inciting incident, rising tension, explosive climax and denouement\" are inherently male. This quote also describes the female orgasm.",

Brit Marling also goes on to talk about the double standard that even when there the power of a strong female lead is caused by violence and domination. This conception was also created for male pleasure. How can we empower women and have strong leads without falling into patriarchal stereotypes and wants?",

In films of romance, women aren't victims of male aggression, and they don't imitate male aggression.  To quote Elvis Costello, \"What's So Funny 'Bout Peace, Love, and Understanding\"?  I.e., what's so wrong about love, marriage, and babies as the meaning of life for men and women, or at least a big chunk of the meaning of life?  Can't we save the world from climate catastrophe and have a rich private life, too?  Must it be all one or the other, as it is with grim-faced monks and revolutionaries?

And we have such a character in the western tradition: his name is Jesus of Nazareth. He even gets murdered in his own story(!), just like the female characters Marling mentions in The Big Heat and Chinatown. \n\nThis, I think, points to the larger point that empathy and other soft skills, when unable to be supported with force, are basically weaknesses in hyper competitive environments. What one would ideally want is a synthesis of the masculine and feminine virtues. When I think about what that really implies, it implies parenthood, which requires exactly this synthesis - fierce aggression to protect one's young, and compassion to care for them in their weakness, even when they reject your love.  The act of teaching is this writ large: a teacher who is too hard will be a vain tormentor to the student; a teacher who is too soft will be unable to get them to take him or her seriously and vital lessons will be dismissed. Yes, replace the damsel in distress with the object of the child, and both men and women will be able to act out masculine and feminine qualities in stories (perhaps the emphasis on youth culture is why we don't see this as often). \n\nAs aside, I highly recommend both 'The Incredibles' films by Brad Bird if you haven't seen them.",

Instead, just as you have created a parallel path to success in Hollywood, women in corporate America have to create their own companies, their own media outlets, and their own inventions that model what women-led organizations can achieve.  Oprah Winfrey did exactly this.  She knew as a woman and a person of color she was not going to make it as an anchor on CBS News. She instead took the Phil Donahue audience participation model and turned it on its head.  Her subsequent success as a producer of under-represented stories, writer, and talent is now in the history books, with a level of influence rarely wielded by women in pursuit of the greater good.\n\nThe point is, we're not going to change the likes of Goldman Sachs or Microsoft from within to force them to be more inclusive.

I also find her binary labeling of human behaviors as either \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" to be regressive and unhelpful.

The fact that she was a woman had nothing to do with it, nor did her looks (she looks very nice by the way, and I do not mean that sexually), it was her smarts and her attitudes that I found impressive. The OA was excellent, but not because the hero was a woman.\n\nPeople need to stop checking tally boxes when it comes to the arts. Do we have enough women musicians? Enough black authors? Enough transgender actors?\n\nThat's not the point. I enjoy people and fiction for their message and creativity and their ability to engage our thoughts and emotions. What gender the actor or creator is, or what race, has nothing to do with it.\n\nThe description of the typical elements of story-telling as being based upon a male orgasm is preposterous.\n\nStop thinking 'how many males? how many females? how many whites? how many blacks?' and focus on good storytelling. Your gender or race won't end up mattering.\n\nWomen, do you really want set-asides for your creative work, like when a loving but poorly skilled budding kindergarten artist whom adults have to falsely praise even if the art stinks? I would think not. Compete with men and women and if you do it well enough people won't have to give you false praise because you're a woman, but real praise because you're a HUMAN.",

            "comment_body": "How short sighted can one be? To look at the wasteland of Hollywood comic book films and complain that there are no good female characters? Have you noticed that there are no good male characters as well?\nIf you want to find the real feminine characters go to movies and stories of the past before Hollywood collapsed. Go to the innovative work being done by filmmakers in other countries. Is Lady McBeth a weak character? Is the Miracle Worker? Watch Bong Joon Ho\u2019s Mother for a strong feminine character.\nThe problem is this writer refuses to see the biological destiny that animates both male and female characters. The well known male character arc is going out into the world to face dragons and coming back changed and as a hero to save the town. Because men have always had to live and work outside the home. Women have always worked inside the home and thus they are linked with the protection of children, supporting her man, and creating a village. When we look in these directions we see millennia of strong feminine characters with depth and purpose. The problem is two fold: one, our national pastime of movies has artistically degenerated into a children\u2019s pablum served with special effects through advertising campaigns, and two, today\u2019s feminist mindset rebels at the notion of a biological destiny determining the character of the feminine. That mental block is what stands between today\u2019s writers and a truly empowered female character. Pick up a pen and write for a woman\u2019s world.",

However, I take exception with \"Blade Runner.\" Regardless of Hollywood misappropriation, Marling either never read the book or misunderstands the original story. Philip K. Dick was much closer to Ursula K. Le Guin than you might think.\n\nFundamentally, the question Dick asks is a philosophical one: Why does Richard Deckard love a live goat more than an android woman? That's why the novel is called \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" Strictly speaking, we're not even sure Deckard is human in the original writing. He might be an android programmed to kill other androids. This would explain his unhealthy obsession with normality and \"live\" animals. Needless to say, his empathy is often misdirected. The book gets complicated from there.\n\nRachael Rosen for her part is a femme fatale. Despite her speculative lack of humanity, her character is both feminine and vengeful. Spoiler alert: The goat dies. What happened in \"2049\" or indeed the original theatrical cut is mostly wrong about what the story is actually telling us. \"Electric Sheep\" absolutely meant to question what it means to be human regardless of gender.",

            "comment_body": "I agree that these Strong Female Leads are a problem, but I think the reason is different from the one given in this essay. There are many ways to be feminine, just as there are many ways to be masculine, and being practical, competent, authoritative and physically strong should not be seen as the domain of men. The central problem with Strong Female Leads is not that they're inherently masculine, but that they're not fully developed characters. \n\nAnd the reason for that, I think, is fundamentally sexist. The double standard that exists in real life, in which women have to be twice as competent as their male counterparts in order to get the same level of respect, exists in fiction as well. So while a male hero can be flawed, can have weaknesses as well as strengths - can be, in other words, a human being - a female hero is too often expected to be perfect at everything. So she ceases to be a character at all, and becomes a collection of skills - as you've said, a robot rather than a human being.\n\nReplacing \"masculine\" strengths with \"feminine\" ones isn't going to do anything to solve this problem, because the writer is still thinking about female characters collectively and in terms of a set of very gendered qualities. I would rather see her put the emphasis on writing women as individual human beings.",

Thinking about it it\u2019s all too true that such females in these roles are applauded for their masculine physical capabilities and their female bodies. We are setting an example of \u201cthis is a strong woman\u201d neglecting to add the fine print that this is not achievable. I wish we would embrace all females as all men are embraced. It is undeniable that there is far greater diversity of male bodies/faces in cinema than there are of females. That isn\u2019t art, it\u2019s propaganda. \n\nI am just beyond taken by this article, thank you for being the voice of change and not of confinement.

How do I know if a book results in the violent death of a woman? Easy. Just don't read any murder mysteries or paperbacks. That just about covers it and what I miss, I can get reading the reviews. If I realize a third of the way that I have stumbled into one of these stories, I quit.\n\nNo on may have known of my one-woman revolt but I know. I refuse to let that garbage enter my head.\n\nAnd it is garbage. It doesn't uplift; it tears down.\n\nI think we need more women like YOU writing the narrative and creating our own stories. Women are not inherent shadows. We are fully dimensional human beings. \n\nWhen my twins were born, I sat behind them one day while they both played. From the back, their nearly identical bald heads made it hard to discern which was which.....\n\nAnd I thought to myself, \"Why should one baby expect less out of life than the other due to gender,\" and then, noting my daughter's FIERCE personality, I also thought \"and who the hell is going to tell her that?\"\n\nAnswer---NOT ME.",

The writer here references wanting to be free as the child she remembers being. Well you don't say! Who wouldn't love to be paid for that self-indulgence. \n\nThe self-reference of actors is tedious. They're not going to change the world by playing at being other people. If you want to make real change, do real work in the real world, stop thinking you're that important or special - nobody is. I mean, you're in the movies; that is not a field populated by service-oriented people. Acting, whether by men or women is about ego. Did she really expect that world to be motivated by good, social justice, equality, awareness? How naive. The worst people go into that business, male and female, happy to pretend to kill, hurt, rape, strip, have sex, whatever \"the role\" calls for. Actors, in short, want to be famous and are happy to do anything to achieve it. \n\nSeriously. Get another job and go help women out in the real world, otherwise you're just a kid in the playground. The movie \"industry\" will never care about the rights of anyone but the financers, not equality, or justice. It is motivated by profit. No movie ever changed anythng, ever.",

            "comment_body": "Maybe the intended audience was only feminist women.  But I find the article a bit maddening.  Brit Marling clearly has a deep and knowledgeable perspective on culture, in particular books, TV, and movies, but it seems to be from a distorted \"everything is about female oppression\" perspective.  As a result I think she has a somewhat incomplete view of culture.\n\nThe Hero's Journey is not fundamentally about men or the male orgasm.  Clever line, but not true.  It's about heroism and learning.  The protagonist leaves their comfortable life to go on an adventure, during which they overcome challenges, make mistakes, face their inner demons, and ultimately grow as a person.  That can describe any person of any gender.\n\nThere are stories other than the Hero's Journey.  For instance, you could have a story like Paddington Bear where the protagonist's fundamental goodness changes the world around him into a better place but the protagonist does not change.\n\nI think the author is also missing the male perspective.  For most people life is about a balance between the masculine and the feminine.  While men might strive for a masculine ideal, too be hyper masculine all the time is suffocating.  Ultimately there can be more strength in caring and empathy than in really big muscles.  Also, Hollywood (and other careers) are very challenging for men too.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had to write Good Will Hunting to get this big break.  So you wrote your own stories too.",

On the one side there\u2019s the Teletubbies show, quite safe, almost no dialogue and very boring for an adult watching with the kids\u2014then on the other side are the breast implants mom talked about, very male-centric therefore exciting for men; also requiring little dialogue. Add to that some guns and fast cars and the dialogue can be one step above Teletubbies quality; a sad state of affairs.\n\nRarely is produced the movie with the perfect combination of the middle ground containing substance and it is so rare because it\u2019s hard to put together. Marylin Monroe wanted it badly but it mainly alluded her because the body sold way more movie tickets than the mind!\n\nStripping the power positions, conflict, guns, sex, booze and such out of a movie generally creates a glob of something no one wants to watch at a movie theater unless one is really, really good at putting the movie together in a way where average things become bigger than life. Make: 12 Angry Women, the film, where Harvey Weinstein is the accused.",

I will buy that book, watch that film, stream that series.\n\nThis statement left me floored: \u201cI imagine excavating my own desires, wants and needs, which I have buried so deeply to meet the desires, wants and needs of men around me that I\u2019m not yet sure how my own desire would power the protagonist of a narrative.\u201d\n\n(Hangs head.)\n\nKeep working on it, please.

I'd suggest that even though your stated goal is to transcend these attributes, you're promoting stereotypes in the process. Can you really say that there are no men with empathy or who listen to other people or that those who do are feminine? Do you really believe that the world is devoid of women who are aggressive and egocentric or that those who are are really being mannish?

So the strong female leads need to have these features in order to please audiences.  \n\nThere is also a concern that brainy females who don't meet the above criteria upset aggressive men, who see them similar to weak males who can be easily overcome. \"Irritating feminist\" is an apt description.\n\nAll this will get worse in the new Trump era and that of his successors.  Women don't come together in groups, so single female will be increasingly vulnerable, until they start again being protected by male relatives.  So the feminism of their mothers and grandmothers will be regarded as a foolish dream.\n\nThese news are terrible, but the evolutionary traits and the emotions that they move seem to prevail over reason.  The writer needs to get back to a decent job and prepare her daughters for the brave new paleolithic world.",

By definition- isn\u2019t that all of us - the human experience? \n\nWe\u2019re are all vulnerable from the time we\u2019re born. The world is a cruel, cold place. The \u201cmasculine\u201d way has been to shield oneself from strong emotions- stuffing them down, not expressing them, stiff upper lip.  Honestly, do you really believe this is strength? Hiding behind a barrier of false protection has been proven to be a very toxic way to go through life. Cowering in the face of vulnerability as though we have a choice? Keep fooling yourself. It\u2019s a great way to shut out emotional growth, ruin relationships, & perpetuate an unhealthy way of life to the next generation. \n\nAccept that vulnerability is a part of life. There is no way to avoid pain. It is what makes us grow. Perseverance & resilience are the ultimate gateway to strength. Not chasing away those emotions, fully experiencing them, accepting our own vulnerabilities is to say yes to a more fulfilling life. \n\nDr. Brene Brown is an expert on vulnerability. Watch her Ted Talks. Read her book \u201cThe Power of Vulnerability.\u201d Key word being \u2018power.\u2019 A powerful quote of hers:  \u201c... Vulnerability is not weakness; it's our greatest measure of courage.\u201d \n\nBut you won\u2019t seek out her research, as already decided empathy is for weaklings.

The subject of our ridicule approached the group, and members of the group demanded an answer of her: did you kiss him?\n\nI'll never forget the girl's eyes going wide with terror at the question, but she didn't flinch.  Softly, she just said \"yes,\" she had kissed him.  \n\nI'll never, ever forget that \"yes.\"  Her interrogators, thrown off-balance from her brave confession, did not pursue the subject further, but the girl's courage in that moment hit me like a ton of bricks.  I was totally disoriented, stunned, unable to speak.  The feminine power you're searching for, Ms Marling, is real, and as forceful as the bullet from a gun.",

But my awful scripts get shoved in a drawer, or ceremonially thrown on the fire, because I recognize that they\u2019re awful and I don\u2019t want anyone to read them. The burning is part of the learning.\n\nI think one of the biggest problems is that female writers feel pressured to get something, anything on paper. Doesn\u2019t give enough time to let the story marinate and become what it really wants (needs) to be. \n\nAs a female writer quietly plucking away at short stories and screenplays, I\u2019ve struggled in the past to know how far is too far with my female characters. How believable is this strong female lead? What are men going to think about her? But when we ask ourselves these kinds of questions, we\u2019re still perceiving ourselves through the eyes of men. Until we arrive at a point where we can honestly say \u201cI don\u2019t care what you think because this is my story and I\u2019ve revised it a million times now, and I\u2019ve let it simmer, and I know I\u2019m telling it the way it needs to be told,\u201d then we really don\u2019t have a finished story worthy of publishing/production, do we?\n\nBecause so much about writing has to do with getting over the fear of being judged. It\u2019s harder for women, but it\u2019s necessary. \n\nSo here\u2019s hoping Greta Gerwig wins the Oscar for Adapted Screenplay since she was snubbed in directing. Her story is what needs to be rewarded anyway, because the story is the key.",

A typical woman's heroic journey may be different, in that it probably involves more nurturing of others but just because making sure someone stays alive involves years instead of one exciting battle doesn't mean it is less heroic. Try coming home from the hospital with a tiny, defenseless creature who depends on you for everything (after carrying it around in your body for nine long, uncomfortable months and then going through God knows what to bring it into the world) and then sacrificing to take care of that person until he can take care of himself.\n It is so common, we forget how hard it can be. It doesn't involve weapons, so it would take a sensitive, long, involved narrative to tell the story. \nOr, the heroine could be shown navigating the world where she constantly has to be on her toes to avoid sexual assault, while working at a crummy job to put herself through college, or where she is running for public office and has to figure out just the right thing to say to be recognized as a strong leader but not too pushy.

Isn\u2019t that an iron rule of human societies that to rise through human structures, you need large amounts of ruthlessness, drive, over-confidence, selfishness, domination, willingness to use some amount of violence? Sadly, you don\u2019t climb up and stay in power by being empathetic, sensitive, listening, kind, competent, and having people reward you for those. I think that\u2019s a pipe dream to hope otherwise. That\u2019s why I tend to think that the lack of women at positions of power in human structures also reflects, on top of a bias against women, a bias against people displaying the latter qualities - bias which can also affect men, but women tend to display the latter traits more than the former (even if there is a lot of overlap, of course). And why women in power today (in reality or in stories) are essentially men in women\u2019s clothes, as Brit Marling notes. \n\nIn short, it\u2019s not that we only celebrate masculine modalities of power - it\u2019s that power amongst humans is what it is, and perhaps men are more often geared towards seeking it than women.

It is within all of us to have and develop any of these.  Gendered socialization either encourages of stymies what all people naturally posses. How about we start telling stories about characters that offer realistic complexity and nuance. Along with the author I also dream of stories that speak to and about all of us.

It's tempting, for the promotion of a necessary shift in power-sharing, to focus on gender. Yet doing so, exclusively, obscures a paramount underlying current human misconception which is that we are still in a naked fight for survival. Society, hence, hails the qualities it considered most needed for said survival -- brawn, ability to dominate, cunning, ruthlessness. What we need is a declaration of the end of the era of survival and the beginning of the era of life affirming creativity and vision. And in this new era what we need to hail more than anything else is the one trait that is responsible for getting us this far in our evolution: our inborn mutuality that leads to cooperation, sharing, and altruism. Where gender needs to be brought into the discussion is to support an initiative that stops training men-identified individuals out of these inherent competencies.",

Rarely did the systems hold men responsible for their use of violence.\n\nI decided I would get a Masters in Political Science to change the system. Once in school, I realized I played the same role seen in the movies.  The predominantly male professors treated me less than the male students -- less smart, more sexual  -- my contributions often ignored.

Empathy, often associated with the feminine, can open up a discussion.  Often, while men think about power and money, women think about relationships and concerns for the harmed.  Over the last few decades, the beauty and value of women diminished.  \n\nWith the rise of women as directors, story writers, and political leaders, my hope is women determine the value of women and rewrite these long-entrenched scripts that devalue and debase females.",

And I started watching OA and was terminally exasperated by it, especially by the female roles in it. I quit watching after a few episodes, as it was giving me a headache.\n\nIt appears to me as if the actor/author has a preconceived and idealised and above all very, very gendered concept of what women have to be. No, a harsh, active, non-empathetic, butch woman isn't trying to be a man. She is a butch woman. And there are at least as many goal-centric women around as men. \n\nIf you tell me about a problem, for example, I will suggest a solution to you. I won't take you in my arms, I won't hug you, and I doubt I will commiserate. I'm not empathetic. I prefer to find solutions and expect the other to implement some solution. I'm not that rare either. But your concept of feminity doesn't include the likes of us.\n\nPeople are people. We need to leave gender behind us, it isn't helpful to set up some holier than though concept of the female \"gender\" to counter patriarchy.",

It is a constant. It is what gatekeeping does. \n\nThose who say we must have gatekeepers to make things work at all imply that all we need do is perfect the people who are gatekeepers. If only they would never abuse their power. If only they'd be nice to everyone and always make the right choices. Nonsense. People are not perfectible. Power corrupts.\n\nYou give such power, and you give corruption. It is Lord Acton's truth, \u201cPower tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.\"\n\nWe have the wealth and position of deep development as a society to provide for everyone the basics, so that no gatekeeper can deny food, shelter, medical care, basic security.\n\nThere may always be big employers driving a big economy, and gatekeepers to it, but we need not give them the power over economic security or safety. That is a choice. We empower that extreme of gatekeeping.\n\nLook closely as Progressive politics today. Underneath, it is to limit the power of gatekeepers. It is about real freedom.\n\nThat is the truth Brit Marling touches here.",

Of all the current societal issues, I find the idea that some qualities belong to one gender or another, and that those categories have to be embraced or pushed back against to be at the heart of a lot of personal distress and societal unease.",

But even with their limited scope of themes, the woman's film industry put the woman at the center of the cinematic universe. No such industry exists today, (other than Lifetime movies and soaps) though I long for a time when female-driven movies could be as prevalent as their opposite. But unlike Ms. Marling I believe that story itself is beyond gender. The trick may be to use the same forms to give women, gay men and women, non-binary and asexual characters a clear and unique voice. End game: diversity and great storytelling.",

If older (60s-70s,) secondary female characters aren't comfortable grandmothers, they often engage in inappropriate flirting with younger male characters (i.e. they cannot be imagined beyond the maternal or sexual aspects of their characters.) \n\n2) The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina: there are three main roles for women in their 40s and 50s\u2014well-developed interesting characters; one is dumpy; one has great costumes; two are competently ambitious. They all have relationships at some point in the series, but these are recounted from their own female perspectives, fit into the overall plot, and are just one aspect of well-rounded characters who are up to all sorts of things.",

I thought the exact opposite. The reason we, or at least some of us, want more women in positions of power is precisely because they don't behave like men. Wonder Woman solves her problems by beating up or killing the bad guys, attractively and in her underwear. Despite the skimpy costume, that's a stereotypically male way of dealing with things, and not what I would want the young girls of today to think they need to become as women.",

Then I played Annie Sullivan in The Miracle Worker\u2014a woman who bucked the patriarchy in Helen Keller's own home in order to let Helen live fully\u2014and felt right at home.

Because of that perhaps, many of her own roles have fallen victim to the same fates that she decries.  Good luck to Ms. Marling in finding her third way for female characters then, but in looking at her own work which she discusses here, the convention is generally still going to dictate the result.",

Good for Ms. Marling for doing the same. \n\nAt the same time, I do enjoy certain movies where women are strong and physically forceful. I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer, who beat up vampires but also cried over her first sexual experience. While it's time for film and television to show more of our feminine aspects and the value of those aspects, that doesn't mean we can't celebrate those of us who literally are the physical embodiment of strength. They exist around us too, in our armed forces, sports and astronauts, to name a few. Let's not deny them, but embrace our full womanhood and all of its expressions.",

Thank you for this absolutely stunning piece of insight and paean to the future.\n\nI've been saying for years that women must work to change how they're portrayed in movies, books, magazines, online and anything else that seeks to diminish us.\n\nWe've been over-feminized and over-sexualized by the media and corporations seeking to enrich themselves by the commercialization of our bodies and faces.  Almost no attention is paid to our intellect and emotions.  They appear not to exist, unless monetization can ensue.\n\nYour analysis of how we've been portrayed in the movie industry is striking and excellent.  You've experienced what it means to be diminished by men in a patriarchal society and you've embarked on a journey to help change this anti-female mentality.\n\nWhile I'm a fan of your acting and writing talents, it's your intellect and need to find your place in our society that marks you as a woman of extraordinary self-awareness and courage and drives home the need for change-immediate and everlasting.",

Coming up 80s unsure of whether the democratic experiment would survive, through the 90s where democracy won, I have seen the shift to a heightened sense of awareness and informational overload which I believe can be very confusing to many. Bottom line, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is an inalienable right for all MAN,( Species not Gender). Under this guidance, I believe, so long as no harm is being done to environment, animal, or persons, we should take solace in all that has been achieved. I for one, love the new generation of women coming up, more confident, brash, brave, adventurous, educated, awake and aware of who they are and where they want to go, whom they want to be and within their time lines and desires!\nI could not be happier for them and I look forward to when We have our first female president. Having been raised in the 70s as a child seeing how my male elders treated with scorn the women\u2019s lib movement, as I saw my mother cower under the iron fist of my father, with no access to mediation or assistance filled with fear, I am happy to see this to become rarer on this side of the world. Hopefully Brit, will not shy away from being the strong female lead. It seems to me, in reality, outside of movie roles, she already is one!",

I don\u2019t agree with that line of thinking and maybe that\u2019s also part of the problem.  Those are human characteristics!  All of us can have those traits as humans.  I just feel that we need to be more thoughtful about looking at the array of our physical, emotional, and intellectual capacities (in whatever variation or proportion) as human and not align any of them with a particular gender.  I\u2019ve known and personally met various women who are not all that empathetic, caring, or vulnerable, and several men in my life who are...and vice versa...",

Co-directed by a woman and with a screen play written by a woman, the movie's 2 female protagonists are \"strong leads\" but not always stereotypically so. In particular, Elsa is a complex and fascinating figure . She does go on a \"hero's journey\"--one of the most beautiful I've ever seen visualized- and has a classic moment of struggle that leads her to find a deeper self. But she is not punished for her new self knowledge and the film's ending is unexpected, liberating and moving. Yes, it's a cartoon but maybe animation can take us places that realism can't.",

I was drawn to acting because I felt it would allow me to become the whole, embodied person I remembered being in childhood \u2014 one that could imagine freely, listen deeply and feel wholeheartedly.\"\n\nIf you want to act for these reasons, you don't have to do it in Hollywood or on Broadway. If you are driven by this internal motivation, this desire for personal meaning, then community theatre works too. Taking courses at your local community college. You don't have to act.\n\nI see so many people striving after fame and fulfillment. I understand the impulse. It's not wrong in any sense to my mind, but it shrinks one's options and paths enormously, like it seems to have for the young Ms. Marling. \n\nThe young people I work with want to change society, do good, be rich, and  also famous. Reduce your aims by one or both of the last items and you'll feel far less anguish and defeat and your choices will be clearer. Be purposeful, be transformative to the person sitting next to you, make the place where you ARE better. Do \"less\" more meaningfully. \n\nI'm glad Ms. Marling has found her path and has brought her considerable insight to it. But, meaning in our lives can come from the small and local, too.",

People should make money by owning things instead of working.  Then they came up with supply side economics which is another scam targeted toward reducing taxes for the  top end thereby increasing their wealth and power.  Then they went after the estate tax to establish wealth dynasties. Then cam Citizens United and voter suppression and it was game over.  America is now a wealth aristocracy, a true plutocracy.\n\nNow here is the maddening part.  They got the blue collar working class to fall for it.  They did it through an anti-immigrant, white nationalist theme.  Trump, therefore, is not and never was their enemy.  He is their savior.  He has sealed the deal.  He has solidified the power of the wealth aristocracy by duping the working class to follow him to the ends of earth.\n\nThe Republicans could not have hoped for a leader better suited to achieve their end game than Trump.  That's why they all fell in line.  They were never out of line.  They just had to come up with a way to justify it.\n\nThe ends always justify the means.

They were still there as the war ended).\n\nThose Republicans with an ounce of sense see the writing on the wall; America is rapidly becoming a minority-majority nation, with Hispanic and African Americans growing and the white majority declining in numbers. In response, they are trying to hold the line by any means possible, including voter suppression, family disruption, and naked appeals to racism, among other tactics. Republicans have ripped up the Constitution to usher in despotic authoritarianism, politicized justice, and a neutered Congress; why? To insure their hold on power for as long as they can.\n\nIn this context, Trump is the GOP's savior. Trump is the perfect embodiment of this rearguard action. He's picked up all the worst instincts of the Tea Party and low information voters, and he gives rabid voice to those (like himself) who are desperately insecure in facing up to the changes surging over the nation.\n\nLike Italy, the fighting will be fierce and bitter.

Yes we suffer from being fallible, corrupt, highly discriminatory behavior against minorities, and view other cultures as highly suspicious in their motivation and intent. \n\nIn fact we could be diagnosed as downright paranoid about the \"Others\" by race, religion, or creed. This is current  play action at the Southern border, over immigrants' seeking asylum, Islam and terrorists, as well as a host of other imagined existential threats. So in all this why are we overwhelmed by the perennial class struggle?\n\nWe've been fighting this idea since 1776 all the way up to today. Trumpisms now (\"watch the birdie\"  misdirections) and Republicanisms from forever before are a certainty. FDR was called \"a traitor to his class.\" We have always beat them  eventually.

When progress has been made that means largely progress away from white supremacy and falling back generally means going back to white supremacy. This country's great wealth in its early years was achieved mainly by the free labor of black slaves. And its great expansion westward was achieved mainly by killing Indians or driving them onto reservation beyond the frontier. White supremacy had been fed by conservative talk radio for several decades but the election of a black president really reawakened it. And Trump exploited this reawakening into winning the presidency. White supremacist terrorism is now a bigger threat than jihadist terrorism in the US. Neo-nazis are reported to be organizing terrorist cells and there was concern that they would try to carry out violent actions at a recent rally of gun control opponents in Richmond, Virginia.

They astutely recognized that their political survival, individually and collectively, and power, were directly dependent upon pleasing their constituency. So they sold out. Playing racial and ethnic politics assures the GOP's hold on power. Constantly pandering to voters' unfounded fear mongering that dark complexioned individuals from overseas pose a national security threat to their employment, societal norms, and political power, divide and conquer is justified. And the Republican Party will continuing exploiting this fact. They know their constituents don't care what the draft dodger says or does, as long as he and the GOP protect, preserve, and defend the interests of WASP America. And their constituents, disproportionately blue collar, less than college, and even many more, less than high school, educated, lacking racial and ethnic diversity awareness, are resigned to their insular protectionism at the expense of promoting democracy.

They are single issue voters, and that issue is race. A large majority of white men (of all economic backgrounds) and even a majority of white women voted for Trump. And they are all still in lockstep with him.\n\nAnd for the return of white nationalism in this country, Trump voters will trade away the rule of law, fair and honest elections, and their Constitutional rights. Because what they most enjoy is seeing many of the rest of us suffer, even though they, themselves, are not doing any better. \n\nWhites will be the single largest voting bloc for many, many years to come. Democrats can \"fine tune\" their messages all day and run the \"ideal\" candidate, but they will never win the support of Trump voters, because to do so would mean these candidates would have to embrace bigotry.

He reversed the Obama administration\u2019s guidance requiring schools to give transgender students unfettered access to school bathrooms and locker rooms. He pushed for religious freedom protections. He pushed back against prior trade policies. The stock market is doing fairly well and the economy, if not great, is at least OK. I don\u2019t doubt that the author considers all of this bigoted or backward or regressive but most of the people I know are very much in favor of all of the above. They give Trump credit for following through on what he says he\u2019s going to do. No one I know watched the impeachment hearings, talked about them or thought Trump should have been impeached.  Maybe the author hears otherwise in the circles he moves in, but it\u2019s a bit of a bubble. Trump may very well win reelection.",

If he is we can expect drastic changes-- cuts in social welfare programs, medicare, medicaid, funds for scientific research, all promoting social progress.\n\nAccording to your premise this erosion will continue until it becomes unbearable to the majority and the country makes a lurch toward more social progress.  How long could this erosion last?  As you stated in your article some ugly periods have lasted for hundreds of years.\nIt's sad, really sad.

The press that isn't Fox News have embraced centrism and seem not to understand that know that the center is essentially authoritarian, because it has been skewed so far to the right over the past 40 years.  \n\nWe are in a great deal more danger than most people understand (leftists included).

Thank you, Mr. Bouie.\n\n\u201c...if backlash shapes our history as much as progress does \u2014 then the current moment is easy to understand.\u201d\n\nYES!\n\nTrump is the backlash of a two-term African American POTUS. Don\u2019t think for a second that these craven cowards who call themselves Republicans aren\u2019t keeping that in the back of their minds. They have to re-elect Trump to even the score. The entrenched racism is still at play, especially among Southerners, and I have no doubt that it influenced Sen. Alexander\u2019s decision not to convict.\n\nIn the South, we have a huge swath of the population who still thinks the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery. Most people I know in Alabama think it was fought over States Rights. Well, yeah... a state\u2019s right to enslave human beings. But somehow they just can\u2019t allow themselves to make that brain leap.\n\nI am a white Millennial and my father took us to every Civil War battlefield in existence during summer vacations. Like many white Southern men, he is obsessed with the Civil War. I grew up thinking the Union was \u201cjealous\u201d of the South\u2019s money. I grew up expected to join the Daughters of the Confederacy to celebrate \u201chistory.\u201d Well, I am thankful every day that I got educated beyond what was afforded me in Alabama. Now I\u2019m just saddened by what Southerners teach their children. It\u2019s revisionist, alternate universe history. No facts. Just backlash.\n\nTrumpism was born of backlash. Will Trumpists ever wake up to this truth?",

I am pessimistic about our future because we have been on the backwardness path for a very long time.\n\nLet's acknowledge that we have been on a path to crowning Trump for more than the one decade cited by Mr. Bouie. The decline in Republican constitutional patriotism and moral grounding has a long history dating back to Nixon who abused the power of the presidency and was crooked, but at least less of an outlandish crook than Trump.\n\nAnd don't forget Reagan - Trump's less offensive doppelganger demagogue. Reagan started the attack on unions and the middle class, and eroded the public's confidence in government. He undermined the progress towards a more perfect union while diverting attention with his feel-good (coded partisan) rhetoric.\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush was a holdover from the traditional fiscal conservative Republican Party and a brief reprieve from the trajectory of the party's moral and principled decline. But his son, W., returned the party to its backwards path, lying us into wars and ignoring capitalism's abuses which nearly capsized the American and world economies.\n\nTrump is not a moment in time. He, with the aid of an immoral party, is the triumph of worst over best. As W. B. Yeats observed,\n\n\"The best lack all conviction, while the worst\nAre full of passionate intensity.\"\n\nTrump is the \"rough beast, its hour come round at last.\"",

As a unified whole, Republicans are advocating autocracy in at least some variety.\n\nAs individuals, I'm not sure the same assumption is necessarily true. As former Senator Sherrod Brown noted the other day, Senators are primarily motivated by fear. There's fight or flight instinct associated with power. The road back to autocracy is paved with more moments of flight than they are with fight. Senators seeking self-preservation rather than an actual absence of concern. Ironically, the Republican Senate consistently gives away power in an effort to retain power.",

Adding to what Bouie says, it's maybe worth noting that as sporadic as the push for more democracy is in American history, it is even more rare in world history. Since large civilizations first emerged thousands of years ago, humans have mostly lived under autocracies where the few amass great wealth and power by exploiting the many.  We like to think of America as an exception, but as Bouie points out, it really hasn't been as much of an exception as our myths suggest. Slavery and other forms of oppression are far more essential to our history and national character than we care to admit and our respect for democracy, human rights, and rule of law much weaker than we believe. The blessings of democracy in America are a weak and flickering light, easily extinguished and absorbed back into the oppressive darkness of human history.",

The first step might not undermine but simply try to work within the new rules. But quickly if not immediately someone is figuring out how to game the system. Gaming evolves to the point of codifying the ways they (we) get around road blocks to our personal goals of wealth, political power, etc. The system of rules is twisted by those who were successful early solidifying their past gains and future prospects.

In a healthy democracy politicians must accept the fact that they will lose almost as many elections as they win.  Consequently, they will have to share power with individuals and groups whose goals clash with their own.\n\nThis feature of an open society can appear unacceptable to corporate moguls accustomed to having their own way or to politicians who reject the legitimacy of their opponents' right to compete for high office.  The survival of democracy requires a recognition that one's own interests do not define those of society and that a healthy republic depends on a wide distribution of political power.\n\nSuch enlightened attitudes fly in the face of human selfishness, which helps explain our checkered history as a free society.  Currently, Republican efforts to rig the electoral system reflect their fear that they cannot win fair elections.  Demographic changes threaten the viability of a party so heavily dependent on the white vote.  Trump's open contempt for other ethnic groups merely exposes the entire party's determination to rule despite the grim outlook for its electoral base.\n\nIt is difficult to cherish democracy when your political philosophy threatens to condemn you to a permanent minority status.  It was exactly this prospect which drove the South to attempt secession in 1861.  The GOP has decided on a different approach.",

Everybody has their own doubts, uncertainties, worries, struggles, etc. and why does yours -- being so elitist -- deserve to represent the \"life under lockdown\"? I see no point.

You even have the luxury of asking each other, \"Should we leave?\" I won't be surprised that you don't worry about income, but many who are locked inside worry about not having income when not being able to go to work. For doctors who have to go to work, which is also the case of some of my family members, that of course raises a lot of worries for family member. Everybody has their own doubts, uncertainties, worries, struggles, etc. and why does yours -- being so elitist -- deserve to represent the \"life under lockdown\"? I see no point.

One thing to look at is if your building uses common air ducts for ventilation that feeds the apartments - sometimes used in some high-rise buildings.  The air then gets recycled through common air ducts which makes the transmission of the virus much easier. Also given the population of Shanghai there would be limited availability of the more novel medications now being considered\ufffc for use in the most severe patients.

Might one be stranded on the way out of Hubei/China? Might one catch the disease on the way out and be quarantined or hospitalized? If traveling with family, what happens if one member comes down with coronavirus? What if various forms of international transportation will no longer accept passengers with passports from China, as has just happened with Princess Cruise Lines, and may happen with some airlines? What if certain destinations are no longer open to Chinese?\n\nPerhaps some NYT readers are already working on a risk-assessment algorithm to deal with such decisions and can share their wisdom by commenting here, or by cooperating with NYT writers in preparing an article.\n\nDeciding whether to leave or stay is an intensely personal process, informed by often sketchy information. Based on living and traveling in third-world countries, my experience has been that it is better to leave before conditions deteriorate and threats to life and limb increase to levels that local and national governments are unable to manage.\n\nFor me the fact that the US Embassy and most US nationals have been evacuated is a pretty good sign that it\u2019s time to go.",

The idea that this is somehow a more 'decadent' era seems a flimsy theory based on a highly simplistic reading of recent history.\n\nThe real story here is that we face the one of the greatest challenges of our lifetimes in changing our fossil-fueled economy to one that will allow our children and grandchildren to have a future on this planet. There are so many great solutions and ideas-- from Elon Musk's solar roofs and electric vehicles (granted well-marketed! and over-promising, but somehow he's not included here..) to new green infrastructures that can help adapt cities to rising sea levels and provide an expanded public realm. We just need to adopt these ideas, fund them in the same ways that previous generations funded trans-continental railroads and the suburbs and highways and sent a man to the moon. We need to look at the great ideas that are already out there and not complain about how tech is not leading the way. It seems to me that it's Douthart (and the current administration) that is the one who is being decadent, not the younger generations.",

One of those is describing the Trump administration as more or less a continuation of the Obama administration. Yes, the economy has grown largely at the same rate, and Trump has exaggerated the worst excesses of the Obama administration. But Ross has (perhaps on purpose) completely ignored the differences in judicial appointments and the management of executive agencies. On the bench, Trump has appointed extremist ideologues. For executive agencies, Trump has installed people who not only have a different idea for those agencies, but believe that those agencies should not exist in the first place. This has led to disastrous outcomes for workers, the environment, education, and otherwise. Charitably, maybe Ross is too insulated from the real world to perceive these effects.

The 2nd Amendment is a white male dominated epitaph thrust upon the rest of us.\n\nWhite male creative ideas get the green light. Innovations from women and minorities are still suffocated by white male dominance. Theranos is an exception --- a one in a million allowance --- because Theranos was a player who studied and became a master at how to get an idea past the white male phalanx.\n\nYou exempt Senator Elizabeth Warren from your paragraph about the presidential election. Warren has been steady removed by the press (white male dominated). Her removal from the white male political world has been breathtaking -- because, as James Carville recently pointed out, Warren is the singlemost outstanding Democratic candidate with the finest resume and highest qualifications. The white males at the top of the Democratic will deliver a deadly trance of torpor - two give a \"nod\" to minorities, one is terrifyingly without experience, and yet America is giving them all a pass. Trump is the idol of all angry white male Americans, carrying their sloshing buckets of masculine toxicity and resentment from a previous century. Still we have never had a woman president. \n\nAmerica is being stultified by white male dominance.

Civilization has progressed as mind education has progressed and as brain education has remained as stagnant as ever our animal nature has remained as messed up as ever.\n\nOur sages rightly figured out that wisdom was the panacea for a thriving world. As wisdom remained fuzzy our experts jumped to emotional intelligence. EI and wisdom are the same entity and so EI also does not work. Now the latest trend is to change the mindset to improve society. The mind is a reflection of the brain and how do you change a reflection? By changing the brain!\n\nOur leaders and experts need to wake up to the fact that the mind and brain are two separate entities and you cannot educate the mind to fix the brain. The brain has to be healed directly. \n\nWisdom above all is love and just as love is an emotion so is wisdom. Wisdom is an emotion that springs from an emotionally healthy brain. In fact wisdom springs from emotional health (EH). Wisdom is EH. \n\nWisdom/EH is the foundation of health, education and society and yet as long as there is no testing and no manual for EH the world will remain decadent. \n\nI am an activist for EH and have a simple formula, Wisdom 3.0 for creating a thriving world through EH. \n\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@sajidalikhan2/wisdom-3-0-b6e03324e64a\" target=\"_blank\">https://medium.com/@sajidalikhan2/wisdom-3-0-b6e03324e64a</a>\n\nOur leaders and experts need to focus on EH and brain education.",

Let's look at Trump as an example.  Constant lying fulfills a need for the unfathomable when the truth is unacceptable. In effect, the lies have a convincing stimulation that replaces a sense of reality, fact, and truth.  This leads to this, \"Do you want the truth or just a good lie?\"  The answer for many is, \"a good lie.\"  \n\nLet's look at this campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"  Every nation on the planet has used this decadent statement expressing that we need something better than what we have.

It needs a rewrite. \n\nAnd finally, the word \"revolution\" as used here is a caricature entirely glossing over the foundational distinction between street protests and true social movements.\n\nIgnoring that the religion today is private profits, self-enrichment, shareholders' returns, and social unaccountability, the author then wonders about how people today hold on to whatever job -- or jobs -- they have than they did before. Or why they travel less than before.   \n\nFrom this he suggests we are more \"stable' in our decadence than we might know.\n\nI could not disagree more.

All of the examples he gives of failed business strategies have nothing to do with morality or culture. It's true that technological advances have stagnated, but perhaps the reason we do not see many significant advances in quality of life has more to do with other driving forces like the unequal distribution of wealth that drives terrorism and in turn requires greater amounts of money spent on a military that contributes nothing to enriching our lives. And perhaps misguided tax cutting schemes like the one the Republicans passed under Trump have taken resources that could have been used to spur innovation and instead have lined the pockets of Wall Street types who always lobby for more \"economic freedom\" to feast off the rest of society. Or perhaps it is unregulated capitalism that drives people to seek unattainable greater economic growth no matter how damaging it may be to our society and the Earth. \n\nDouthat is really talking a bout a sense of ennui facing modern man. With the Internet bringing into our living rooms   daily images of the lives of the rich and the famous, we are always feeling inadequate. We can't really appreciate the lives we have. There is no sense of sacrifice, only a sense of wanting more and more. This has led to the dead end that is Trump.",

Despite rhetoric to the contrary, the educated/professional class does not want to turn the keys over to the people of America.\n\nWe've just seen in Iowa how the democratic party and mainstream media uses trickery (like internally preset State Delegate Equivalents) to promote party-insider candidates within the party and for the entire country - in one of its many CLOSED caucuses and primaries of their nomination process (a point avoided by this paper).\n\nThe truth is, most Democrats today (including most readers here) do NOT want most Americans (who are mainly Independent and non-affililiated and are socially conservative and economically liberal) to vote or have any influence over their country. They don't respect democracy; they just PRETEND to.\n\nThis is where alternative, online news and other information sources can expose this pretense and force the professional class to promote democracy. IMO, this pretense must GO in order for our country to make major changes it now needs to make, in terms of economic justice and environmental sustainability.",

Now most Americans don't read one book a year, much less support art, music or performing arts in their community.

The resulting improvement in people's lives all over the globe will be spectacular, not just in connection to climate change, but in terms of reductions in air and water pollution across the board, as well as other impacts, such as declining dependence on certain regions of the world for fossil fuel.  And once initial capital outlays have been made, costs of energy production will approach net zero.  \n\nI don't think anyone can fully grasp, at this point, what the social implications of this will be, since are approaching an epoch as transformative as the industrial revolution itself.

His examples are of people who were so enamored of material success, but without the ethical guardrails that religion can provide, that they entered into cynical bargains at the cost of their \"souls\". It is hard for me, having read Douthat's columns, to imagine what other solution he might offer to this \"decadence\" (which he bends over backwards to argue isn't really a \"bad\" thing- just a fact- but his denials don't ring true).\n\nThe problem is- religion, while offering ethical and moral norms, is regressive and reactionary and not really compatible with full material progress. I don't, therefore, see it as an alternative to materialism i.e. improvements in the quality of the life we are actually living. So maybe there is no answer except for society to move slowly along the road of technical, medical, cultural etc. progress to improve the lives of everyone and everyone will have to figure out the \"spiritual\", and ethical and moral, dimension for themselves- if they can. Humans should take what they can get and not expect to be granted everything they want.",

That is apparent as a rising standard of living makes our existence more about the self than the community. We are not on the proverbial edge of  survival every waking moment of our  modern lives.\n\nYet  for  hundreds of millions that is  still the  very case but technology can and does insulate us from that and it has also fostered an ever growing state of insincere empathy.\n\nThis reveals its self when one can just click on a  petition to  voice their objection to the treatment of Syrian refugees, then the next moment jump to your IG of FB feed to like a dozen posts.\n\nDecadency promotes the paradox of duality of  self and enables ignorance and narcissism, as well as complacency toward obvious human suffering.\n\nDecadence is the  great pacifier, but  again that is what  human always nature seeks.

This work of fiction by Evelyn Waugh concerns the last decay of a fictional English noble family and more broadly, society's transition into what's portrayed as a dreary modernity.  \n\nAs the neocons identified with empire and aristocracy in Brideshead, so Mr. Douthat seems to identify with the rugged progress of the Industrial Age and the Computer Revolution in the 20th century. By comparison, he finds the current century wanting. \n\nMr. Douthat ought to consider that it's really too soon to know what advances will result from the ability of any human with Internet service to instantly access any piece of knowledge  and communicate with any other human. #Printing Press x 1000.\n\nLastly when Mr. Douthat mentions: \"anti-establishment forces that are unprepared to competently govern\" he indulges in the kind of unsubstantiated swipe against progressives that seems to be obligatory for conservatives these days. Why? Because in doing so he carries out his real program, the one which pays the bills, namely blind support of the \"establishment\" regardless of cost. What could be more decadent than that?",

They need authorities who tell them what it's safe to think.\n\nIn their fear, often sublimated and unacknowledged, they're not content to find security in their own adherence to a set of beliefs; they must impose their beliefs on others, because the mere visibility of different beliefs and behaviors threatens their illusion of security.\n\n2. Open-minded people humble enough to acknowledge their own limitations but not paralyzed by the awareness of those limits. \n\nThey respond to that awareness by seeking more knowledge.

First, our decadence is fueled by commercial self -interest and enabled by a hitherto unimaginably subtle but intrusive media. It started with 'you are worth it\" ads and now permeates every aspect of our lives through social media, infomercials, and advice on how we can stay young and have \"fun\".Second, the quest for youth has had uniquely damaging effects on parenting and lifestyle choices as idiocies like \"age is just a number\" take hold. Aspiring to feel or look young is conflated with infantilism seen in the need for instant gratification, entitlement, and blame without accountability. Finally, the ultimate decadence, the mantra about pursuing one's passions in life without regard to whether these are supported by talent or have the potential to lead to economic or social independence. It is no coincidence that so many observe stagnation since the 1960s when the US was no longer the \"only game in town\" and had to compete globally while the culture failed to evolve and adapt to a world where education, knowledge and skills matter more than passion or effort.",

The beautifully equipped second, third and fourth homes filled with marble, steel, glass and precious woods, that are inhabited a few weeks a year and then redone when sold or fashion changes. The monthly first-class or private travel to far-flung places, staying in accommodations designed with many of the same scarce resources.  \n\nThese days, people don\u2019t go into business to help people or improve the planet \u2014 they want to become rich.

Just what is it that humanity needs to do to make the value of lives lived normally, valuable and fulfilling? \n\nI\u2019m 77 and have led a rewarding and fulfilling life.

As I look back across the last two centuries and compare them to the last two decades I feel lucky to be alive today. I generally don\u2019t worry about the excessive discrimination and intolerance of say 1800-1975, or least take comfort in knowing that people of color, sexual orientations other than mine, and women in general have much more opportunity than they did in prior epochs. I also take comfort in knowing that when I get ill there is typically a treatment or even a cure for what ails me. I also enjoy the catalogue of human existence that is available typically in a moments notice, to enjoy all the artwork ever created, all the music ever played, all the plays, movies and shows ever made; and the catalogue continues to grow and will likely never be left behind. Our times, which may seem decadent to some,  are not: They are vibrant and rich beyond measure; roughly 7-8% of everyone that has ever lived are alive today and these overwhelming numbers, while creating new issues never before dealt with by humanity, will continue to generate a Renaissance never seen before by humanity either.",

Of course, this is exactly what has happened in the 21st century, as described in Mr. Douthat's examples.\n\nMany of the great technological developments of the 20th century that benefited the general public were originally funded by government and academic research, which reflected the public interest. That world is now largely gone, to our great detriment. We are now paying the price.",

According to Mr. Douthat, the problem is a cobbled-together, hypotheticals-supported, lighter-than-air grand myth called \"The Age of Decadence.\"\nIs is a sad commentary that the Times would afford so much space to an old fashioned conservative propaganda piece that twists like a pretzel to draw attention away from what has really been happening in America, and  that instead points a would-be shaming finger at all of us while ignoring realities that have truly put our democracy in such dire straights.\nAt least when William Safire fed us this kind of baloney he did it in 800 words and made us smile even if we weren't willing to swallow what he was offering.",

And, as my grandmother used to quip, the children are \"suffering from too much.\" Well, there's not much to do about it, except to get poor and humble once again, but nobody seems to be calling for another Great Depression to rid the country of some of its elitism.\n\nIn the case of declining birth rates, that's truly a double-edged sword. If that phenomenon was occurring proportionately across every country globally, that would be a good thing, indeed. The planet cannot support 7 billion people, which is the root cause of global warming. On the other hand, since declining birth rates are selectively occurring in wealthier countries, which is a natural phenomenon, that causes internal issues. There is an eroding economic base to support the social support systems of the older citizens. (Social Security was in debt from Day One, so this isn't new, only getting worse.) And, as you say, innovation stagnates.\n\nOf course, the fix is \"Open the doors. Open them wide.\" Immigration has always rejuvenated our culture of innovation, hence, our economy. Somehow, a very large proportion of the US population has become to believe that immigration is destructive, rather than accretive. Ross, perhaps you need to develop a road show for your upcoming book, whereby the basic concepts can easily be understood by all, thus enabling an alteration of immigration paradigms.",

It's a result of disastrous economic choices made by both political parties.\n\nMany Americans can't afford to move for jobs elsewhere. Jobs are often in parts of the country where the well-to-do have priced lower-income wage earners out of the housing market. Jobs often don't pay enough, have no retirement plans or medical benefits. Lack of financial stability and income also means fewer marriages and children. And blocking immigration guarantees a lower US birthrate. Nor is the opioid epidemic really about lotus-eating dreamers; it's about corporate-medical malfeasance, economic and spiritual despair.\n\nI don't buy Mr. Douthat's sociological-cultural theories, tropes and memes of cultural and political \"stagnation\" that at least in the US have clearer causes. \n\nReality? People work to \"pass\" as middle class. Fewer belong to the comfortable middle class Douthat claims definitive of the country. Too many work in the gig economy and will never retire; many lose 30-50% of their pay to rent--if they're not already living in their cars or tents with little over for food and medical bills. There are more concrete causes and solutions to our problems than theories about stagnation and decadence. \n\nTo tweak what Bill Clinton once said, It's politics and the economy, stupid.",

Hidden in Douthat\u2019s verbal haystack is another opportunity for him to blame both sides for our predicament, and to take the spotlight off of the Republicans and his own conservative tribe.\n\nBut, at its heart, Douthat\u2019s spasm of verbiage is yet another pitch for classical conservatism which promotes social \u201cstability\u201d at all costs over revolution.  It\u2019s Edmund Burke versus Thomas Paine. (Gee Ross, you could have said that in two sentences.)\n\nAnd to achieve that stability, Douthat provides us with a glimpse into how the conservative mind works, how it sees what it wants to see with the help of a little factual manipulation and perceptual legerdemain. \n\nDouthat tries to convince us that our \u201cstagnation\u201d isn\u2019t a bad thing, but is, in fact, a healthy sign of social \u201cbalance\u201d or stability \u2013 the conservative Holy Grail. In other words, maybe Trump isn\u2019t so bad. After all, the socialists like Sanders are storming the walls, and so Trump and the socialists balance each other out.  There \u2013 don\u2019t you feel better? Some will be rich and some will be poor \u2013 it\u2019s the natural order (balance).\n\nThe key here is to convince yourself that a comfortable balance \u2013 i.e. stability \u2013 actually exists.  So, cherry pick a few economic statistics and grab a few lines from a couple of books, throw in a little faith and hope, and \u2013 voila! \u2013 crisis is gone, and in its place is a shimmering mirage of stability. \n\nAin\u2019t fantasy great?",

They become susceptible to scapegoating and simplification of reality, and ultimately become incapable of thinking critically about seductive blandishments of demagogues, starting with Reagan (i.e., \"government is the problem\") and reaching a nadir with Trump.\n\nI believe that Republicans' motivation for pursuing this program (maybe unconsciously, for some individuals) is preservation of power, plus regaining a simpler, happier (and mythical) past society. This harks back to the desire of some Southerners to regain the power they lost when they lost the Civil War. (Nixon appears to me to have exploited this with his \"southern strategy\").\n\nIt will be difficult, possibly impossible, for us to reverse our slide towards autocracy.

In my view, the support of unfettered capitalism coupled with \"corporate personhood\", passionately supported by the conservative movement by the way, has brought us the stagnation you clearly defined.  I agree that we are in a period of stagnation.  The investor class is not where creativity comes from but rather from the ground up.  When America stopped investing in its people over 30 years ago, it took this long for stagnation to take root.  Just as our economic policies produce monopolies, the veneer of those monopolies makes it look like we are still a \"free enterprise\" society when we are clearly not.  Producing corporate behemoths and a smattering of billionaires will not serve a representative republic well in the long run.  It will destroy any hope of a dynamic society.",

Sadly, protecting nature is viewed as a political issue when it is truly one of survival of our species.

The Eastern Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire) lasted 1000 years.\nIf our society is suffering from decadence, it arises from the economic inequality between the 1% and the rest of us. And the decadence is rampant in the 1%. The rest of us are just trying to keep our heads above water. If there is stagnation, it is because the 1% are satisfied with the status quo. The answer to economic stagnation comes either through violent upheaval (think French Revolution) or political revolution (think election of FDR). Although I am no fan Trump, I can posit that 2016 was a political revolution.\nFinally, in a mature society, the pace of innovation and invention will eventually slow because the easy things are always overcome first. The best example is in health care. A medical researcher once was asked why progress was so slow in finding a cure for cancer. The answer was very simple. The many diseases we have cured up to this point were easy to find solutions for. Now we are faced with the hard ones such as Cancer. The solutions will take more time.\nThere is no decadence in true innovation and invention (which is not such things as social media and internet shopping), but the recognition that there are limitations in the laws of physics and science. \nWorking class people would not describe their lives as decadent but more likely a feeling of being stifled.",

Are we in a period of decadence or in a period of steady-state? Since the industrial era began, economics, the sciences, politics, virtually every endeavor has labored under a growth scenario. This is founded on the principle that the pie will continue to grow so that everyone's slice gets bigger. It seems that we have now arrived at a steady-state, or nearly so. The pie no longer is growing, just the size of the slices are changing - the pie's distribution.\n\nAs Mr. Douthat acknowledges, there is little that is new but a lot that is recycled. Movies do not necessarily reflect our times; however, cinema, as a genre, does. We see the rise and fall of disaster movies; then we have the environmental disaster genre, and recently, we've had the Super-Hero genre with the rise of Marvel and DC. But throughout this time, we have seen more and more sequels and sequels packaged as 'prequels.' Nothing more than recycling original ideas. \n\nOur GDP has remained at around 2% to 3% for the last 20 or so years; in the period leading up to this, we experienced growth rates from 4% to as high as 15% - 19% (admittedly, during WWII), floating around 5% - 8%.\n\nIn short, we are not in a state of decadence, we are simply entering steady-state that suggests we're in it for the long haul.

One would hope that Green parties everywhere would become relevant -and not just in Germany-and that Ms. Thuneberg is a harbinger of an activist, committed you. The inequality crisis is threatening democracy itself, and again one would hope that  the socialists would re-group and remember what was their raison d'etre: to help the poor and working class rise. If something does not wake up the West, the 1920's maybe the parallel to the 2020's, and just as the awful 1930's followed the 20's, an awful 2030's may follow our decade. It would be a tragedy if Orwellian China  and environmental chaos was the future of humanity: the West must wake up to avoid it.",

Materialism is indeed a philosophy that has no faith in the ultimate goodness of the universe.  The Epicureans of the Roman Empire sought private comfort in a world without vision or hope.  I suspect Ross thinks that's the real source of our decadence and that the solution is a return to Thomas Aquinas.   He's wrong about that.

My issue, Mr. Douthat, is that your thesis encapsulates your placement on the political spectrum; for those to your left (or for those who are less dour), it is a retrenchment rather than a revelation.  For example, your internet stories may be sordid but are neither exceptional nor are any more emblematic of America now than equivalent behavior of other eras (one need only watch the \u2018American Greed\u2019 series to appreciate that McFarland, Holmes, Kalanick, etc. \u2013 many of whom have had dedicated episodes \u2013 are no different than their low-life counterparts of the past.) The mechanics and components of the scams differ but the invidious perversity of individual behavior does not, regardless of the nature of the overlying, contemporaneous society. Your examples prove nothing. But my fundamental problem with all articles proclaiming the nature of the concurrent age \u2013 so often accompanied, when the author is conservative, by declarations of moral decrepitude and patent decadence (applying both the popular and aesthetic definition of that word) \u2013 is that it is impossible to declare such a status from within that extant society. It\u2019s simply a guess informed by one\u2019s biases. From North Carolina it seems to me the most essential and disturbing question is: Why do the people between the coasts revere the man in the White House, the most egregious and pernicious example of decadence and moral degeneracy our nation has ever known?",

Consumers are stuck in a battle of diminishing marginal utility as they strive for more and more stuff that gives them less and less pleasure.\n\nMeanwhile, great problems and great opportunities fester.  We spend nearly one-fifth of GDP on health care wildly enriching a thin section of those employed in that pursuit while substantial portions of the general population procrastinate about needed care because of the cost.  We enable and reward rent-seeking in health care at the expense of the health of the populace.\n\nThe planet warms and the effects of that warming can be found in bleached coral reefs and starving polar bears, in shrinking ice sheets and raging wild fires.  There is a broad avenue to serious innovation but it is blocked by interests entrenched in mining coal and drilling for oil and piping natural gas.  And they have enough money to buy the legislation and the policies that maintain the status quo.\n\nThe future begs for nothing more than honest leadership and an educated populace interested in more than Jack's Facebook page and Jill's antics on Instagram.  \n\nWe have met the enemy and he is us.",

When you save the world from fascism it's pretty difficult not to walk away from that with a lot of pride, and that goeth before the fall.\n\nHowever I grew up with a lot of optimism about the U.S. and Western Civilization, and have been optimistic about it for most of my life. For example I don't see Europe declining yet, in fact I see an incredible belief in the future there, and an understanding that we must rise up to the challenges of our time and fundamentally rewrite the rules of our society and capitalism if we want to continue to grow.\n\nWhat I see in the U.S. is moral decline, political corruption, kakistocracy, and a 'vast right wing conspiracy' that is trying to make the rest of us live out some Ayn Rand dystopia, out of some kind of irrational fear that we are headed for a Brave New World. They are doing this because they cannot let go of their pride, that we are somehow a better people than the rest of the world.  We are not, and because of their influence, we are quickly becoming worse. And I fear they are really doing it because they are nothing more than a cynical oligarchy consolidating their power.\n\nIf we had read the current news back in 1990, we would have assumed we were reading about a backwater banana republic. We need to pull out of the current tailspin before we can solve this decline.",

In the case of national or global \"decadence\" I suggest Mr. Douthat and many others are significantly misaligned.\n\nPut aside Pinker and all the evidence for long term human improvement.  Have we really stagnated since 1970?  Stop and compare any aspect of life in the US then and now, and not just things that might seem decadently frivolous.  Medicine and health care has probably changed as much in the past 50 years as in any period before, in the science, technology, delivery, and outcomes.  We are in the midst of a revolution in energy production, distribution, and delivery.  Food production continues to innovate and improve, from the mega scale to the boutique heirloom level.  Manufacturing looks nothing like it did 20 years ago, let alone 50, and produces better stuff at lower cost--and still employs millions of people.\n\nWhy are our perceptions so misaligned, especially in the chattering classes?  Maybe because too many Americans are disconnected from that physical achievement.  How many people are not scientists, engineers, medical professionals, farmers, technicians, etc.?  And even among these, how many have decades of experience that let them appreciate change?  Finally, how many of us want to see every issue as dire (perhaps reflecting our broad lack of actual understanding and potential skills to address challenges).",

The digital world is helping keep us on those couches, providing us some nourishing intellectual food, but only those who seek it out.  The rest of us are living on entertaining junk, the mental equivalent of brightly colored candy.  And of course we are innovating like crazy, but what uses are we putting that innovation to?  AI so our smartphone can get us to buy more shiny things?\n\nIt may be that we will only respond when the dangers actually arrive.

Climate change definitely fits into this same mold for most liberals.  \n\nJune 2017 edition of the journal Environment and Behavior \u201cGood Intents, but Low Impacts...results show that individuals with high pro-environmental self-identity intend to behave in an ecologically responsible way, but they typically emphasize actions that have relatively small ecological benefits.\u201d  So liberal executive that I know in the USA buys a Prius to be carbon efficient but takes a high paying job on the other side of the city doubling her commute from their 2,500 sq ft townhouse with thermostat always set to 75 degrees (summer or winter). \n\nSupport nuclear power.  A solution that with improved safety could quickly help the US lower their carbon print.  France is able to generate 50% of their power.  Out of the Democratic candidates (including former) only Booker and Yang were in favor of nuclear power. \n\nSo if you want conservatives to take climate change as a real and a presnt danger, push for more than the political blame game (smells of political opportunism) but for instituting policies and individual behavior that supports reducing carbon emissions in serious way.",

What could start out looking like a new Baader-Meinhof or a collection of Timothy McVeighs could turn into Grant vs. Lee if Fox News sees an angle. It is no pantomime when gun rights advocates go wandering around State Houses wearing riot gear and carrying assault rifles.\n\nSecondly as mentioned in many other comments, climate change is real and it is serious. 4 more years of Trump will be catastrophic and not simply 8 total years lost but more like a force multiplier of 25, 50 years. Rewriting rules, undoing Trump, battling in courts - that\u2019s something that will hamstring the next few presidents depending on the make up of congress. What\u2019s more, we should be leaders on mitigating climate change and instead we are in a race for 1st place as the most destructive. As a species, we are stone cold killers. First we killed off the megafauna, now we are working our way down the list to kill the little guys. Every huge SUV purchased might as well come with ad showing it plowing over koalas, eagles, manatees and a countless other species. There is nothing decadent about full-scale, fossil-fueled animal genocide.",

Especially when it is abundantly clear the marijuana or hemp oil have clear positive health and healing effects but while legal in more and more states is not covered by health insurance.

It would be like the authority of a parent if, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; but it seeks, on the contrary, to keep them in perpetual childhood: it is well content that the people should rejoice, provided they think of nothing but rejoicing. ....",

As other comments state, this opinion doesn't mention climate change or human migration in terms of survival.

It also doesn't discuss the potential for large scale war, intense pandemics or of society altering philosophies that change how we view ourselves, our governing principles, our technology, and our global family in a positive way.  When viewed through a historical pane, all that we are experiencing is just part of a cycle that humanity plays out throughout the centuries.  Perhaps we go through this period of stagnation only to plant the seeds that will evolve into a new future.  We could come to the beginning of 22nd century and find that the world is a very different place as a result of renewal that occurs at some point during the next 80 years.

However, when it comes to technology and economics, I find Douthat's examples selective and easily counter-argued. Yes, Theranos was a fraud, but there are 19 other healthcare unicorns out there. Much of Uber's lack of profits can be attributed to rider subsidies, not an inherent lack of profitability in its business model. It took Amazon nine years to become profitable, most of which today comes from AWS, not its core business. Using the Peter Thiel quote about the lack of flying cars while also bemoaning Uber is ironic, given that Uber itself is developing flying taxis, which it plans to launch in 2023. For a measure of disruption, look no further than the average tenure of companies on the S&P 500, which has shrunk from 33 years in 1964 to 24 years in 2016 to a projected 12 years by 2027. The advent of artificial intelligence/machine learning and blockchain are arguably as seismic and consequential as the internet itself. I could go on. What it tells me is that you have someone whose political and social incisiveness isn't matched in the economic and technological realms. Douthat could be right, but the evidence isn't convincing. A couple trips to VCs in Silicon Valley and a couple papers by leading economists selectively chosen to fit the thesis makes for a superficial versus a substantive case.",

An exciting time for a kid in the 50s & 60s. Many were excited about the future and how we may make great discoveries. Our hobbies, yes we all had hobbies, showed us our potential and the joy & satisfaction of discovery. Many of us could not wait to get our engineering or science degrees, to be in Mission Control with the pocket protector or the designer of wondrous things. We started our careers believing that we would make a difference, and we did.\n\nI see less of that passion for discovery in younger employees-it is more a job than a career. Management is more concerned with schedules and budgets than innovation that costs money and may not pan out. Quarterly expectation of increased profits drives out risk taking and innovation. Technologies that make our society function, minerals, metals, manufacturing, etc. are undervalued and not \"sexy\" careers for young people. Instead, the latest app, phone, or game substitutes to a need to satisfy natural curiosity and desire to learn & contribute (e.g., \"My contribution to society today is 130 Tweets. What's yours today?\") \n\nWe are missing much of the excitement of discovery. Where is the passion? What are we doing wrong? Where is the leadership to inspire today's kids as I was inspired by JFKs challenge to \"go to the moon by the end of the decade\"? Why are out \"leaders\" naysayers about science?",

Second - much of our scientific and social progress over the last 150 years was spurred by government subsidies (direct and indirect).  Examples range from land grants to companies building railroads to tax write offs  Third - too much of our so-called science consists of compiling and regurgitating studies done by others, rather than by original research.  Examples range from land grants to companies building railroads to tax benefits linked to hard research and development.  Suggestion - instead of re-defining history using conjecture ala Alexis de Tocqueville, why not test theories - the one I would suggest is testing whether the Republican tax cuts during the Reagan, W Bush, and Trump years siphoned money into financial schemes benefiting a few individuals rather than stimulating infrastructure and innovation that benefit economic and social development for the many.  We need to build alternatives to 20th century transportation modes and develop real medicines that reach beyond repackaging old drugs into new patents in order to raise prices.",

The individual in today's Western society is stuck with a controlling political movement - Conservatism - that resists reality, refuses to adapt, and exists only to make the already wealthy even more wealthy. Like dragons sitting on a pile of gold, conservative capitalism piles up wealth without larger purposes - it's unsustainable. Why should individuals hoard cash (Forbes list of billionaires) while Americans go hungry? Why should we continue to subsidize fossil fuel corporations in today's world of climate change? Why does the DOD budget have to be so large when we can't have health care and education? Why would we pull out of the Paris Agreement, setting ourselves apart from the world community? Looking for decadence? Don't point at the fish, look to those ruling elite who keep the aquarium water dirty. Before lecturing the rest of us on a popular crisis of Decadence, Douthat should take a step back and look objectively at his own core assumptions based in Conservatism and Catholicism - there you will find the roots of Decadence.

It's not there.\n\nIt's absence is peculiar for two reasons. First, if you accept Ross's thesis, the climate crisis has to be right up there among the challenges our \"decadent\" civilization is not facing. \n\nSecond, if there's a challenge that can shake us out of our moral and spiritual torpor, the climate crisis is it.\n\nWe don't need another world war to wake us from our slumbers. We don't need to fly to Mars to rediscover virtue. We just need to face this existential challenge that's staring us in the face. If the nations of the West can't do that, then maybe we deserve to go the way of the Roman Empire. \n\nWhat I think is more likely, though, is that we will -- eventually -- confront it. And when we do, we will discover that the only workable solution is to build a civilization that's wise, just, and sustainable. Not necessarily the \"Green New Deal,\" but something in that spirit.\n\nThat effort is going to change everything. And it's not going to take 400 years. We don't have that much time. \n\nSo, if it feels like the end of an era, that's because it is. We either build a wise, just, and sustainable civilization or we fall. \n\nEither way, this era of \"decadence\" will soon be over.",

I've lived long enough and have seen enough history to know movements come and go and I'm not sure our current reality is even a movement.  One of the major problems contributing to today's disappointments is that people expect instant gratification.  If you are sick, there is a pill for it. If you own stocks, you expect instant dividends (No, no, no, don't put money back into development!). If you are working on a computer, it is too slow (forgetting that it is hundreds of time faster than it used to be). Another major problem is that people who haven't lived the history haven't learned enough about it. Most of today's population have no real idea about people trying to scale the Berlin Wall to escape communism or about the USSR's extreme measures to put down the protests in Hungary.  I saw it on live TV.  I agree with much of what you say about our perceived views of college campuses and individuals who believe internet conspiracy theories.  They are a very small percentage of the population but they get outsized publicity because they are a \"man bites dog\" story. Our institutions might be flawed but are the only things keeping our world together.  We need to take a deep breath and work to fulfill the promises of our institutions.",

We are at the end of a cycle just as we were in 1969 and just as we were in the early 19th century when the Know-Nothing Party rose and the Whigs disappeared, at the end of the first Industrial Revolution. A new K-wave wipes the slate clean. In 1969 practical and affordable computers were almost a reality and the wave that started in the early 1970s carried us to today. That wave is toast. The new wave forming is plainly visible and it involves sustainability in all its forms including renewable energy and carbon absorption. The new wave is being resisted big time by the entrenched energy interests and the politicians who enable them.

You can google anything at any time and greatly expand your know how and know what. That is of course about increased intelligence, not necessarily greater wisdom.

However no mention of the fundamental change in American work since the 1970\u2019s is a major flaw in this thesis, especially considering his issues with vaporware foisted by our tech economy. Everything that characterizes the new decadence comes after a major structural shift wherein the things we made are no longer made here and those who made them were forgotten by our community. Those things that are still made here are more expensive and lower quality than those made elsewhere and those Americans that continue to make have less security, promise of advancement, and live in areas more rife with crime. And debt. Those of us not in the top percent of earners are ensnared by debts. We currently collectively owe $14 trillion dollars and live under a system that makes every macro-economic effort to ensure that our debts are not inflated away.

It particularly depresses me what language is becoming in the 21st century: It's not so much to enlighten but to advertise, insidiously persuade, become a mesh/barrage/impenetrable barrier of legal/business jargon, and anyone who thinks and writes clearly appears to be coopted to do the reverse to point of even writing cryptic sentences, as if the eventual project by power is not so much to make people illiterate but develop a language the majority of people cannot decipher.\n\nIt's all about surveillance, codes, ciphers, complex mathematics, propaganda, correct speech, complex and confusing procedures to make virtually everything as impenetrable as possible.

I agree that decadence is at the root of America's multitude of political, cultural and economic problems. But I do agree with one commenter that your next column should be about solutions--and it would be interesting  to engage your fellow opinion writers with their reactions and solutions. In my opinion, our stagnation will not be solved (or improved) with either Trump or Sanders. In fact, a new president might move us in a better direction but it will not begin to solve the problems created by our decadence without a wholesale shift in the perspective of the American people. Unfortunately, we lost the best opportunity to foster this shift in 2008 when Bush and Obama decided to bailout the banks for their malfeasance. This decision fostered the decadence that you describe and prevented the American people from experiencing the pain of unregulated capitalism. There is certain to be another opportunity and it may be impossible at that time to prevent the pain. Of course, if we had real policymakers in office we'd have honest debates about the issues that have caused the decadence and the political leaders would permit votes on important legislation. But since decadence permeates our three branches of government it  is likely that their stagnation will continue until a catastrophe strikes.",

Freud said also that civilization requires the suppression and sublimation of our human instincts. This is the source of our dehumanization, the root of the author's definition of decadence.

First, we have a system overwhelmed with the the end effects of gluttony: morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, vascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis. These are chronic diseases of a society that just doesn't care about health responsibility on an individual level. Second, that same medical system throws endless amounts of money at these same problems in an inefficient and greed-driven way. Where else in the world does everyone get a CT scan for abdominal pain in the ER? Where else are joint replacements a virtual walk-in service? Our individual ability to push our own poor health choices' costs onto society at large is a tragedy of the commons and decadence at its worst. Third, medical cures are limited by biology and chemistry. There are only so many receptors for drugs and so many surgical approaches for disease. There are real limitations to cures, despite the pie-in-the-sky hope for genetic and micro-robotic treatments for everyone. Chemistry and shear cost will forever prohibit the use of esoteric treatments in the general population. Thus, there is an asymptotic limit to any treatment's success rate. Breast cancer is a perfect example.  More women are diagnosed with mammograms, ultrasounds, and MRIs, but guess what? Mortality rate hasn't budged. Decadence indeed, no matter how many trillions of dollars we spend on \"healthcare\" in this country.",

Our dissatisfaction with the political system is to vote out incumbents after they have demonstrated total failure in making the most needed changes promised.

Individuals still have the ability to rise above the swamp of social media to engage in learning and pursuit of their interests beyond formal education.

The conclusive opinion in the last Part brings readers to the very currently happening situation in politics.  No side yields for the other.  Besides, accepting the stagnation would be a difficult part especially for those whose lifetime careers have been built on and for it.

On the contrary, what is occurring there is rather dynamic. Exploitation is dynamic.\n\nSo it has been for years. Western Europe was not stagnant during the Age of Exploration. As well, when it ran over Africa last century. With nothing left to explore, all that remained was exploitation of the already discovered. Then growth, then wealth, then decadence, then stagnation.

Surely decadence means more than stagnation, or decay (the state of decadence?)\".  It has more of a sense of active moral choice - choosing to fritter away time and resources when one knows better.  And I would say in any objective sense, the 99% (or at least 50%) anywhere have a lot more on their mind than frittering about - just trying to get by in a stressed out, increasingly costly world on their precarious finances.  So this notion of a civilization just \"becoming\"  too weary to care, to innovate, to care for itself, just seems a bit vague.  So from the get go here - a red herring.  There are choices being made - the question is how, and by whom.\n\nSince we are tossing about older wisdom, a quote from de Tocqueville seems most apt.  In Democracy in American Vol 2 (1840) he wrote of how despotism might creep in to a democracy.  He was concerned about government, but the same warning could apply to businesses as well:\n (see next)",

In other words, what has characterized the human rise to civilization and move from civilization to civilization as collapse has occurred, what actually is development and health of civilization?\n\nThe easy answer would be increase of thought, creativity and profound coordination, discipline between people. Society becomes more complex, requires more thought, requires a greater and more subtle repertoire of action. Books become more complex, machines become more complex, music becomes more complex,--everything becomes more difficult to understand and put into operation.\n\nHistorically societies which are organized and led more effectively wage war more effectively and in their triumph and complexity perform effectively in other areas as well. Therefore we can expect the overcoming of decadence to be society aiming to become ever more complex as an organizational and thought system.\n\nThis is a positive for people with great natural intelligence and creativity and discipline/flexibility of action, but unpleasant for those without these qualities.

Stagnation is the case of Germany, where everything, literally every aspect of economic life has been put on hold since more than three decades. The German government, not the German people, made the decision to first bail out Eastern Germany, then to bail out Greece, and then to bail out Syria by means of allowing 2 million non-EU citizens in as refugees. You can build a shrine to the German government, but it won't take away the biting stagnation or the lack of democracy. In the US Trump creates shiny lies for all those in power who do not really identify with fellow Americans, so half of the American population really doesn't care at all for country or the truth. If Trump is reelected, then the people did chose Trump's bevaviour and policies, unlike the German people who were never asked. The West as a whole is not in decline or stagnation. Great progress has been made in the Benelux countries, in Spain. Open-mindedness and willingness to help others is far greater with the EU than with the Trump administration. And if living from the inside is the right way to go, the UK will be the golden future of the West, if and only if they can get rid of Boris Johnson the liar",

That revolution brought deregulation, de-unionization, privatization, and tax cuts for business and the wealthy with the promise of increased investment and broad-based prosperity. Instead, we got declining investment, increasingly concentrated wealth and the stagnation that now so troubles Mr. Douthat. We have continued on the same path--over and over again--with no political or economic vision except tax cuts and deregulation, which only exacerbates the social decay and decadence. But Mr. Douthat just skips over the most significant political--and, cultural--event that created our current state. It was the election of Ronald Reagan. Since Reagan--the original \"make America great again\" guy--we are locked into a present that looks to replay the past rather than face the changes and challenges of the future. \"Trump Digs Coal\" is a fit symbol of turning our backs on the future to resurrect the past. It is a meaningless slogan, that does nothing for those who dutifully cheer for it, but it is nonetheless a cultural wedge that divides our nation and is used politically to prevent any action on a wide range of economic and environmental issues. We are immobilized, unable to take action that will give us a future, and at the same time applauding those who brought us to this point--that is decadence.",

However one small quibble; quoting Robert Gordon on stagnation is fair but one should then also include a perspective of his Northwestern colleague, Joel Mokyr, who has a much more optimistic perspective on economic growth.  The (friendly) argument between their two perspectives is enlightening.",

Yes, Hollywood IS decadent but this does not extend to the art world as a whole. I don't think that there is anything decadent about the burst of creativity that followed the rise of a new format of movies: hours long quality movies split into segments of less than an hour. And as others have pointed out: Hello!? Climate Change!!? If we are to survive we will have to innovate and change the way we live in so many ultimately positive ways. I can see a future were cities strangled by huge traffic jams and intoxicated by toxic fumes will seem so ridiculous and backwards. We might not own cars anymore but cities could provide a service of electric self driving cars that would bring you to the closest hyperloop making transportation safer, faster and infinitely less polluting. And it's not limited to transportation. So many promises can come from integrating AI to agriculture: holistic, precision, vertical , whatever. This and many other domains where we could build a human world more respectful of the natural world and living alongside it in much better harmony. Forget startups built by college dropouts working from a garage. What about innovation by actual experts, scientists, university professors and PhDs? Stop clinging to the late 20th century model.

The writer is correct in his description of the decline in scientific breakthrough, however, he is incorrect in blaming it on decadence. In biomedical research, my field of science since the 1970\u2019s, current stagnation is simply the result of funding cuts, period. Public funding of biomedical research through the NIH started in the 1960\u2019s and was enormously successful in terms of returns on investments. President Clinton doubled the NIH funding in his second term in office to keep the momentum going. In 2003, at the end of the Clinton doubling, President Bush froze the NIH budget and took the wind out of the sail. Inflation adjusted support of biomedical research by the NIH is now at or below the level before the Clinton second term. Yes, decadence has set in, we have lost momentum, but not because we have become old and lazy. The culprit for the current stagnation in scientific breakthroughs is the loss of public, not-for-Profit, investment in research.",

Without these old unknowns both threatening and sheltering us, how does civilization define its goals?  Unable to expand, conquer, or colonize, why are we here?\n\nThe fragile response is to simulate what once was real--to imagine warring tribes, or to conquer land that is already thoroughly beat, once more boldly going where EVERYONE has gone before.\n\nBut the real answer is harder and more interesting.  We need to optimize and fine-tune our world-domination.  Unknowingly, we discovered how to make the Earth hot.  Now we need to figure out how to make it cold, too.  We mastered the claiming and clearing of territory for ourselves.  Now we need to figure out how to turn most of that territory into a supervised wilderness.\n\nReal challenges face us, and that's what has always made life exciting.",

And whatever decadent properties the Theranos and Uber stories evidence, do we know that they have become significantly more common in, say, the last three or four (or five or ten) years?",

Many periods of innovation were followed by periods in which new innovations took the time to take hold, develop, become more  sophisticated. The roaring twenties was a very decadent time in American history, and innovation only occurred afterwards because the US was faced with a Great slowdown of innovation, and Americans went on spending frenzies. Then we had Sputnik and the space race. Then we had the major breakthroughs with computers, the Internet (due to the search for better weaponry during the cold war), the cellphone, etc. Now is the typical time after  breakthroughs  with a lack of major innovation because these breakthroughs are being consolidated and built upon. Even climate change has not captured the imagination of Americans because it hasn't yet resulted in a huge crisis that galvanizes Americans to do something about it. The only area that is moving towards major innovation is biotech and biology, in order to find new ways to cure illness and increase longetivity. America will probably muddle through in other areas until another crisis comes along and Americans demand change and elect leaders that are willing to solve our health care problems. deal with climate change, alter the cost of colleges and technical training, create universal day care, etc. When will that happen? -- maybe too late...",

We invent more than ever (see number of patents by year) most inventions are just too complicated for most people to understand.

Yes, we invented cars in the last century, but this century we invented ways to make sure billions don't die of hunger. It takes constant, unseen innovation to stop a global Malthusian famine. Just because you don't understand how food is more productive now does not mean it is not ingenious. Moore's law is another example, processing power does not increase naturally, it takes work and innovation. We have invented plenty of revolutionary things recently, most people just don't understand them.\n\nAdditionally, of course the NYT dismisses the internet and social media as innovations. Social media is putting the NYT out of business. Ross and friends have a strong incentive to make their competition seem unoriginal and decadent, because if people accept new technology, Ross will be out of a job.",

I guess you do since you wrote it, but it's not. For one thing the current middle and working class is NOT more prosperous than in the previous (20th) century. And a great many Americans have still not recovered from the Great Recession. But you, and the rest of the intelligentsia remain oblivious, ensconced in your own very prosperous bubbles. \n\nYou might be right about our \"decadence\", but I would say it stems from one thing: the concentration of wealth and resources in the hands of a few. And since this small group controls much of the decisions about what things we invest in, their view is very small and incestuous. The great failing of \"supply side\" is that it starves the engine that drives growth. Even the feudal lords learned the hard lesson that if you impoverish the masses, eventually they can't contribute anything more. This applies to economics as well as innovation. \n\nI strongly suggest that you take a long road trip from the coasts, and actually see how REAL people live.",

There is less of a need to explore space, discover new methods of transportation, find newer ways to communicate and live better lives. Science's limits and the age of downsizing constrain human needs. For the moment, great discoveries and inventions have reached a plateau. There are some aspects of life, like health care, that will always require newer discoveries. But the potential for such discoveries is not able to keep pace with evolving needs. Hence, we reach a state of \"stagnation.\"\n\nBut the stagnation that Mr. Douthat describes does not necessarily portend a lackluster twenty-first century. Long-overdue social and economic justice are this century's necessities. Advances in materialism and attendant wealth accumulation should complement socio-economic equality. A sense of fairness rejuvenates the human spirit which in turn inspires the quest for greater innovation. The institutionalization of fairness in social and economic spheres of life will be as revolutionary as the materialistic discoveries of the past.",

Douthat seems to see it in those terms, noting the Apollo missions. Yet during that same time America was dropping napalm on the Vietnamese people. Civilization is good at building things/innovation, but what about the deeper struggles within the human heart? Google, social media, organized religion, political leaders, entrepreneurs offer little in those areas - they may even make it worse at times.  \n\nI've noticed many commentators have brought up global warming, an existential issue unlike anything modern civilization has ever faced (except maybe the nuclear issue). How do we change our way of thinking to benefit the many instead of the few? To paraphrase Eisenhower, every dollar spent on weapons means somebody will go hungry or they will not get medical treatment. Do we need a new terminology? New ways of thinking about education?

I have always thought of myself as sensibly politically correct -- racially and ethnically equal-minded, a feminist man, pro-choice, pro-union (though with some limits), strongly in favor of gun control, proper healthcare for all, the social net, the elimination of poverty, progressive taxation, american opportunity for all, etc. -- but now I find myself in arguments with my children over a number of views that I think are fair and not discriminatory, but that seem to outrage them, and in a work environment where one is made to feel one has to be insanely careful about every word one says.

Ditto the heyday of the Ottoman empire and various Chinese dynasties.  Oh sure, there were a lot of people, outstripping available resources at the time.  But science and technology of the last two centuries have ameliorated that situation, so that a population of billions can be sustained.\n\nWhat is unique now is that we are in what microbiologists refer to as a log phase of growth.  We are 7-8 billion, and will approach 10 very soon.  Let us assume that we can get up to 15-20 billion without starving.  Progrowth optimists additionally assume that technology will allow that number to grow arbitrarily higher, without limit, because, well, technology has always come up with something.\n\nBut even if technology constantly increases the number of people that can be housed and fed and made comfortable, with current practices, that many people will produce enough  CO2 and methane to inevitably warm this planet into a desert.  It won't matter whether we are \"decadent\" or not.\n\nWe have never been in this situation before, so comparison to history is futile.

However,  I wish that it explored more fully to what extent many of the negative trends it describes, e.g., declines in the establishment of new businesses and new scientific discoveries, are attributable to decadence as opposed to other factors.  To me, it seems that term 'decadence' typically implies a significant ethical or moral failing or weakness.  It is reasonable to argue that the negative trends described by the article do reflect some kind of ethical or moral decline in American society.  However, some of these trends could also be products of quite different causes.  For example, the declining numbers of new businesses could reflect a more difficult business environment than that seen in the 1970's.  The current power of online and national chain retailers might well make it much harder for a would-be entrepreneur to establish a new retail store than it was in the 1970's.  Similarly, there might be inherent scientific or technological barriers that limit the development of new innovations with the transformative power of the automobile or the airplane.  I don't dismiss the argument that a moral or spiritual decline may partially explain the issues discussed by Mr. Douthat.  However, I think that the article would be stronger if it also considered alternative explanations for the same trends, even if it rejected these explanations in the end.",

Kudos to NYT for providing the space for such serious minded pieces.  \n\nOne quibble.  If Obama fiddled with mediocre things, it was due in no small part to the united and incessant obstructionism of the GOP.  His proposed infrastructure spending in response to the financial crisis was reduced by some 75 or 80 percent by GOP obstructionists.  Any big ideas regarding green technologies were routinely ridiculed as pie in the sky; while Michelle Obama's modest pietistic campaign of better eating was met with a near hysterical opposition.\n\nReactionary politics, abetted by the right wing media, has been a positively harmful reality since Reagan.\n\nAmy Klobuchar is a refreshing antidote. Much of the ennui Douthat sees is the feigned cynicism of reactionaries who would rather stand on their grandmother's chest than pay taxes toward the common good.",

The alleged goal is to allow a few people to play with money in a contest to see who has the biggest pile. \n\nCuriously, a key provider of the financial means, tactics and goals are a few consulting companies, among them Bain (Romney) and Mackenzie (Buttigieg), who turn out what are allegedly our most dynamic, incorrupt politicians. Yet they are using the skills and knowledge provided by the most corrupting element of our society: financial fantasy games. \n\nFor centuries we had little actual knowledge and had to rely on speculation. Today, we have a knowledge base that can identify and address crucial societal and physical problems and address them effectively. To the extent we use this knowledge base at all, it seems to be more often to efficiently mislead. Ross is himself a misled victim when he treats planned population decline by having fewer children as a problem rather than a success story. \n\nIs what we are seeing today decadence or dispair?",

These were people without ideals, but bent on securing whatever they could for themselves and their friends.

The likes of Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Paul Ryan, Jim Jordan, and other right-wingers come from this generational group.  Their original hero and father-figure was Reagan.  They are quick to give Trump a pass because his values reflect theirs:  the supremacy of private property and the free market, business is where its at and that business-people are the object of society.  They double down on Evangelical religion, which reinforces capitalism.\n\nThey pride themselves on putting the country right, in contrast to what they see as dissolute baby-boomers.

There's the look of the 'very ambitious' to this, a vague resemblance to some of Joan Didion's old pieces in the New York Review of Books, but although worthwhile, is not nearly so sharp throughout.  But I write this comment because I think there are couple of inaccuracies that ought to be pointed out.\n\n1)  The farther you get from that iPhone glow, the clearer it becomes: Our civilization has entered into decadence.\n\nThat actually goes against most of what Douthat has written about the internet and the healthiness of getting away from it.  The farther away from the IPhone, you won't see more decadence than you did on that iPhone or your own degenerate addiction to it.  By now, I am often in clubs where I'm the only person without an iPhone, and having even lied about 'my iPhone', which I have never owned.  But you also see how to create from what's outside the iPhone, and that now even can include some specifically sexual creation.  This may have been, however, intended somewhat otherwise, but on the face of it, it does contradict much of what Douthat has said regarding internet addiction.  \n\n2) This seems more serious, but I have to make it as a separate comment or a reply to my own comment (this one), because the body got too long.",

The typical futuristic dream is of a sterile, nonnatural world where humans are stronger, smarter, with incredible powers, and one of the deepest fears and insults is that we might be insects or the like, a pest to be crushed underfoot.\n\nIt's hard to consider ourselves healthy when we have so much evidence of ourselves being contemptible, sick,--indeed our heroism is a perpetual search for health.",

The author's link to William Wilson's \"Replication Crisis\" was the best citation in a NYT op-ed article I've seen in years (and great to see after enduring the profound corruption of the Democratic party in Iowa AND this very newspaper.) The commodification of scientific research and the glossing over of negative results is greatly responsible for misguiding our paths in science and technology and many cultural movements based on these, IMO.\n\nWith regard to long-term robustness/sustainability (but probably not religion), modern American society could learn a lot from our Amish, Mennonite and other technology-cautious communities. The socioeconomic system of our capitalist country promotes large-scale agriculture and industry. It INHERENTLY increases the economic scale and level of production, which clearly is a bad thing for our ecosystem and our long-term (and often short-term) welfare.\n\nIMO, we may need to limit capitalism to help change our socioeconomic system to one that does not inherently ramp up the scale and level of commercial activity. A system favoring small-scales would promote long-term commercial activity, quality over quantity outputs and sustainable values added.",

There's no positive vision for a better tomorrow.  That bugs me.  I'm sure it bothers young people.  The best we can think of is no war and some solution to climate change.  That's ok but no where near inspiring enough for young people.",

Yes it's best and worst of times to quote a lesser Dickens novel.\n\nThe low-hanging fruit of science, tech, and medicine were picked in the first half of the 20th century. The world has been capitalizing ever since while the optimism of unlimited growth has waned. We admire strivers then become fixated on purveyors of vapor ware. (I'm a Prime Member to mention one you left out.) As you point out, gains increasingly accrue to the rentier class. So much of advanced economy is now founded on intellectual property but did we really have to grant protected status, e.g., to software that a 12-year-old could (and probably did) write releasing an army of one-click patent trolls?",

There are plenty of new ideas and plenty opportunities to build on existing real capital, but it entails taking on the supra-national titans holding the excess financial capital. We can create a better world for our people to live in as long as we have a genuine democracy. Unfortunately vested interests  stand in the way.

Businesses don't invest in new production or new ideas just because they have idle cash.  They do it because they see a market.  So what we need now is to give up on supply side economics and supply side stimulus, and instead, stimulate demand.  This means, massive income redistribution through tax cuts for the middle and working class, and massive public investments in public goods that benefit the not-rich directly.  Put money in THEIR pockets, and they spend it.  This creates demand, which creates an incentive for the rich to take their money out of their art collections and put it to use in the real economy.",

It's as if the drive that almost all humans naturally possess - that towards connection and unity and empathy and shared effort towards common causes - has been turned on its head, and we are instead beginning to each exist in our own discreet universe, where our personal beliefs and feelings and and whatever creature comforts we desire to indulge in are the only things that we allow to exist in our world. \n\nSome would blame technology for this, but I think cause and effect have run the other way. Our world of screens everywhere and same-day delivery of everything is a reflection of our desire to cut ourselves off, not the source of it. \n\nSomething appears to have shifted in the universe in a way that I fear we may not be capable of truly comprehending, but I for one think it's critical that we try, and so again I thank you for this thought-provoking piece.",

Many of these children are non-white, and/or from immigrant families, or otherwise from the underclass, and therefore not seen as worthy by our society.

Perhaps the reason that innovation seemed greater and more magnificent \"back then\", is that the stakes were higher; just staying alive was a more dubious proposition.  We now live longer and healthier, many fewer people fear hunger, disease, or being murdered.  Having solved those problems, perhaps we can take our time and work on solving less life-threatening problems.\n\nYou cherry picked three examples and linked them together to prove the decadence of our times (and I am not sure I would have included Uber).  There have always been charlatans:  e.g., Gregor MacGregor (1800s), who conned people to invest and settle in a fictitious kingdom, Victor Lustig (early 1900s), who sold money-printing machines AND the Eiffel Tower to a scrap firm.\n\nHere are some recent stories: Guy figures out how to connect computers so I can sit here and broadcast my opinion to the world.  Guy invents hand-held device that puts the knowledge of the world at everybody's fingertips.  Lady studying bacteria invents a way to correct genetic mutations. Detection of gravity waves.  Picture of black hole. Ebola vaccine.  Higgs Boson. Etc.\n\nI think you must be reaching the middle age bottom of your U-shaped happiness curve.

The \"return\" will be preservation of some semblance of our way of life.

Although, to be honest, I myself can't see the human race existing for more than another 1000 years, but what do I or you really know? However, what I do know is that our human race will or we won't be here. In the meantime, collect your salary and write your opinions.

In the old days there was a certain stewardship function we humans were supposed to exert over our planet, but our main duty was to 'progress' - to subdue and subjugate and - as the Bible says - have dominion over .... well, pretty much everything (plus being fruitful and multiplying, by the way.) But those notions are being supplanted in western thinking (wherever that is) as oppressive and destructive, and - definitely - not - sustainable. All of which kind-of makes sense, given how myopically we view human history. Seriously - it could well be that the last five thousand years of human progress are a minor and brief evolutionary experiment in adaptably highly-intelligent life.  So rather than living in decadence, maybe it's just that we have a different end-in-view in view; to wit, instead of getting ahead, we're trying to figure out how to get along  - not with each other, for heavens sake - but in achieving some systems-dynamics-like equilibrium avoidant of external disturbances where everything is kind of like it's always been, or at least not much just worse ....

Commenters have contended that there are fantastic discoveries and there have been some, particularly in astronomy and molecular biology. However in\nphysics, I perceive some stagnation: Sean Carroll commented recently in a NYTimes piece that few in the community are seriously committed to inquiry into the poorly understood foundations of quantum mechanics. Quantum field theory continues after almost 75 years to depend on a mathematical kluge called renormalization which allows one\n to ignore the fact that it predicts empirically finite quantities to be infinite.  The prediction of a multitude of 'supersymmetric' particles at the Large Hadron Collider in its most recent run (endorsed by essentially the entire theoretical community) was not confirmed.  Though they have come up empty for decades, searches for 'dark matter' particles continue though other explanations for the astronomical phenomena which inspired the idea exist. \nOf course the failure of many theoretical predictions is not unexpected and is part of the process. What is remarkable is the near unanimity of the community about these predictions.\nThere seems to be a kind of intellectually sheeplike mentality at work.  But the sociological, educational, political or economic reasons for that are not completely clear to me\nand space limitations do not permit elaboration of my speculations about them.",

While it's true that those with money have been pouring their wealth into whatever they think will be the next big tech boom, science funding continues to be cut.  The search for truth appears to be heavily discouraged: a newly-minted physics PhD has a near-zero chance of finding a middle-class existence practicing in her field; it's illegal to study the public health ramifications of gun violence; and, we all know how welcome the search for truth was in the Senate's impeachment trial, to name just a few examples.\n\nLegalize and embrace truth, and decadence will disappear.",

So I know in detail the Theranos story. \n\nI think the popular book Bad Blood is shamefully sensationalist, and misses the point. While funding science does give benefits, the way to encourage innovation is by funding those who bring technology to market. Ideas are a dime a dozen. Execution is what counts, by people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and yes, Elizabeth Holmes. \n\nMany think billions were spent on Theranos, but there weren't any billions. Theranos raised and spent well under a billion dollars, and all of that was used to develop the technology and bring it to market. All companies spend much, much more to do the latter than to do the former. They have to. That's the way innovation works. \n\nJohn Carreyrou did some valuable reporting and I'm not sorry Theranos was shut down because of it. Theranos made a good effort but they did fail and it was better to close them up quick than let them struggle on as a zombie. \n\nBut I am sorry that John Carreyrou misled so many people like Ross Douthat.

And over time, as the Republican Party clings to power by letting voters and itself off the hook, it ceases even trying to acknowledge reality and becomes instead a fraud, using all its money and big-time backers to discredit whistle-blowers.\n\nShifting away from fossil fuels would have been the \"moonshot\" Douthat claims to want, but instead of embracing that technological renaissance, the Republican Party chose to keep us trapped in our role as dystopia's lackeys, allowing us to collectively create problems but denied the opportunity to collectively solve them. Government is paralyzed because the Republican Party decided government was the enemy and has sought to sabotage it. \n\nDouthat labors long to avoid realities he refuses to acknowledge. If our politics has become \"futile\" and our frontiers seem closed, it's largely because of a backward-looking Party that thrives on propaganda and artificial polarization.",

The middle class was also America's middle in politics and it's middle consumer class and the American Dream Class - then, slowly but surely, they got hammered as corporations profited from lower wages by offshoring and buying parts from China, etc. and the well off \"invested\" in buying homes not to live in but to rent and raise the rent over and over (more homelessness) and education went corporate with huge salaries for the \"CEO\" and higher fees with weaponized loans after Government loans went private. No worries though. Part of the new neoliberal economics was the old feel-good story that that being poorer was the fault of the poor. This is not decadence, it's corruption which spread to politics after Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United \n which flooded our elections with money. We allow monopolies and don't permit the government to rule for the Public Good, and let money buy politicians and now let politicians trash the Constitution as ordinary Americans struggle and none other than the Party of FDR is horrified by the idea of Medicare for All - that's decadence.",

It seemed childish and self-indulgent.\n\nBut in the end, I was shaped by that period much like its most ardent adherents. I don't think we can accurately assess an era from inside it. It's later when things have moved on that we can see its real achievements. The 60's were successful in ways we couldn't see then. What's happening around us now--the good,  the bad and the ugly will be put in perspective in due time. \n\nDouthat's piece is very good and thoughtful. But I believe we do have a future.

His cases of high tech flimflam have been part of American culture for centuries- attempts to hoodwink the uninformed and gullible public.\n\nScientific progress, at least in the physical sciences, is not slowing down- just look at the ever increasing number of papers being published, the majority from abroad, with China dominating. But it comes at a cost, ground-breaking research requires ever more complex and expensive instrumentation. But we, as a society, have put a halt on most big science efforts, except for space exploration, for which we are willing to pay for bragging rights that eye-popping images and stories provide to enhance our international profile. Now we are just participants in the most advanced international science endeavors, like ITER,  LHC and others. Our last truly great effort was LIGO detecting gravitational waves in 2015; a 20 year effort costing $ 5 billion, and not to be repeated anytime soon. Other challenges are awaiting for S&T to address: climate change, urgent, costly and essential, and with promise to create many new jobs. The GOP will not support it anytime soon.

Do we as a natural species have a need for more material goods (that isn't a manufactured \"need\")?\n\nPerhaps the collective unconscious finds enough at this level - perhaps a bit less, even - and that further acquisitiveness comes with too high a price, of stress, addiction, conflict, aggression, degradation of our habitat, of violation of innate senses of proportion, decency and balance. Perhaps that \"dissatisfaction\" is what underlies the lassitude and inertia Douthat partly laments in a Calvinist's Dilemma.\n\nPerhaps this is a transcendental moment. Can we pivot toward a more balanced, modestly consuming lifestyle and foster repair of our stresses and tribal strife and repressions, and support our species's health? Can we also pivot to addressing the pending climate catastrophe (which ironically but not paradoxically will require pivoting to the necessary great but temporary technological and logistical lift to do it)?

Purchasing bomb supplies without detection is virtually impossible today unless you are a) exceptionally good with computers or b) willing to use Molotov cocktails. If the answer is a), you're better off hacking some sensitive information. If the answer is b), good luck with that one.\n\n2) You need to understand time is sensitive. Imagine the worldscape from the perspective of a child born yesterday. We don't really have the time to \"Chill Winston\" on [redacted] climate change. I'm sorry. The normal pendulums of politics are inadequate to the task of climate correction.\n\n3) Sanders isn't really revolutionary anyway. He's actually arguing for a 30 year reverse on supply oriented economics. Which, if you haven't noticed, we live in a demand oriented economy. Keynes was always right. Supply is dependent on the willingness and ability of labor to consume. Supply equals demand. No demand. No supply. Republicans have had the economy wrong since Carter.",

Ross\u2019 question is analogous to the oft mentioned question, also unanswerable, \u201cwhat is the greatest scientific discovery?\" A far more fruitful candidate than Ross\u2019 as being a \u201cpeak human achievement\u201d is the development of quantum theory early in the twentieth century; for without quantum mechanics, the electronic world in which shapes all phases of our daily lives wouldn\u2019t exist, including the serious envisaging of the Apollo moon landing. To say in response that the general public scarcely knows anything about quantum theory is not an adequate rebuttal, because the same was true with the educated public about its understanding of Isaac Newton\u2019s treatise, \u201cThe Principles of Natural Philosophy,\u201d published in 1689.

If in two hundred years the standard of living is fairly equal around the planet, and it doubles in quality and quantity every 70 years, who doesn't want to live that life? \nOur biggest challenge is to make sure everyone on Earth is offered that choice.

The stakes for our planet are too high, and the vast chasm between rich and poor is downright cruel.\n\nWe need a re-framing of what capitalism means in those contexts.

Another is our approach to land use and city planning - around the country, more and more people are waking up to the enormous externalities of urban design that prioritizes cars over people, resulting in environmental destruction, lack of physical fitness, social isolation, the hollowing out of small towns, unaffordable housing caused by supply constraints, punishing commutes, and countless other harms. \n\nAnd though I hesitate to say it as someone who has never had a non-white-collar job, I have to think part of the malaise (at least among educated professionals) has to do with how often it feels like we spend our days doing nothing but moving pixels around a screen - creating nothing that lasts or affects the world in any visible way.

His basic  thesis is that at certain points civilizations reach a point where they basically run out of gas. Our current period swings back roughly 600 years, with the end of the middle ages and the beginnings of the renaissance. If you look at that period, where Luther upended the power of the Catholic Church over European society, you see much of the hallmarks of today. You see an institution (there, the church) losing its grip to secular governments/authorities. The printing press made books and knowledge cheap enough to spur people becoming literate. Without the grip of the church, science  progressed (and yes, I am well aware that it happened within the church, too; but the point is, the church couldn't suppress it inside itself, either); but that loss of church authority caused a big period of disquiet and worse. The old social orders started to fall, church and the nobility led a feudal society that morphed into one of freemen and even a growing craft class. \n\nWhat we are seeing today is that change. Globalization has disrupted the nation state, today it is multi national corporations dominating things. Old cultural and social norms are changing, and this has spooked many, who retreat into uber conservative religious thought. The good news is from decadence something else often comes, and I suspect in our case it is going to be a revolt against  the internet bread and circus, to the new.",

Higher wages means they buy more, not only more stuff but also more services, and more experiences.  Startups form and expand to provide those services, experiences and goods.  \n\nConcerned about an aging population, a \"birth dearth\"?  Some of that is inevitable, and necessary, as we reach the limits of the Earth's resources to support 7 billion people,  but if we invested in our people in the form of subsidized childcare, high-quality public education including vocational education and college, and low-cost healthcare, those Americans who do want to have children will find it more viable to do so.\n\nEven in our politics, the failure to invest in our people is telling.  It shows in apathy and cynicism (why bother voting, it's rigged anyway), rampant corruption, and politics of division as 99% of Americans realize they are fighting over a smaller and smaller share of the pie.\n\nRenaissance is still possible, but it requires redistribution.  Put the money into the people, so that they don't feel a boot on their necks and are free to hope and dream, and the dynamism will come back.  But that's anathema to the GOP mindset, isn't it Ross?",

Grifters and liars will always be among us, as history has proven over and over again.  Today's grifters and liars are more visible and obvious because of the way news is instantly transmitted worldwide-----and because today's group of criminals include leaders of major (and formerly respectable) institutions such as the office of the Attorney General, the Senate Majority Leader, leaders of  major religious organizations,  and the President of the United States---along with his entire family.  Today we are witness to a level of profound lying, cheating, and grifting that is remarkable for its shamelessness. However,  I remain confident that most Americans are more honorable and more decent than these so-called leaders. In the grand scheme of things, history has proven to be cyclical, and we must hope that this too will pass----and above all, we must vote for those who still represent the values of most American citizens. At the moment, that precludes voting for any candidate with a GOP after his/her name.",

Compare American trains to those in Japan or Europe; it\u2019s embarrassing. We could have great public schools to train students for our future but instead conservatives call them \u201cgovernment schools\u201d and give our taxes instead to religious schools that teach creationism and graduate level schools of economics and business bow to unfettered capitalism as their God.
