They do not believe in democracy, the rule of law, the Constitution, truth, or even voting rights, have nothing but contempt for anyone not in their class, and count on the apathy of Americans to let them have their way. Trump isn't the greatest threat to our nation, Republicans are. This impeachment \"trial\" shows perfectly their unwillingness to put country above their interests. Vote every one of them out.",

Trump didn't ask anyone to prosecute Biden or anyone else. He asked in order to get the Ukrainian point of view.  As far as the aid goes, we were about to give them a significant amount. Isn't it reasonable make sure just how corrupt they are. Isn't it reasonable to confirm what Biden said.  The one person they had as a witness who asked Trump what he wanted them to do told us he said he didn't want anything. \"Just do the right thing\". So vote.

Apparently not. \n\nKristol can only come to the conclusion that we now live under a Presidential dictatorship, where even an adverse electoral result in November 2020 will be unilaterally declared \"an attempt to overturn the will of the people\".  That is the only sane conclusion one can come to. The new habit of 24x7 bald faced lying is the announcement of the dictatorship of all those \"drafting\" behind Trump: \"We don't care what you think, we're simply going to announce our deeds and act accordingly, as we roll out and impose our Roveian altenate reality\".\n\nSo, liberals, what are you going to do about it?  You could start by ENDING ALL cooperation with this lawless government. Stop funding it. With illegitimate government,  force is in command,  not consent. \n\nOr you can look on the bright side.  At least Sarah Palin will be able to see Russia from her back yard.",

It's dangerous because it would lead to an impeachment inquiry every time a president's opponents objected to a policy decision.  Lincoln's suspension of habeas was arguably an abuse of office; so too was FDR's rounding up of Japanese Americans.  Bush could have been impeached for the Iraq War; Obama should have been impeached for granting immigration status to groups without Congressional approval (indeed, the latter was a stunning 'grab' of power by Obama yet liberals did not object). There would be no end to impeachment inquires and the attempt to disclose confidential communications between a President and his closest advisers.  Impeachment is only for 'high crimes and misdemeanors\" not \"maladministration.\"",

This means that the check on a \"Rogue President\" rests with the voters, ideally every 4 years.  Removal via impeachment is intended to be used as an emergency brake when a super majority of the voters (The Senators are after all elected to represent the views of their constituents) decide that the country can't wait for an election.  What this means is that removal by impeachment is not possible unless a substantial number of those who voted the President into office are convinced that he needs to be removed.  This is the Job of the House impeachment inquiry.  In the cases of both Clinton and Trump they didn't even try.  Ergo Trump will be acquitted just like Clinton was.",

Trump lost to Clinton in the popular vote in 2016.  The will of the country was for Clinton.  The electoral college result is what gave Trump the Presidency.   If impeachment were put to a popular vote then President Trump would become the the first President to be convicted and removed from office.  The electoral college system, which is not in the constitution, is outdated and no longer needed.  The electoral college process no longer reflects the will of the American People and should be abolished in favor of the popular vote.  It is just common sense.  The second highest bidder in an auction doesn't win the lot, why should an election be any different?",

Well, I picked up and moved my self at 14, telling my parents that, despite having 2 great friends, I could no longer live there. \n\nI made my decision early andmade it with my feet, never looking back. My time living in the US allowed me to predict, with astinishment from my peers, that Trump had a very good chqnce of winning. He is hate and hate is everywhere in the US.\n\nNow, despite what my US relations think, Canada is far from perfect. Yet we have apologized and begun make reparations to Natives that were treated poorly and the same for South Asians turned away. From my experience, this place, Canada, now, is a far better place than the USA. Maybe not for shopping, or hustling, but maybe for placing a \u201chome sweet home\u201d sign.",

As a result, the current government acts against the American people instead of for them. This statement currently holds true for both parties.",

No chance there yet because Trump can still squeeze that last dollar from the public trough with all his trips to Mar-a-Lago. After reelection, I do expect him to pawn Florida off on the Spanish before he leaves office, what with the rising seas. Of course, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott will defend the action. Rick Scott knows making money is the American way, especially if you can run a company that can defraud the government, leave the company holding the bag, keep your wealth, and become governor and senator in the bargain. Rubio? Well, there is at least an ancestral Spanish connection somewhere back there. Anyway, you can't live under water, can you? Two more Republican senators down!\n\nHere is where it starts to get tricky. Once Florida is gone with the waves, Trump will realize the royalties for The Wall go to Pink Floyd or their assigns, so he might as well make something out of selling the Southwest to Mexico. Since it will likely all be Blue anyway, Republican will let it go.  \n\nBut even Trump can go too far for Republicans. Just wait until he decides to give the rest of the ravaged country back to Native Americans. They will rise up in righteous indignation about that one. Right? After all, they have standards and a moral responsibility to do the right thing, right? Their directional adjective says so, right?",

Their disloyalty to the American experiment began long before the Clinton impeachment, before Clinton's inauguration, before the voodoo I-get-mine-not-you economics of Ronald Reagan. It started in the late 1940's with the divorce of Dixiecrats from the Democratic Party and their marriage to the Republican Party. That's what killed Lincoln's Party and made it a party of white self preservation, a party of party first, party over country.\n\nThat's why the middle class is now the minikin class. That's why Reagan sold weapons to Iran to finance a secret illegal war. That's why Clinton was impeached...why W. Bush was appointed president by a Republican Supreme Court...why Bush could invade Iraq as opposition was labeled unpatriotic, why Obama was blamed for Bush's Great Recession and not given credit for saving our economy from a Great Depression...why his recovery efforts were impeded by McConnell et al..why the Garland nomination was blocked...why a smaller number of ideologues now dictate to the nation, policies opposed by the vast majority of people.",

            "comment_body": "This trial reminds me of the Rodney King trial of 1991.  The defense strategy was to demonstrate that every individual blow struck by every officer was withing department guidelines.  And it worked.  \nBut the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  The same is true of the Trump \"presidency.\"  Republicans want to show that every individual action of Trump was either completely legitimate or else so close to it that the difference is negligible. All sane people know that Trump's entire \"presidency\" and the campaign before it is built on lie after lie, and the damning aspect of it is not each individual lie but the nonstop flow of them morning to night ad infinitum.  \n     Pelosi's strategy of limiting the scope of impeachment to the Ukraine affair seemed like a sound one, and it may have been the only one that could have succeeded in the House.  However there is a great risk that these few, specific actions of the \"president\" will not appear to be so out of bounds as to warrant his removal.  Just as in the King trial, by closing our eyes to the whole of the horror of Trump, out of an unwillingness or inability to grasp that whole and hold it in our minds at once, the criminal or criminals will likely go free.",

He is the only President to survive a coup and a Deep State that is working with Democrats to stop him. Yes, stop him. Because that is what this is all about. He beat Hillary and you lefties hate that. It's hard to accept that Trump represents a majority of states as designed to prevent what lefties want and that is mob rule. The USA is a Constitutional Democratic Republic NOT a Democracy.\n\nTrump wont be removed from office because the Democrat House Impeachment is a joke. Trump will be reelected in 2020 by an even larger Electoral College win than 2016 and the GOP will gain more seats in the US Senate. Because all of this involves politics and the Lefties are not as good as Trump with politics. He knows exactly what you people think and he runs his administration against it.\n\nThen Census 2020 will take House seats away from Blue state and give them to Red states.\n\nPrepare yourselves Lefties because its gonna be a bumpy Trump second term.\n\nI know this upsets many of you because you cannot accept the truth. Most non-Lefties dont even chime into to these echo chambers because any dissent is immediately ushered off to the gulags.\n\nThe Democrat Party is the Party of slavery, segregation, the KKK, and war and always has been.

But if they weren\u2019t paying attention to Democratic impeachment proceedings in the House, they almost certainly are now. \n\nTrump, Fox Noise, and his various enablers had repeatedly and grossly mischaracterized the findings, but Adam Schiff and crew are doing a masterful job of laying out the timeline and presenting the mountain of evidence obtained so far. And, of course, Trump looks guilty as sin even though the specific culpability of his senior enablers is somewhat less clear.\n\nMore evidence isn\u2019t really needed to find Trump guilty, but it does threaten folks like Pompeo, Pence, Mulvaney, and Perry. And the reputational hit to the Republican Party is not insignificant the longer this process plays out.\n\nMy prediction is that the Republican majority will avoid additional witnesses or documents, and instead they will try to find a way to censure Trump and then move on. Only if Trump insists on a full exoneration does he risk having to produce more evidence. I think there will be more than enough pressure to force a stark choice on the president. Either back off and accept a slap on the hand or risk even more damage to everyone. Or in effect that\u2019s what I predict Republicans will try. I just don\u2019t know what congressional Democrats would be able to do in response.",

Yes, Trump's crimes are far more serious and if we knew the whole story well even more so.  But still, I can see the Republican's returning the favor that the Democrats in the Senate bestowed upon Clinton when he was facing removal from office.  Plus, given the Clinton's prominent role as leading figures in the Democratic Party, I can see why the Cliinton card is being played by the Republicans. So lets say that after the Republicans refuse to convict Trump in this impeachment trial that they will have evened the score with the Democrats? Henceforth, if a President commits high crimes and misdemeanors  in office, that impartial justice will be served regardless of party affiliations?

Every president could have been impeached.  Or none of them.\n\nFortunately, throughout most of the country\u2019s history, lawmakers viewed impeachment as a serious, draconian action.  A nuclear weapon of the political process.  \n\nThe framers of the Constitution understood this, which is why they created such a large 2/3 hurdle for Senate ratification.\n\nBut after a single impeachment in the first 180 years or so, we\u2019ve now had three in the last 40 years.  Why?\n\nLawmakers have trivialized it for political gain. (This trivialization was manifested elegantly when Nancy Pelosi handed out gold-plated impeachment pens as souvenirs.) \n\nIndeed, the goal is no longer to actually remove a president from office.  It is simply to \u201cstain\u201d the reputation of a president, hopefully weakening her/him politically.  It is designed to rally a political base and gain control over the news cycle.  \n\nImpeachment is merely the new censure.  \n\nOh impeachment, where is thy sting?

Elsewhere in today's Times, Yanzhong Huang notes a report via we chat directly from China, that the epidemic has \"Broke Out\" and a new Imperial College of London study today estimates many thousands of unreported cases in Wuhan and spread throughout China. Which brings me back to Trump's response that \"We have a plan\". OMG. His idea of a plan to Ebola was close the borders and maroon American health workers who got sick. Now he has an emergency where he may soon be able to make a real argument that he needs to close the borders. What will Trump do with emergency powers?",

But, before you get feeling too self-righteous doing that, look in the mirror for the ultimate enablers, people who do not take the trouble to insist we teach civics, people who are content to bask in the ignorance of not knowing (or caring about) the difference between Constitutional, legal, and political.",

They wanted a bone he gave them steak sprinkled with his own fake sizzle. He has drawn his base into such a frenzy that the Republican leadership is trapped in his popularity. \n\nInstead of going after Trump behaving illegally in just one affair the Democrats must go after his ineligibility for the White House on account of his insane brain \n\nFocusing on Trump's insanity will highlight America's #1 problem.

Emotional health (EH) is the foundation of health and yet there is no testing or manual for EH. Emotional baggage disorder (EBD) must emerge as our #1 priority out of this drama",

First, there\u2019s no judicial review, making it unique in American law. Second, and perhaps more important:  Senators originally were selected by state legislatures, and were meant to resemble the House of Lords. The Framers never thought that Senators would be subject to the same petty concerns of electoral politics that governs the actions of the House of Representatives. \nI don\u2019t know what the answer is, but a couple of possibilities are term limits on Senators or moving impeachment to the Supreme Court. One of the best things about federal judges is that life tenure frees them from concerns about whether following their consciences will result in loss of position.",

McConnell scamming the public, but he seems to be conning his fellow Republican Senators as well. \n\nYes, McConnell seems to have been animated for years by some sort of dark force that led him to abdicate any greater purpose than defeating all attempts at governance by Democrats.  But what are the rest of the GOP Senators thinking? \n\nHas he really led them to believe that by holding the line as though this were a football game, and not a matter determinative of our nation's future as a democracy, they are going to accomplish something other than \"win\" in the hollowest of senses?\n\nIt seems he  has -- and that's the con.  Because by acquitting Trump, all that these senators will accomplish for themselves personally, and in their personal political careers, is the betrayal of their interests as Americans and the consequent foreshortening of  their future in elected office.  \n\nFor It's just a matter of time before the President's lack of ethics comes home to roost.  If it hasn't happened already, and Trump remains in office, there is nothing stopping him from pulling the same monkey business when he stands to gain from manipulating domestic spending.  \n\nSo, wake up GOP Senators.  When Trump's corruption hits the headlines next, when his tax returns come public, when we learn of all the versions of Ukraine that have been going on here at home, not a single one of you Republican sheep are going to evade America's outrage.",

Could he just walk down the street randomly shooting everyone in his path and no one could do anything because he was president? What if he didn't just try to get Biden investigated by a foreign government but actually shot him to death? Would Trump be held accountable for killing a political adversary?  This is a slippery slope. When Republicans say he is above the law and can impede an investigation, fail to honor subpoenas, essentially do anything he wants as long as the economy seems to be going okay (I would argue it isn't), what are they doing to our country?  Is there no way to prevent him from criminal behavior (such as conspiring with foreign nations against the USA)?

Anybody who suggests that doing so does not create at least as good of a chance of \"losing our Republic\" as inaction is a fool. Why? Because only roughly half of the public believes in removing him from office. This is not a convincing statistic. I do not blame the Senate for not wanting to remove him with such weak support for doing so. Their inaction is a result of the position of the public, not the other way around. We must face the facts that the public simply does not support such a drastic action enough to warrant it (at this time).\n\n2) The actions of the President are reprehensible and should not go unchecked. Perhaps the impeachment itself will provide him enough of a deterrence for the remainder of his term(s). I do not personally believe that it will, however, it is certainly possible. The problem more lies with what he does afterwords, if not removed. Most of us who have endured this Presidency realize that a quick acquittal by the Senate will only embolden the man. Hopefully these Senators who are about to publicly hide from avoiding this obvious injustice will have the courage to at least let the President know that they will not hesitate to remove him from Office.",

I decided to remain optimistic and keep an open mind - maybe they'd have some reasonable thoughts about how a trial should be run?\n\nNo. For ten minutes several of them carried on about how 1) the trial was just boring and not good for TV ratings, 2) someone on the Democratic side sounded like the teacher in Charlie Brown cartoons and probably wears mom jeans, 3) the marble against which the speakers stood was ugly, and 4) this is all just a waste of time and the Senate should just get back to serving the people.\n\nClearly the strategy from the White House down through the Senate and all the way to Fox is to discuss everything and anything but Trump's misconduct.\n\nOh, and this afternoon Lindsey Graham also said this trial was unfair because the Democrats just want to \"take down this man.\" (So next time you're caught red-handed committing a crime, folks, just remember this defense: you can get off if you feel that your accuser doesn't like you.)\n\nSo McConnell's \"trial\" is indeed a sad and dangerous travesty of justice. And since the GOP media arm is falling into line as usual, its audience will never understand this. Disturbing.",

But he also faces re-election and has other issues: controversies about the business dealings of his wife Elaine Chow, Secretary of Transportation (a family member of a Chinese shipping conglomerate), and circumstances about a Russian oligarch investing in Kentucky. The prospect of jobs has locals salivating. They don't care where they come from and I don't blame them. Despite McConnell's control of congress,Kentucky is one of the poorest states. That makes no sense to me unless it serves him in some way. But the reason he controls the senate is his craven manipulation of judge confirmation. We are stuck with McConnell until he can't confirm conservative judges OR he is defeated in 2020. I hope that Kentuckians will give serious consideration to Amy McGrath, the veteran military pilot who is challenging McConnell.",

On top of that even if they were subpoenaed, Trump says he would immediately claim \"Executive Privilege\", and block them again - which would require another court fight.

They are going to play unfair, so long as their calculations are that it could perpetuate their political power. Only when the Republicans become convinced that their strategy will cause them to lose their political power will they change their strategy and behavior. If they can. But for now, this is who the Republican Party is. They are more like a cult fighting for their right to exist than a reasonable political party playing politics as we are used to.",

They ignored, obfuscated, confused and distracted from the incontrovertible fact that the subpoenas had been issued and requests for documents made, and Trump had obstructed them from being produced, based on executive privilege.  They said, repeatedly, the venue for compelling  production of both was a matter for the courts to decide and , as such, Trump was being denied due process, unless and until the courts rendered an opinion.  If that wasn't laughable enough now McConnell is using similar tactics to forestall the production of witnesses and documents.  He has the \"votes\" to kill any impeachment trial rule that would allow subsequent production of the same witnesses the House sought.  In my heart, I know there will be a day of reckoning for McConnell's malfeasance.

The Senate created a trial of willful deceit where the rules of what most Americans see as a trial (witnesses and evidence) is not being allowed. \nI have come to the conclusion that our Constitution is what is flawed and needs to be brought into the 21st century. After witnessing the last 3 years of American government the answer should be clear to any and every American. We need a Constitutional Convention. It is time Americans wake up to the reality that 250 years ago is not today. What has come to pass is a mockery of political process and the greed and power that has taken hold of our freedoms. \n\nI honestly want to stay in America and be near what very little family I have left. I am retiring soon. I served my country proudly when I donned a Navy uniform. Today, watching the process, the only thoughts that I am able to grab onto is migrants are trying to get in and all I want to do is head south. Watching McConnell and knowing he is part of the power and greed and his right to turn the process to his own will simply brings shame to our nation. Trump was elected by an antiquated system. Regardless, he is totally unqualified and in fact if anyone was astute enough to read his history would know he is also a criminal getting away with it.  Hora de retirarse en Columbia.

Clinton committed no \"crime\" in fooling around with Monica Lewinsky, they were both consenting adults. But he was impeached for lying about it, cornered to lie about it.  Trump ATTEMPTED to bribe or extort Ukraine to cough up dirt on a political opponent. He has lied over and over to Congress and the American public about this, about Russia, about what he does all day for that matter.  It does not matter that he didn't completely get what he wanted to damage Biden (though it is sure in the news now) or that Ukraine eventually got their monetary aid...but only after making it look like Ukraine was low priority in Trump's eyes to impress Putin. He was caught in the act.  If I shoot you and miss, or bribe a cop who declines, it's still a crime. But even if we don't think of this quid pro quo with Ukraine as a crime itself, the cover up, the obstruction of justice with the Congressional investigation IS-therefore the impeachment articles as is. Just saying \"NO\" is not a defense, everything Trump has done to resist oversight, to resist allowing witnesses, claiming \"privilege\" over his own wrongdoing, refusing to turn over documents and forcing the timeline into sometime in 2021 is obstruction, it's covering up, and it IS a crime.",

There is a whole lot at stake in this next election and Democrats have to act to avoid the calamity that will occur if Trump takes the next election.\nThink about preventing more restrictive voting laws being enacted by Republicans. Think about restoring balance to the Supreme Court by expanding the number of justices and filling those new positions with at least more centrist justices, if not more outright liberal ones.

(In a strictly legal setting such as a courtroom there is no confusion about the meaning of the term 'presiding judge'.) \n\n    The House members could not petition the Senate (as if they had all the powers of a Senator) for subpoenas, documents, etc. as they would have no standing in the Senate but for their role as prosecutors of a case before the presiding Chief Justice of the United States who should preside over all questions of the admissibility of evidence under federal guidelines. (The Senate can arguably overrule the Judge but they should have to go on the record to do so in every instance.) \n\n   Neither the defense nor the jury gets to compel or suppress evidence in lieu of the judge in a jury trial. If you allow this you can end up with a kangaroo court which no respecting Chief Justice should be expected or compelled to participate in as it is a travesty of his office. You can argue that by overruling the Judge the result will be the same in the end, however the Chief Justice of the United States should not be facilitating a travesty by sitting idly by in the first instance.",

The GOP has no integrity. They do not desire to uphold and defend the constitution, nor are they interested in justice. They care little about Trump's unethical acts. They could care less who he hurts and what ramifications it has on the future of democracy in this country. All McConnell, the GOP , and Trump himself care about is mocking democrats and winning.",

Tax payers should revolt, and march on Washington to show their displeasure with they way their money is being spent. I'd be first in line.",

In what kind of fair trial does the defendant have the right to decide what evidence s/he wants suppressed? Isn't that for the judge to decide?

She could have been saddled with that dead beat forever.\n\nPoliticians love to drag out women who have serious regrets about their abortions, usually because they\u2019ve been \u201cborn a again\u201d, which is just a Evangelicals\u2019 euphemism for growing up and stopping partying and sleeping a round. \n\nThe fact is that the majority of women wish they had more info from their own mothers about preventing pregnancy, wish they weren\u2019t inhibited by alcohol ( not saying rape but more like forgetting condoms with a partner) and wish they had better access to birth control so they wouldn\u2019t have to rely on the man to provide protection from pregnancy. But they don\u2019t regret their decision if they later go on to have children. Maybe it gets complicated if a beloved spouse passes or there are utility problems later on.\n\nWomen, believe it or not, actually have a large enough brain capacity to determine whether they want to alter their lives forever BEFORE they have an abortion.",

And if the excuse is religion makes it okay to suppress a strangers rights then change religions or understand your religious boundaries of compassion and stop knowing what is best for someone you do not even know.

With all the contraception we have available now, a woman's choice ( or man's choice ) is to be respected. It is no joyful thing to get an abortion; people aren't overjoyed when they have to do this; no one is celebrating having to undergo this procedure. One's body is one's own affair. You should keep your own morals for your own body. Yet, I feel there is some kind of tragedy for the woman involved.\n   A policy of failure, it is, but only the failure of contraception. It's about time for society to grow up, to throw off the hypocrisy of religion, fairy-tales of fake morality, and the anti-science moronic policies of the past. We know better now. For whatever reason, another's body is none of anyone else's concern. This is a call for a woman or a couple and their doctor. That is a sacred conversation. Keep your eyes on your own behavior . \"Do not do unto others as you would not have them do unto you.\" This is the actual quote. \n         If you are against abortions, simply do not have one.",

As a result I became a master at self deception and spent years in denial. Then I developed the courage to launch an introspective journey to find the truth. I now know beyond doubt, that having an abortion was the biggest mistake of my life. Even though I would have made a terrible mother; even though I would have had to sacrifice my dreams; and even though my life would have been extremely difficult if I had chosen to give birth. Please consider that to say we have the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is to devalue all our lives. Life is a continuum from conception to death. None of us would be here if we had not been conceived. It stands to reason that if our lives matter now, our lives mattered at the moment of conception onward. If our lives matter now, then so do everyone else's including the unborn. To believe otherwise is beyond exclusionary. All of us matter or none of us do. For the women who claim to have a right to decide what to do with their bodies, I could not agree more. But once we are pregnant, there are two bodies involved. We have been entrusted to make a decision regarding the fate of another human being. Roe vs Wade gave us the legal authority to betray that sacred trust. Instead, make wiser choices when our bodies are all we have to consider, especially about with whom and when to engage in sexual activity.",

I know personally of four women who died from botched abortions, I remember their names and their faces. Two were young teens, one the victim of statutory rape, the other the victim of gang rape. She was fourteen. Unfortunately she lived in a tough area where young girls were targeted for attack. I bet the same thing happens today. The other two women were mothers whose husbands decided to clean out the bank account and abandon them while they were pregnant. Note that all of these women were able to access abortion. You could ask around and get a name and a number and get an abortion. It was dangerous, but most women could get one. There were many more abortions back then than most people and many more deaths too. The way to reduce abortion is by offering excellent sex education, making contraception free and available. It is important too to teach men more responsibility for their behavior towards women. Some abortions are the result of contraceptive failure, poor health or fetal deformity. The remainder involve a man who has either behaved irresponsibly or has committed a crime.",

But, no-one walks away from the experience unscathed.  There is a kind of regret, a sadness, that a lot of women carry, knowing they did the right thing, but sorry that an abortion needed.  I remember finding myself, once, thinking that I might be pregnant and knowing that abortion would be my choice.  Being young and single at the beginning of my career, having a child would have meant a complete upheaval of my life, and having a child I didn't know that I could love.  I was fortunate that I wasn't, and relieved that it was not a decision I would have to make.   But, I did think about what it might mean for other women.  No-one can know what an abortion means except the woman, or girl, herself, and men haven't a clue.  Knowing you did the right thing for you is what is important and any burdens that you might be carrying around--you can put them down, now.  Be at peace with your past.",

Bottom line: the issue of the right to choose should be SOLELY within the purview and agency of the woman whose body is involved. Period.\n\nOne point here: If anti-choice individuals truly want to impact the number of abortions performed in the U.S., they would be well-advised to advocate for women to have greater access to birth control and health care generally. Studies show that abortion rates are at record lows - NOT because 32 (red) states have adopted abortion restrictions but likely precisely because the Affordable Care Act has made birth control more accessible for women. Ironically, most of those anti-choicers oppose such access. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/health/abortion-rate-dropped.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/health/abortion-rate-dropped.html</a>",

As former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper said, increasing contraception in his state dramatically reduced the number of abortions. While most people do feel relief after getting an abortion, it is the most complicated and controversial way to deal with an unwanted pregnancy. Because low-income and less educated women are more likely to have abortions, it would make sense to advance cheaper, more readily accessible contraception. As far as religion goes, it is only realistic to acknowledge the rightwing religious elements affecting the judiciary and the move to overturn Roe v. Wade. Overturning Roe v. Wade would not be based in science, but in a minority view most popular among the religious right. The establishment clause would be important to emphasize here. Outlawing abortion is not a bioethical stance\u2013\u2013studies show the nervous system of a fetus is not fully developed until weeks after birth and complex emotions do not develop until months after birth. It is a religious credo that would be imposed on nonbelievers, essentially establishing a particular religious view on Americans who do not choose to believe in it.",

It is truly baffling how divisive the issue of abortion is, as I personally see no one else being affected rather than the person choosing to have or not have one. Without the right to safe abortion, not only would there be children that were living in unfit environments, but women's lives would be put at risk, with many of them seeking illegal, high-risk procedures and at-home abortions.\n\nIn addition, the inequality that occurs in low-income areas, where healthcare access is limited due to affordability should be urgently tackled as a big issue. Regardless of socioeconomic class, everyone should have the right to safe healthcare and to safe abortion. In fact, an unwanted child born in a low-income area, with a family that most probably lacks the resources to raise and nurture it should alarm all of us. Children should be born in prepared, nurturing environments, with the resources needed to raise and provide for them. \n\nI support the opinion that just as any of us should have the autonomy to seek healthcare and treatment when sick, we should have the autonomy to make a conscious decision in regards to abortion, and know that we have a legal right to a safe, controlled procedure.",

This realization has helped to comfort me in my grief over that first pregnancy.",

Those movements simply asked that individuals not be discriminated against on the basis of something they could not change (sex, race, sexuality). Transgender activism asks us to deny the reality that there are two biological sexes, and to change society to allow anyone who declares themselves a woman to be allowed into women's sports, changing rooms, and prisons. To teenagers, It presents surgeries and lifelong dependence on synthetic hormones as a way to 'become your authentic self.' It encourages us to think that any child who does not follow sexist stereotypes should be put on puberty blockers that prevent the developlement of their bodies. Anyone who criticizes is besieged by a mob crying bigotry. I'm sure there are people who experience severe discomfort with their sexed bodies, but the response should first be therapy to explore the root of those feelings - not a rush to surgically alter the body. And adults have the right to do what they want with their bodies. But we cannot restructure society by denying the reality of two sexes), and must allow children to grow up without surgeons and synthetic drugs.",

I had a girlfriend long ago who, in speaking to her 5 year old son, called the back of her station wagon  the \"way back.\"  It annoyed me.  She changed my language.  I now realize it was my problem, not hers (or her son's), and in that respect, I was her problem.  \"Cisgender\" still annoys me, but as problems go, its the least of my worries.  And when I get used to it, it won't annoy me any more.  \n\n2) Regarding bathrooms: get real.  Mr. Conservative, when your seven year old daughter goes to the ladies room, do you really want her to have to deal with someone who looks totally male, with a beard, etc.  (Transmen seem to strive to look more masculine than their cisgender counterparts.)  And do you want to explain it to her?  Or would you prefer people doing what they have been doing- going to the place where they feel most comfortable, where other people have always been comfortable with them, where they don't stand out as anything but another person, and where there almost never has been a problem.  \n\nYes, during transition it gets a little complicated, but it is complicated however you arrange it.  And, like language, once you get used to it, it's not complicated or  \"a problem.\"",

As many comments here state, correctly IMHO, the left has failed in its PR campaign to win over the public on this issue because the movement has been taken over by folks who are too aggressive in their condemnation of anyone who doesn't embrace their view of gender as a social construct.  Frankly, most folks see gender as being inextricably intertwined with what they have between their legs, and to say that gender is something defined by society, and not biology, is a very complicated and confusing idea.  Reconciling themselves to such an idea, if that were even wise, takes time.  People don't change their views overnight, and they don't change them with the threat of being publicly tarred for mispronouncing pronouns.  Sometimes the most we can reasonably expect from our fellow humans is to be treated with decency.  I don't pretend to know what others truly feel about the world.  I can't- it's impossible.  But I can love them anyway, in my own flawed way.  I say redefine this movement away from identity politics and the pseudo-intellectual conceit of 'constructs' of this-or-that.  That goes nowhere.  What we all need to be doing, given what's going on politically, is to start having a meaningful conversation about what it means to treat each other decently, and in a broad sense, especially to those we can't stand.  Clinging to identity politics as a guide ain't gonna get us there.",

Third, even if this is true, from what I can tell there is no universally understood definition of transgender. Does it mean taking hormones? And if so, for how long? What hormone level is low enough to compete against girls? Why do girls even need to be worried about this? I think its just not fair (to either side) at the high school level. Now in college they routinely take drug and steroid tests and this could be managed without impacting any of the other athletes.

Also it is somewhat easier to retain muscle mass after testosterone withdrawal than to build up muscle mass in the absence of testosterone. After a year that advantage is negligible.\n\nWhat people need to remember is that we are talking about sports. No two people have the same advantages and disadvantages. No one can reach the highest level of achievement without tremendous work. Few people have the talent and drive to reach the highest levels whatever their hormonal status, but we all should have the opportunity to play on some level.\n\nA major concept of sportsmanship is fairness. What is fair to the transgender person who chooses to compete in sports? A male deprived of testosterone loses muscle mass and finds it extraordinarily difficult  to compete with men of similar talent. The NCAA has ruled that a transgender woman may compete on a men's team at any point. She may only compete on a woman's team after completing one full year of testosterone suppression. At that point, she has no hormonal strength advantage. No two people have the same talent, strength, and aptitude. It is most fair to everyone to allow the transgender woman to compete as a female at that point.",

After graduating the Haverford School and Wesleyan, she has landed at the all-women's refuge of Barnard, which is over-the-top tolerant of the LGBTQ community.  \n\nMs. Boylan also is protected by he wealth and her celebrity status.  She isaid to be worth $90 million in part because she is a reality TV personality who has frequented Oprah, the Today Show, etc., etc.  \n\nParticularly troubling for me is her outspoken defense of Caitlyn Jenner, along with her politics  --  Ms. Jenner, in her previous life, spewed racist hatred, using her (his) status as a decathlete to spread KKK-type views.\n\nI come at this from my own minority status, as a high-functioning bipolar personality.  For me, the notion of coming out is pretty much meaningless.  I share my mental health condition one person at a time.  And none of my confidantes are employers, admission officers, or gossips.\n\nI suspect that most (not all) of the LGBTQ community is like me.  We come out with those we trust, everyone else has no need to know.\n\nMs. Boylan came out publicly in her forties, when she already lived in a fortress making guest public appearances and then retreating back to her safe haven.  Good for her.  But her life is beyond pretty much everyone else and she is hardly a role model for the man or woman on the street..",

Oh, I was always open minded regarding gender conformity and sexual orientation. As a child, my favorite Aunt was clearly gender non-conforming. We'd go camping with Becky, and her life partner Helen, and have a great time. To me, as a young boy, Becky, with her bright colored shirts, khaki vest, and denim jeans was more fun than all my other Aunts combined.\n\nWhat really changed me was accompanying a dear cousin, Lori, through transition to Liam. We talked together many times and it was clear that Liam, as Lori, was totally uncomfortable in his own skin. The transition was definitely the right thing to do, and Liam's spouse, Diana, and children, Eve and Lev, were totally supportive. Liam was never so happy and full of life as Lori as he is as Liam. With his mustachio and deep baritone voice, he is a pint sized linebacker bubbling with love for life.  He, and his family, are a great joy. I love them all dearly and consider myself very lucky to have them as part of my family.",

Plenty of Dems surely look down on trans folks whatever they may say.  Most Republicans are openly hostile.  But, apart from the super-religious, their attitudes are not cast in stone. \n\nIf you show a Republican how to sell a million widgets to the trans community, you've made a friend for life.  And\nthere is good reason for the trans community to pursue professions that lean GOP -- blue collar jobs, big business, law enforcement and military, among others.  \n\nMinorities truly arrive when their choices are not grounded in their minority status.  Pigeonhole yourself and you will be taken for granted.  Unless your vote is in play, you remain a second class citizen.   \n\nDems may give you handouts while resisting your effort to move in next door.  By contrast, non-religious Republicans may profess opposition while welcoming your home improvements that upgrade the neighborhood.\n\nI am bipolar.

A few years later she begrudgingly accepted gay marriages.  One can only hope that wide acceptance of trans people (and other gender identities) will go the same way, though hopefully faster.

(I noted the small percentage of trans athletes and few controversies, concluding the uproar was more about the angry people's small-mindedness more than anything.) I view transgender people as the vanguard of our country's opening to the possibility of a sexuality and gender continuum. Currently less than 1 percent of America identifies as trans. But as we saw with LGBTQ acceptance, more people will probably come out the more it is socially acceptable. And as we can extrapolate from the Kinsey scale, gender associations likely exist on a spectrum. While some males may feel they have no feminine qualities and vice versa, symmetry is prominent in biological forms. And therefore each gender has members who identify with traits of other genders, even if we don't talk about it. The sexuality spectrum, backed by research, is finally showing up in people's identities as nonbinary and bisexual. Some day in the future, I predict the gender spectrum will too. As far as the hypocritical believers, I think sexual hangups are what drive people to some of the most restrictive forms of faith positions on sex and those versions of faith confirm their already preconceived ideas about sex.  There have been studies that found a correlation between religious individuals and lack of sexual thoughts and experiences.",

If you haven't seen the images of all races and sexual preferences coming together against tyranny at the Richmond Rally, you are in a bubble.  Why are you erasing their history?  Ask any NRA member whether, in the context of the second amendment, the Black Panther Party is a hero or a heel, you will hear universal acclaim.  This piece smells of coastal elitism that deals in stereotype by an author who has never bothered to talk gun politics with an actual gun owner.  This march was never about race and all were welcome.  It is about tyranny.\n\nIf your idealized gun owner is angry and white, maybe it is a projection.",

But I would be interested in hearing from a psychologist or someone who follows fashion as it relates to a look of a culture or particular group. Is the look of the protestors accidental or deliberate? To me someone having a goatee gives off the look of someone trying to look the tough guy, someone with a short fuse, someone not to mess with. The cammo I guess equates them with being quasi-military and makes them feel more tough, more superior and more secure. Being overweight is the anomaly. That one undermines the tough guy appearance by giving off the look of a coach potato. I guess that one is just a symptom of living in modern America, living an unhealthy lifestyle.",

There is an insistence to label entire groups by those who turn out- a toxic trait for those with all-inclusive, sweeping opinions. This protest was about much more than the weapons themselves, but rather about the slippery slope that this kind of sweeping action entails. There are dozens of examples of localities stripping gun rights (and severely limiting those who are still legal) that show that the U.S. is not the same as these other countries people tend to turn to for data solace. Look at Chicago. U.S. citizens have a right to bear arms and have since inception- stripping of such rights is not something that should happen quietly, whether you support the right to bear arms or you do not.

As a born-and-raised Detroiter, I'm reminded of the story of Dr. Ossian Sweet, a black man who exercised his Second Amendment rights when a white mob wanted him to leave their \"whites only\" neighborhood in the 1920s, shooting and killing one after the mob began throwing stones and bricks. He and the home's occupants were jailed, but eventually (rightfully) acquitted. Long story short: Anti-gun = anti-black. Gun laws that began popping up in the early 20th century were racist.

While we're at it, how about instituting a surtax on all Americans who have not served that goes into a federal retirement fund for veterans to supplement Social Security? Or maybe simply provide a significant lifetime annual tax reduction/exemption for all vets? Most of us are working and middle class folks...not 1%-ers...not going to retire rich.

These guys \"should just join the military\" because they belong somewhere out there defending the American empire instead of here on the streets of America where they seem out of place (even though they look like our militarized law enforcement.) But liberals don't see them as a real threat. They must be reasoned with and beg them to disarm. If they felt truly threatened, they would be calling for their side to arm up as well.",

His two fellow white escapees simply received added years.\nAfter Bacon's Rebellion, black were targeted in that only blacks would harvest tobacco, a messy process.\nIn 1691 blacks were forbidden to marry whites; again targeting one group exclusive.  Never in history of world had this happened and remained in effect until 1967 when finally  the USSC struck down miscegenation in Loving v.

In fact, their roots go through the non-slave north. Many post date slavery entirely, by decades.\n\nBut their roots share something in common - oppression and dispossession where they came from. Life in Europe was not a fairy tale of princesses, talking pets and fairy godmothers. It was frequently bloody and violent. European history is savage. Nationalities crushed by stronger neighbors and subsumed into empires at the end of a sword or bayonet. \n\nWe, the white people of the USA, are frequently the descendants of those who were weak. Our roots came here to get away from all that. And we are determined to never be under the boot of another again. \n\nOur later descendants served in WWI and WWII. Korea and Vietnam. We\u2019ve seen what totalitarians and nationalist madmen will do. Communists and socialists, too.  You know. Your friends. \n\nThat\u2019s why we have Don\u2019t Tread On Me flags and support gun rights. Because we know the only thing between us and those totalitarians are the guns in private hands.",

We were surprised because this instructor taught a lot of firearms classes including tactical, low-light and combat classes. He said it's because women are teachable.

Back before America was settled by Europeans, the average European commoner was not even allowed to own a firearm or even hunt for game like deer or elk; that was reserved for nobility!\n\nWhat were Africans doing back then? Well, they basically did not have a gun culture, which means that when the tribal men hunted, they were way closer to the dangerous game they were hunting. Talk about brave! Would you come face to face with a lion with limited weapons? Probably not.\n\nBoth societies had similar homemaking challenges: due to the lack of machines, humans had to do most things manually from farming, to water gathering and wood chopping. Of course both Europe and Africa had structures wherein most people were simply used as cheap labor, often to the point of being an indentured servant or even a slave.\n\nAdd on top of this the religious component. Right or wrong, religion didn\u2019t have a long history of being flexible. Christians fought Christians, Christians fought Muslims, Christians and Muslims dominated Jews. Rare, but existent, were the great kings of the pre-Jesus past showing religious tolerance.\n\nThere\u2019s a German word: P\u00f6bel (poebel) which means the rift raft part of the population, the uneducated commoners, the worker bees of society, a.k.a. the people. \u201cWe the people [dregs]...\u201d Not so nice, huh.\n\nGuns don\u2019t stand in the way of progress, they just slow it down.",

I would love to ask them why they need semi-automatic weapons at Starbucks. And are there any statistics on whether a concealed weapon is less effective than an open carry weapon in the course of daily life? How do threats to the men Mr. Boule names compare to those of women for whom the danger of attack when out alone after dark is very real, as well as the fact that more women are likely to be killed than men in mass shootings? Before I bought a gun in the 80s I signed up for a women's handgun safety course which was 15 hours of handling, regulations, myth-busting, safe practices, disassembling. On the range one evening the instructor commented how much easier it is to teach handgun safety to women. We were surprised because this instructor taught a lot of butch firearms classes including tactical, low-light and combat classes. He said it's because women come in knowing they're beginners, and unlike many men, women don't think they're born knowing how handle a gun.",

The image of a black man with a gun, no matter the context, evokes anxiety, fear. But is this surprising? Majorities are ever afraid of minorities. People, of whatever color, are not innately cosmopolitan, liberal, tolerant, and race-blind. Leftists teach kids the evils of America without giving them any historical context, leaving them to see our ills as unique in the world.\n\nRace is a bigger problem in oh-so-white Europe; and racism is particularly bad in Eastern Europe, which is whiter still. Tribalism and clan conflict has torn Africa apart since before colonialism. What is distinctive about America is the extent to which it has changed, has \"civilized,\" has been able to build the first ever multiracial democracy. Our gun insanity, and our violence, is to be expected in a frontier nation inhabited, once, by mysterious, sometimes-brutal Neolithic tribes. How surprising is it that a white majority has tried to tear up this democracy since blacks were enfranchised and since our immigration levels have gone up?\n\nThere's a way in which woke progressives agree with illiberal whites, in the sense that they imply that skin color, income level, and background, determine who you are, what you see and how you see it. What was once called bigotry is now enlightenment. ... You see only one aspect of American history, Bouie -- so why only read books you already agree with?",

Nobody had done that before and open carry of guns was mostly a hunting season thing until the Panthers did this. Given that the Panthers talked about how white officials were pigs and that the people should kill the pigs, the fear that this display produced was to be expected.\n\nBut if one went into the communities where most African Americans lived, one would find a lot of gun owners who owned guns for hunting, target shooting , and home protection. In rural areas, everyone had guns because they were needed. \n\nThe image Mr. Bouie is presenting of the gun being the emblem of the white supremacist oppressor is hyperbole and it just adds to the confusion. What is true is that those who are white supremacists and white nationalists who display weapons to intimidate others are truly a social problem which we all need to address.\n\nBut let's get to the real problem with gun violence, it's too little gun control in highly densely populated areas and a failure to address the risks of allowing people who are highly likely to commit physical violence to retain guns. That would be people who have acted out violently without reason and those who are often so affected by emotions or substance abuse that they cannot act responsibly. That would be people who think that guns are a way to intimidate others into doing as they want.",

They do, however, have an unwavering distrust of government.  This is arguably in the American DNA.  They quite literally equate guns with freedom.  It's on the same level for them as free speech.   Gun control, for them, is a slippery slope to tyranny.   It's not entirely illogical.  Bad things have happened to the disarmed populace.  It's hard for a lot of people to understand, but if you were born into their family and raised where they were raised, you'd share the same views.   Many of them would probably be fine with \"reasonable\" gun control, if somebody could assure them that the ultimate goal wasn't confiscation.  The problem is that the ultimate goal for a lot of progressives IS confiscation.   Thus, every gun control measure is met with skepticism.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  If you're going to live with guns, you're going to live with gun violence.

            "comment_body": "There's some interesting history in this article, but casting gun ownership in terms of race is an oversimplification.  About half of white households have a gun in the home, which is only about 17% higher than the number of black households with guns, which in turn is 10% more than the number of Hispanic households with guns. (Pew, 2017)\n\nThe really glaring difference is between urban and rural households; rural households have double the rate of gun ownership as urban ones. And rural gun owners tend to have multiple guns in the home in higher percentages. This I believe is reflective of a much higher passion and identification with gun ownership among rural people than urban ones. Tellingly, people of all races and genders who identify as Republican tend to own guns at over twice the rate as people identifying as Democrats.\n\nSo while it is true that race can be predictive of gun ownership, the higher predictors are gender, (men own guns in much higher percentages than women), political persuasion, and whether the person lives in a rural area or in a city.\n\nNote that the article doesn't cite much historical basis at all for the much lower rate of gun ownership by white women than white men overall. Thus while historical issues around race may play a role in gun ownership, it's an oversimplification to view it primarily through that lens. Gender (regardless of race), political bent, and living in the country or the city are also major factors.",

People are being killed by firearms:  in their homes by suicide or murder, in malls, schools, and places of worship.  And gun owners ONLY suggestion to address the cries of the people who want it to stop is for more people to carry more guns.  We put safety caps on medication bottles.  We search you and your bags before getting on airplanes. We remove dangerous products from shelves when people are hurt or killed by them. We put airbags and seatbelts in cars.

As kids, we had perhaps a dozen run-ins with cops in my youth for standard shenanigans: being out after curfew, drinking, smoking cannabis, speeding in a car, etc. There were similar situations at school: fights, talking back to teachers, etc. Not one of us was ever so much as given a ticket, or any more than detention at school. \n\nMy current Friends of Color relate entirely different stories of their youth and adults with school officials and cops, despite socioeconomic similarities both when they were kids and as adults. \n\nThe 3 times I have been a passenger and the driver African American during a police stop, the police were definitively more aggressive and militant, their hands on their guns, commands to step out of the vehicle, requests to search the car (despite not actually speeding, despite being in 'nice' cars and well-dressed). \n\nI have never been issued a moving violation; despite a half dozen traffic stops in my life. I have never been asked to step out of the vehicle, never been asked if they could search my car. \n\nWhile this is all anecdotal, the statistics reveal that People of Color, whether kids or adults, often receive dramatically harsher and more aggressive treatment at the hands of school officials and police as children, and police as adults. I can\u2019t imagine having to live in fear of the police\u2026. \n\n\n.",

I've considered buying a gun many times, in what I consider weaker moments, out of fear for my safety and that of my family; fortunately, my rational mind and rational spouse have always prevailed.\n\nThe protesters who marched in Virginia are guilty of bad taste, intimidation, and, in my view, horrible judgment.

I have never seen one even touch his gun.  They love to intimidate, but pretty much all the guns are unloaded.  Just because they enjoy a good spat doesn't mean they are ready to be convicted of murder.\n\nThose on the coasts are unhinged by the window dressing.

Ofcourse it makes sense to disallow disarmament because that would lead to easy subjugation of the masses by a few powerful. However the most powerful gun owned by a government official or soldier, 2 centuries ago, was also the same as the one owned by an average citizen. So the only thing that separated the government's military strength and a citizen militia's military strength is strength in numbers of individuals. However the strongest weapon owned by the government today is a nuclear weapon!! If all of the citizens, Democrats and Republicans, gun owners and non gun owners alike came together and decided that the government deserved to be overthrown, the strongest weapon they would have at their disposal is an AR15!! A truly oppressive government does not need bans on guns. It can snuff out an uprising like that with a single explosive whose power is unmatched to anything that can be manufactured in someone's garage (such as happens in Syria, etc). So here we find ourselves - owning weapons that are woefully inadequate for a true mutiny, but far too powerful to be safely applied for personal protection and hobbies. Is it any wonder then that all we can do is turn it on each other?",

Nor did they call for better studies of the causes and prevention of gun violence.\n8) While there were Black protestors, JB's assertion a la Reagan is correct.",

If they are truly interested in protecting their rights then talk to other people with out the gun in hand or hanging on your neck or both. The fact that they stand with their guns in their hands is simply a tactic of intimidation so why when they claim to be on a peaceful march do they act in an intimidating manner. I guess if I want to talk to one of them I have to carry a gun to make them understand I mean business? Is that what they call civil discourse? I think not. We all know what they want, unfettered access to guns. Perhaps they need to know that not all of us see a gun as the answer to everything. I personally do not believe that the Constitutional amendment, #2, is absolute. But to have any sort of conversations about it they need to leave their guns home and come and talk with out intimidating anyone with their weapons.",

Is it that as baby boomers aged into the workforce at a time of a slowing U.S. economy, white racism escalated exponentially to erode gains made by African Americans during WWII and afterward?  That's my guess.  \n\nThis country still has a lot to do to atone for its past -- but I'm proud of the Pittsburgh that produced Mr. Harris, The Courier and August Wilson (as a kid I spent countless hours in the Oakland Library where Mr. Wilson worked and wrote his plays) and it saddens me greatly that Pittsbugh's African American population is declining.",

If self-preservation were involved, both groups should be doing their darnedest for gun control (whites because guns are far and away the most effective tool for suicide; blacks because they're more likely to be victims).\n\nWhile hardly pro-gun (I'm a pacifist Quaker who has had the opportunity to look down a barrel during a hold-up), I believe that this subject is prone to suffering from more heat than light, and that polarization is being fanned by interests that benefit from our discord.  \n\nDo we need hundreds of millions of guns in this country?  Obviously not.  But that's a symptom, not a cause.

To state that the sole purpose of being armed during the colonial period, particularly the  very early colonial period, was only to seize territory and put down slave insurrections is patently false. Sudden raids by bands of French and Indians was foremost in the minds of the early English settlers. Perhaps an example of revisionist history here.\nSuch statements need to be avoided if your column is to be accepted as credible.\nTo my knowledge there are no laws in this country that prohibit gun ownership or the right to assemble with their guns directed at any particular race or political position.

Currier and Ives printed posters celebrating their exploits which could be seen in the best \"colored\" homes and in some white ones as well.\n\nAs long as the Buffalo Soldiers were out of sight on the frontier everything was cool.  When they started showing what they could do and making national news, when the Army command started moving them through or into Jim Crow land, there was a real uproar.\n\nWithin 10 years the Army produced a study concluding that African Americans were unfit for combat duty.  By the time the US entered the Great War, there was no thought of assigning Black men to combat units.  They mostly went into labor battalions.  One exception was the 15th New York volunteers AKA the Harlem Hellfighters.  They were already organized so they were sent to France as a unit and attached to the French Army.

The words also appear in the first Pennsylvania constitution specifically for self-defense.  I am sure the author knows that blacks in the south during Jim Crow who were farmers were armed to the teeth, and largely invulnerable; the major violence was visited upon blacks who worked for whites and could not afford to protect themselves.  I say this not to defend those marching in Richmond; they represent neolithic man.  Rather I think it worth respecting that their march was peaceful, that they have a point of view that must be considered, and the problem of gun control is not likely to be moved along by declaring guns to be instrumental in previous epochs of violence to races.  The use of violence for a cause is too universal to ascribe its use just to those causes we abhor.  Religious terrorism killed more than 7.5 million people in the Thirty Years War, all of them white.  The answer, if there is one, seems to me to rest in what I take Bayard Rustin's resting words on the subject, in the actual mixing of our races together, the only circumstances under which humanity overcomes all else. \n\nKim Maxwell (Quaker by background, pacifist by disposition)",

After the Revolution, there was still a legitimate threat from England, realized in the War of 1812. The framers of the Constitution also realized that restricting gun ownership at that time would monopolize lethal force within the government. And they had just cast off a tyrannical government. America has for a long period of time been dominated by white men. That is indisputable. But I doubt it was founded as a \"white republic.\" It was founded under the principles of liberty and equality, as they were understood by the socially conditioned humans of the time.

In the next couple of hours an ad for that very firm popped up. I hadn't done any searches online that would have triggered the ad. This sort of thing happens a lot. I now don't like to have my phone near me all the time; instead,I leave it in another room where I can still hear it ring. It's a little sci-fi spy, I can't figure out how to turn the listening function off, and it creeps me out.",

Because, to someone, somewhere, all of us are criminals for some reasons, including reasons that will never occur to us unless someone is in a position to accuse us publicly, or to arrest us covertly.  In the case of an entity such as the current Chinese government, criminality might be based on nothing more than \"you make me uncomfortable somehow, even if it's hard for me to say why\" or \"you haven't done anything I don't like yet, but I can imagine you doing something someday\".  I personally don't think I could avoid being considered a criminal if I came under the control of an ISIS government, nor do I imagine that Mr. Manjoo would, nor would the overwhelming majority of people likely to read this comment, devout Muslims included.  Here is the base argument for privacy.  The counterargument will be some variant on \"preventing another 9/11 attack is worth violating the privacy of everyone in the world\".  But it's already too late not to violate the privacy of at least most of the world's population.  The only remaining question is, will there be any limits at all on the violations?",

Why does everyone keep saying that? Not \"anyone's phone\" at all, but only the phones of criminals and criminal suspects. It is like saying that courts' ability to issue search warrants implies that they want the \"untrustworthy F.B.I. and any local cop\" to be able to enter and search anyone's home. \"They\" don't want that at all. All they want is a legitimate means to collect evidence of criminal wrongdoing for presenting in court in order to convict the criminals. What is so wrong with that? Why nobody is up in arms against court-issued search warrants? Does rummaging through one's home not violate his privacy even more than searching through their phone? Why should criminals be entitled to encrypted phones where they can safely keep all evidence of their crimes from prosecution? Why should law enforcement not be able to obtain a warrant and search for that evidence? That \"privacy\" argument is such an illogical red herring. It makes zero sense.",

Since I joined Amazon KDP in 2010, thinking of it as yeah, Freedom!!!!--I have been through traumatic episodes, including losing my apartment and credit cards, and during such a time, I hastily \"published\" books which no one purchased, then realized the titles, covers, or content were impulsive mistakes, and therefore unpublished them. But Amazon insists that every book published on its site be listed forever as well as on the Goodreads site it owns. And thus, my ill-thought mistakes have been made permanent, because Amazon wishes to have power over me, forever.  So my truly important and best books are buried under the titles I no longer wish to be associated with. Why?

This database will be used to determine how patriotic and politically correct his or her lifestyle is, and will be quantified in a number. Those whose Social Credit ranking is found lacking, can then be penalized. For instance, if you frequent \"problematic\" venues, buy books deemed \"unhealthy,\" or maintain social media contacts with other \"problematic\" personalities, you can be denied the \"privilege\" of boarding an airplane or train, or renting a car.

Delete unused apps, check privacy settings. I deleted FB a while ago, but that's only a feel good effort. I have still have IG, which is just as bad I'm sure. I need to get rid of Gmail. Any NYT readers have a good suggestion for an email service that isn't interested in the content of your emails? Proton? Proton says all the right things, but I have no idea who's running that platform.\n\nI know there aren't really too many \"good guys\" in all of this, but so far I've been pleased to see Apple at least making the effort.

Most of their research then doesn't find much to disagree with this, except a few find that the supposedly open-minded liberals are often hypocritical.\n\nBut there are potentially other approaches to the issue.  For instance, many people may take a logical position that disadvantaged minorities would make more progress if they heard fewer elites making excuses for their counter-productive behaviors.  Others may take an also-logical position that brain-drain and ambition-drain are hurting the poor countries that so many immigrants are leaving.  Also, there are logically plenty of problems with having a large segment of the population here illegally, and so some discouragement is also logical.\n\nI'm not necessarily supporting these views.  But I can see how they could be held by people who are reasonable and genuinely sympathetic toward people who look different from themselves.   Many of these may be Trump voters who could be won back if the models allowed consideration of more viewpoints. There is no doubt that Hillary lost a lot of votes for her \"deplorables\" line (slip-up language which many highly educated liberals said to themselves and to friends around that time and still do).",

I think that inequality, of income, of opportunity, of resources, is the problem, not diversity per se. When resources of all kinds are plentiful, and people are less worried about their own survival, then people are more tolerant in general. When resources of all kinds become more scarce then people feel like they have to fight for \"survival\" of themselves and their nuclear group or tribe and they become much less tolerant of anyone outside their narrowly focused tribe. I think this is the dynamic going on in the so-called heartland.\n  Human behavior is still determined, to an amazing degree by the primitive behaviors which were genetically selected for by evolution thousands of years ago when we lived in primitive tribes. Trump's behavior is exhibit A when it comes to this.",

For many decades the Republican Party has worked strategically to preserve the power of its clients and its own office-holders even in the face of demographic shifts and various crises---from civil rights through the climate crisis---that could diminish its sway.  The Democratic Party tends to be less effective mobilizing power, perhaps because it is ambivalent about who it is serving (the Sanders analysis) and perhaps because it led us down a rabbit hole in Vietnam from which we may have still not emerged.  Trump persists because he's able to mobilize the power of a diminishing minority that still has more economic heft than the miscellaneous minorities in the new Democratic majority, and he has amply repaid his backers in the American business community.  Along the way he has mobilized attitudes--racist or xenophobic, or reactionary or fearful or threatened or nostalgic for the greater America, and/or combinations of these tropes--that enable him to pretend he has the right and power to rule by responding only to his base.",

The notion that they were under economic pressure is not correct. \n\nThis certainly sums the frustration I have when confronting the views of Trump voters here: \"low effort thinking promotes political conservatism.\" The more drunk people are, the more they behave like political conservatives. And, finally, something we already know: education is correlated with liberalism.",

Yes - history sometimes is relevant.\n\nDuring the Gilded Age, the  Democrats absorbed the more left-leaning Populist Party and included a Populist plank or two in their platform. While the subsequent decision to give the presidential nomination to populist William Jennings Bryan did not result in victory during the 1896 campaign, Bryan nonetheless secured a seat a in the cabinet of President Woodrow Wilson some years later. Here, Democrats accepted the virtues of unity in spite of internal ideological differences.\n\nIn 1948, a compromise could not be reached and so the leftists walked out and united behind Henry Wallace of the Progressive Party. In spite of losing their votes. Democratic candidate Harry Truman won reelection, thus leaving the leftists out in the cold. On of Wallace's supporters, George McGovern, won the Democratic nomination in 1972 and went on to lose forty-nine of fifty states.\n\nThe success of the Democrats in remaining united for 2020 will in large part depend on whether that which unites them is greater than that which divides them. I am not confident that the necessary unity will remain.",

It does not. Evolution does not really act at all.  It is simply change that results when  individuals with some characteristics have better reproductive success than others, given their environment.\n\nSelection, one of the mechanisms of evolution, does act, and it certainly can result in adaptive heterogeneity within a group. The fact that our species has two sexes is an example of adaptive heterogeneity. But the substate on which natural selection acts is the individual.\n\nThe evolved state of group heterogeneity( some people being liberal and others conservative, for example) is an unintended result of a situation in which diversity of opinion was of reproductive benefit to  individual members of the group.\n\nShe probably knows all this but was just speaking loosely.",

This fear escalates sharply when economic and social times are tough, as they have been for tens of millions of less educated, mostly white Americans. Hillary Clinton was dismissive of these voters, a fact which they clearly and accurately perceived. Why would they vote for her? They could feel in their bones her disrespect, even contempt. This was especially true of less educated white men. Although Trump has done less than nothing to enhance the lives of these people, he at least pretended to care about their plight. We liberal Democrats could not have fielded a worse candidate in 2016. In addition, many poor and minority voters stayed home, sensing no rapport with the candidate, who showed a profound charisma deficit. Finally, Trump has been shrewd enough to effectively engage the Lord of the Flies factor.

It is due to their abandonment of their long held supposed belief in probity, in truth, in actual conservatism.  In other words, they called themselves conservatives but they abandoned principle in a heartbeat.  Fiscal conservatism, don't make me laugh, trillion dollar deficits to finance idiotic tax cuts.

Trump stumbles from one self created crisis to another, then he reverses course and declares a great victory.

Citizen's United makes clear the degree that wealth has legitimized and concentrated power in fewer and fewer hands.  Native Americans and Afro-Americans are still prevented from being full partners and participants in the 'American Dream'.  The vote is being manipulated.  The three 'co-equal' branches of Government are no longer co-equal, but are co-opted  by wealth and power.\n\nAs the planetary environment is steadily being destroyed by human behavior, we have very little time to recover a way to conserve what is healthy and good (for all), and what must be repaired to survive.   The time and way depend on truth, reality and making the correct decisions and sacrifices.",

But it is hard to prove that can happen and violates solid, mathematical evolutionary facts. Evolution selects individuals (actually their genes) and if their gene combinations \"allow\" them to survive they thrive and produce more children. Thus their genes then become more common and the frequency of those genes in the population become more common.\nThus Trumps self-centered nature, his need for power and full control spread.  (yes, the environment did play some role in the expression of behavior in Trump also; but the genes predisposed. His parents ignored him). Power hungry people galore anywhere will become tyrants if possible. People will help others particularly if they are relatives and if they \"reciprocate\" in the altruistic sense. \nBut to imply that racism and  and and \"bad\" attitudes toward immigrants and  and homeless people will in general trigger disgust in most people is not supported by evolutionary data or theory or facts.Having genes which would embrace groups of people in those categories are likely to be selected against in most communities unless they were direct relatives.

The truth is at any level of society people really do care about themselves first. It is not that people don't want the best for others, but their reality is based on their own personal experience and what makes that better or worse. like a strong economy. That is what is keeping Trump in office. Now, are you so liberal that you hope the economy tanks to get rid of Trump? You know all those people that are at the bottom of society liberals supposedly care about so much. If that happens those will have it 10x worse, but again people understand life from their viewpoint and how it affects them. Being liberal is a privilege of the wealthy or the extremely poor. the wealthy have enough wealth to pay additional taxes and enjoy the finer things in life. It doesn't affect them. The poor need government programs to survive and are fairly or unfairly viewed in question because of it.

Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973), the \"suburbanization\" of housing development, \"White flight,\" and the rise of private schools as an alternative to public schools. The only certainty in this matter is that public schools fail or succeed in aiding a rise from the bottom social mobility based on particular local circumstances: how the school taxing district aligns with taxable value of real estate and the political response. My community is fortunate: the school district did not face the rise of separate suburban communities \"pulling up the ladders\" to keep out lower income residents and leave them with an insufficient tax base. Due to the balkanization of small rural school districts elsewhere in the state, standards are not met. The legislature always says it is doing its best for public schools and higher education, but it has not caught up with the 2008 recession cutbacks. This is where conservative voices are raised in objection to increases in state appropriations and property tax override elections because the schools and teachers unions are \"wasting my tax money (on other people)\"",

A centrist such as Bernie Sanders doing well in American politics is inspiring and I have only waited 40 years for him to get to this point.   I have hope that this country can be saved from the economic terrorism of the American right-wing and the stupidity of neoliberal oligarchs (Mrs. Clinton should be backing him instead of trying to undermine him).\n\nThe criticism of those who have to work for a living and only have time to send contributions to their candidate rather than show up at a demonstration unarmed and thus become a victim of the plutocrats' police forces just shows how out of touch the upper class is with the lives of us working stiffs.  I laughed out loud at that.  The author needs to wake up and look around him.",

A basic problem is that power can be gained by lying to increase fear which is exactly what a demagogue such as Trump does.

They saw our inmate/charges as 1) responsible for their own predicaments, incapable of rehabilitation,  prone to violent behavior, untrustworthy, and generally a drain on society and tax dollars. Their empathy manifested in making sure meals were served, meds handed out to those in need, and risk of assault was minimized by separating offenders according to risk and criminal history. No matter how many people were hired with college degrees, who manifested a more holistic approach, with an emphasis on introducing treatment and educational programs the prevailing culture ( long ingrained in the lifer, low education  employees dominated). Some came from the military, some had a high school degree, most couldn't find jobs anywhere else in a depressed logging town.

Others do not.\n\nFor example, most progressives seem to believe that if a country is almost exclusively inhabited by white people of the same ethnicity, that is self-evidently wrong, a clear sign of racism and something that urgently calls for active efforts to bring as many non-white people as possible into that country to fix its abhorrent lack of diversity.\n\nOthers believe that it's perfectly fine that a country where historically no non-white people existed, remains that way. And has no obligation whatsoever to allow immigration, let alone encourage it. \n\n(The same would be true for a country in Africa that has only black people, although this issue does not come up in practical terms because nobody wants to immigrate there.)",

In fact, they like him more because he lies.  They say to themselves, \"Now WE have a politician who can get away with lying.  We finally have a politician that refuses to play on unlevel playing field.\"  They may not always articulate this out loud, but often they do.  They cheer Trump when he says something outrageous, and they cheer even more when his critics have a meltdown over it.

What Candy Crowley did during the debate between Romney and Obama was unconscionable, but the media rushed to defend her.

It is no coincidence that the rise of conservative media (first, with talk radio and then with Fox News) happened at the same time these rural white communities were being displaced in the workforce, going bankrupt due to health issues and abusing opioids. They were literally at home more and in despair. They tuned into Limbaugh, Beck, O\u2019Reily, Robertson etc., everyday and were given scapegoats.

Could the answer be she has no other interests?\nThe GOP supporters have withdrawn from the world and are withdrawing from anyone who has a difference of opinion. There are some Trump voters who vote their pocketbooks but most just have withdrawn so deep into their shells that politics has become their whole life, When politics is your whole life \u2013 racism, bigotry, misogyny, dictatorships, abuse of power, and obstruction of justice become acceptable.\nThere\u2019s virtually no interest in the GOP in art, theater, dance, movies, TV, humor that isn\u2019t offensive, reading, travel, nor science.

Religious intolerance is another major factor, and explains why Trump postures himself as a zealot when he knows little about Christianity.  Visit predominantly White areas and speak to the residents.  The conversations are frightening.  I just returned from a visit to a west coast Florida city with a burgeoning population- a virtually all White population.  There were no Blacks, Asians, Latinos or Jews.

While both masculine and feminine energy are essential for making a working culture, men now are confused about manhood.   There seems to be a cultural message that manhood, by its existence is somehow \"bad.\"  The long held ideal of men as moral humans capable of strength, protection, leadership, clear-eyed reason, moral authority, has been tossed aside and nothing has replaced it.  Add to this that  research indicates that many men are actually friendless, or nearly so.   Enter Rush, Sean, and their ilk.  They don't seem afraid of male energy.   They talk to these fellows (and women too) everyday so they must be their friends, right?  Plus they agree with them on everything!   They are \"real guys.\" They like guns and stuff.\n\nSo one explanation of Trump persistence is evidence of a craving for male energy in the public sphere, a huge deficit of real friendships among men, airwaves overtaken by toxic simpletons, and heartbreaking, disturbing and ultimately culture destroying understanding of what is means to \"be a man.\"",

On the other hand there is a reverse scenario to the threat matrix discussed here, which is that many of the Republicans I know now feel that their future and that of their children is in jeopardy because of Trump's policies and our hyper materialist and consumption culture. Because of this, they are thinking of voting Democratic for the first time. Perhaps this is the built-in self-correcting mechanism of our republic, but I fear it's kicked in too late to save us and the planet from unprecedented disaster.",

So if you were on the other side on an issue, you were somehow \"immoral.\"  The problem with that is that it's difficult to find any agreement when you are basically insulting the other side as \"morally deficient.\"\n\nUnfortunately, in recent years, liberals have seemed to take the same approach, making the political environment doubly toxic.  Certainly, we have a President who is morally deficient, but when Hillary Clinton talked of the \"basket of deplorables,\" it left the impression, intended or not, that anyone who shared any of Trump's views fell into that same category.  That's a pretty offensive accusation.\n\nIf we're going to get rid of the current administration and get ourselves back on track, we need a Democratic candidate who can make his/her case without demonizing voters who are not 100% in agreement.

Trump was the first successful Republican to give voice to the bigotry of the base.

Republicans cannot restrain Trump because he has the solid support of the base, and their votes are required to elect Republicans.",

These people never really use the term income inequality, but the terms they do use point to the problem.\n\nSince I'm a liberal and most of my friends are moderate to liberal I understand what kind of explanations I will get about politics and politicians.

The Democratic Party is on the right track in advocating for student loan forgiveness, increasing Pell Grants, and free tuition to 2- and/or 4-year institutions of higher education, and providing additional funding to K-12 school districts whose property taxes based on SES does not provide adequate financing for a quality education.\n\nSo long as there exists major disparities in educational funding and opportunities, we will be doomed as a nation to the continuation of tribalism\u2019s appeal, and which portends a dangerous outcome for our democratic principle of \u201cE pluribus unum.\u201d",

Then they vilify the supporters of the other side if their side loses.\n\nHere's my take on why Trump once one, and will win again: he is not a politician. Being a businessman, he has listened to what his 'customers' want. He has understood the grievances of a significant segment of Americans. On the other hand, Hilary Clinton spoke for all Democrat politicians and their supporting journalists, when she labelled Trump supporters 'deplorables'. \n\nRemoving Trump is not a solution for the voters, if 49% of voters (or whatever the latest number is) believe that what he stands for is better than what the Democrats stand for.\n\nThe Democrats are ready for 'anyone but Trump', just as Labour was ready for 'Anyone but Boris Johnson'. I don't think the Americans in general hate Trump as much as the Democrats do. \n\nWhen the people see the Democratic political machinery parade a long list of candidates for the primaries, it looks clear that those in charge don't think any of them is attractive enough, but just hope that the voters will pick one. Any one. \n\nIf I were a Democrat supporting voter, I would take it as an insult to my intelligence and do what the UK voters did to Labour. Throw them out.",

Perhaps that fear made us feel more aligned with each other, being all in one existentially-threatened tribe? And, curiously, an aspect of the Cold War was competition between the US and USSR to demonstrate to other nations which system resulted in the better society -- perhaps driving the US to pursue overt policies to diminish the effects of racism, increase wellbeing, and distribute its wealth more widely.

The tariffs which are still in place from the US-China trade war have cost the average person $675 per year for consumer goods. The tax cuts aimed at easing Corporate tax rates eliminated tax deductions for those in the middle, thus providing gains for those at the top & stock holders, yet saving the blue collar class very little. The perception that immigration is what is threatening the average working person's economic or safety situation has proven to be fallacious. Immigrants actually improve the economic well being of communities rather than vice versa & are less likely to engage in violent crime.  The politicians like Trump want so called Conservatives to believe that brown people are threatening their way of life, yet these are fear tactics which strengthen his cult like status rather than prophetic words of wisdom shared among his voters.

Trump knows what he's doing when he plies crowds with his idiocies.\n\nThreat and anxiety tends to make us more conservative, as implied here.

We hate him -- but how are we going to take him on? And who can manage it?\n\nWe err when we think humans are more rational than they are: we should strive to be our better selves.

Our minds are formed in the creche of our family and our family's society. We never have all the information needed to make the kind of wise choices we might make if our minds were larger in terms of information content. Education does help with that issue, but like all things in human culture, it is rationed out to those in favor in any given social setting (please see the recent college entrance scandal), it is not universally available to all members of US society. Neither are living-wage jobs, food, housing, healthcare, clothing, etc.\u2014all the things that predict people will get along more easily.

The idea that each individual can \"make a difference\" in a nation as big and complex as the United States, is a fairy tale. In any case, I  personally am deeply convinced that a determinist viewpoint is not simply justifiable, but correct -- as borne out by the events of the past 50 years and more.

I think its also important that those interactions are among social and economic equals to make people feel more comfortable with those unlike themselves. \n\nAs far as the liberal vs. conservative coalitions, my theory has always been that it's much easier to get conservatives going in the same direction, because socially (today's conservatism is not financial), they all believe the same things, while liberals have much more diversity of thought and competing agendas.

As resources (financial, cognitive, emotional, psychological, etc) collapse people become more selfish, which seems natural to me.  Projecting this on to a Trump supporter shows that that person is under a lot of stress. Trump becomes the embodiment their anxieties, a howl of frustration.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to read this remembering that a majority of Americans are against Trump and what he stands for.   Trump supporters are in the minority, even if they are louder, more heavily armed, and have the Senate.  What this tells me is that a majority of Americans are still willing to do the hard work necessary to maintain and improve the lives of Americans.  \n\nQuite frankly, many Trump supporters seem to support Trump for no other reason than they don\u2019t like Democrats.  Democrats seem to be willing (though perhaps not as much as other Dems might always want) to do the hard, messy, and not always successful work of being inclusive. For someone who believes they are continually under attack it must be infuriating and humiliating to watch other Americans who are able to continually rise up and work to make the country better for all Americans and not just a favored tribe. \n\nSo, what can they do except howl on Twitter, brandish their firearms, and elect Mitch McConnell?",

I'm not a Trump fan as much as I am anti-Democrat, so short of murder or starting a nuclear war, I don't really care too awful much about the whining of the Liberal left and the Dems about Trump's antics or character.   He lowered my taxes and is enforcing immigration laws.  Despite the goddawful debt and the endless wars that neither party will address, I have no problem with this arrangement.   This also shows my complete lack of empathy for the Democrats, which further emphasizes Edsall's points.",

How that translates to future voting remains to be seen.\n\nThe University of Arkansas research findings are surprising to me. The idea that low-effort thinking promotes political conservatism doesn't seem rational..however, it does seem logical that it takes a serious degree of thought and cognitive ability to develop the liberal reasoning for protecting the homeless, the needy and those with less abilities. \n\nWhat's scary to me are Professor Skitka's research findings that indicate that liberals respond to the needy more like conservatives when resources are scarce. What that means to me is, we tend to get conservative when our safety is threatened. \n\nIf, for example, political winds are blowing into the face of an elected republican president, that president could potentially get quick votes by reducing the nation's stability. \n\nA scenario could be: a republican president with his back to the wall quickly creates, for no good, necessary reason, a military conflict with a nuclear-armed country. The public fears war with that nation might result in our getting nuked, and the result is an increased tendency for voters to vote conservative. \n\nNow let's wonder...where has this scenario been recently exercised?",
