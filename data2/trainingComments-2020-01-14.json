Defend your decision upon the art itself.\n\nFor example, with the disgust and outrage over Stephen King's comment: I fail to see how it was so outrageous that a voter should not take into consideration identity in the matters of art?  Are we truly asking that voters view a piece of art and think to themselves \"I think this piece is worthy of an award in its category, let's see who the director was...oh...nevermind, they are (choose whatever category you wish)\"  \n\nDoesn't that just sound backwards and wrong? \n\nInclusion, representation and diversity are so very important, but to exclude or include based upon these matters isn't progress.",

In any case, Oscar has spent the last few years honoring movies with black subjects and black actors in leading roles (including the maudlin \"Green Book\").  This year, that happens not to be the case.  Fault movie executives for spending so little time and money greenlighting original projects that would appeal to intelligent viewers of all races and ethnicities.  Oscar voters have, on the other hand, generally done their best with the material they've been offered for year-end appraisal.",

The same should be done for the Best Director category as well; keeping it as five really deprives many noteworthy directorial achievements that should  be remembered in the nominations; also, movies don't direct themselves: a year with 9 best picture nominees shouldn't have only 5 best director nominees; (2) the Academy should also expand the acting categories by 1-2  more actors whenever the initial results for  5th, 6th and 7th are very close. The Emmys often have 6-7 nominees in certain categories, depending on the  particular year, often in the supporting acting category. This should also be the case for the Oscars. (3)  Truthfully, I didn't see what made Florence Pugh's perf. supporting actress worthy. It was good work but  not really Oscar level. Jennifer Lopez gave an exceptional performance and should have gotten Pugh's  slot. Lopez did  memorable work in a highly enjoyable, well executed film. \n(4)  also remember TAXI DRIVER: for the 1977 Oscars, Martin Scorsese didn't even get a Best Director nomination, even though the film  had 4 noms, including Best Picture.The film today is recognized as one of the greatest American films of the 1970's, and is on the AFI's 100 greatest films of all time.

Examples include countless public works projects such as the Hoover dam, the WPA, the federal reserve, the postal service, the transcontinental railroad, the atomic bomb, the US highway system, ARPANET (precursor of the world wide web), medical advancements, and many more. These \"socialist\" projects have not only been good for America, they have have been fundamentally transformative.\n\nCurrently the US tax payers subsidize corporate risk by providing tax subsidies and other goodies. \n\nWhat many people don't realize about Sander's brand of policies is that it is not merely socialist redistribution of wealth, but - more accurately stated - a redistribution of speculative risk. Our most successful government initiatives have succeeded by absorbing enormous risk and capital expenditure in order to jump start entirely new industries. Such expenditures and coordination are nearly impossible for even the wealthiest private companies. Redistribution of the risk to all US tax payers is essential for a modern thriving economy if it is to maintain competitiveness in the global market. It is also, as it happens, essential for solving our most significant issues of the day that include health care and planetary \"therapy\" for reducing climate change impact.",

            "comment_body": "The biggest problem with Warren and Sanders is that they do not seem to be willing to learn from mistakes made in other countries. The head of a group called \"Democratic Socialists of America\" was interviewed after his group's membership increased to 50,000 from 5,000 after Bernie Sanders candidacy. He was asked if there was any place and time in history that was closest to where your view of democratic socialism flourished. His honest answer was: \"Sweden in the 1960s.\" Sweden remained capitalist throughout that period and has since rejected many of the things that were tried in the 1960s. Today the student loan issue is a bigger problem in Sweden than in the USA. Of course, those who think that the USA can retain market-priced healthcare indefinitely are also unwilling to learn from other countries.\n\nFor some food for thought regarding this, consider the events leading up to the American Civil War. One of the reasons that the south was willing to fight a very bloody and ultimately futile war in response to the election of Abraham Lincoln, was that an estimated 40% of all the capital in the south was in the form of slaves. In part of America today a similarly high percentage of wealth and capital is in forms related to fossil fuels. These include reserves, royalty interests, infrastructure and extraction facilities. Some climate change advocates advocate complete abandonment of fossil fuels. ..\"\n<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4315039\" target=\"_blank\">https://seekingalpha.com/article/4315039</a>",

He proved that when he was chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee from 2013-2015.  I explain:\n\nSanders' loves socialism and his pet cause is socialized medicine.  Care should be taken to distinguish between socialized medical insurance versus socialized medical care.  Socialized insurance is where the government owns and operates the insurance company (like Medicare).  Socialized medical care is where the medical care facilities are owned and operated by the government with doctors and other personnel being employees of the government (like the VA hospital system).  Generally, socialized medical care also incorporates socialized medical insurance.  Sanders sees socialized insurance as an interim step to socialized medical care.\n\nDo you recall the scandal of the VA putting patients on extremely long waiting lists for services, so long that some were even dying of their condition before they ever got treatment?  Sanders was chairman of VA oversight during then and intentionally ignored the many complaints made to him, more interested in protecting government organizations than the public they are to serve.",

I'm a woman and  I do NOT care if Bernie said this about women, blacks, whatever.   He may well be a misogynist, but it's far more likely that he's a pragmatist in a critical election year.  Cast a cold eye, Democrats, over every candidate in the field.\n   The thing is, Bernie, YOU can't defeat Trump either.  Regardless of what I personally think about you, your economic policies scare a lot of people.  And the FIRST priority is to defeat Trump.\nWe need a fairly moderate candidate whose governing abilities are known.  It's Biden or Bloomberg.

The Republicans would paint him as somewhat to the left of Lenin.\n\nDon't get me going on Joe Biden, another antique of doubtful ability.  Even Elizabeth Warren, who seems to be in good shape for her age, is questionable.  I thought the USA is a democracy, not a gerontocracy.",

I guess America would be a far better off place without any Social Security, worker protections, food stamps, Medicaid , or Medicare.  Because, after all, wealth is just holding back all their income and wealth until all these social programs are dismantled.  Then the trickle down can begin in earnest.  So, Bret, which party is it that is taking us down the wrong path: the one that demands a sharing of the wealth, that demands people not have to live in poverty without health care, and that insists that a path for social mobility be available to all regardless of ability to pay?  Or the party  that serves only the interest of the privileged.  The rest of America be damned?  The Guilded Age bought us FDR.  The Second Guilded Age bought us McConnell and Trump. The notion being FDR had it all wrong.  The real question is do we head further down the path of increasing wealth at the top.  Or , because that wealth has not been shared after promise upon promise they would do so, we turn back to the government demanding a level playing field?  Who really offers the masses the better deal?",

If prominent people in the media would tout that Mr. Sanders is most electable, or Ms. Warren or even someone else often enough, people who don't have the time or desire to research policy platforms could just as easily believe that as well.\n\nBernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are my top choices. I have no doubt that they care about the future of America, and hope to provide better opportunities for the majority for generations to come.\n\nReading this exchange between Gail Collins and Bret Stephens was even more agonizing than usual.

Yes, China and Russia are spending more than in the past,  but China's spending is still only 1/5th of the US (and has one (1) aircraft carrier)  and Russia's is only 1/10 of the US (and can barely send ships out to sea). They are only effective on the borders of their country.\n\nAnd maybe admit that if the US had not spent $3 trillion (military spending plus medical care for the resulting injured vets) in Iraq and Afghanistan that the US would have plenty of money for everything (remember how Bush refused to  put those wars on the budget?). Trump has done not better, spending like crazy but getting no tangible results.  \n\nOn top of that Trump idiotically has pulled back from international trade and aid that is effective at boosting allies. Predictably China is filling the gap. Trump could not be more stupid in that respect, and that is far more damaging that any military cuts. \n\nPlease, use a few of your brain cells to actually apply some critical thinking and stop regurgitating the standard right wing tropes.",

Life as they know it will be upended. It will be so hard to know who is on top and who is not. Bernie will never give in to Wall Street, and who the heck will he hire? \"No one we know and hang out with at cocktail parties \" they fret. \"Will we even have access when we have trashed him so?\" \"Dear God, must we embrace the masses too? and fight for them now?  Will he really be head of the Democratic party?  Can you imagine how boring the news will be from DC with just boring work horses serving the boring people?\" \"And when they throw our  friends the corrupt ones, out of office, are we supposed to never mention it was because of the corruption? Are we supposed to cut them dead?  Oh please Biden or Amy or anyone who can take a corporate bribe and lie well enough to get elected. And Ye Gods, we will have to  pay the same rate of taxes as the poor and middle class do ?\"\n\n I mentioned this before but it never got printed.

How did a woman raised in a conservative home end up at this point? Well, it\u2019s actually very simple: Republicans nominated a sexual predator, and as a victim of a sexual predator who knows many other women who were sexually harassed, abused, and assaulted, I said see ya, wouldn\u2019t wanna be ya. Abracadabra I guess that turned me into a progressive? Not a full-out Bernie progressive but heck, he\u2019s got my vote. Guess what else happened? My lifelong Republican conservative Christian Baby Boomer parents refused to vote for Trump too. All it took was hearing that disgusting Access Hollywood tape and my dad, who actually takes his religion seriously, was done.\n\nSo yes, I will vote for the Democrat, regardless of who it is.

That, as much as I really like Buttigieg, to me means it's Biden or Sanders.  Each has high enthusiasm and the energy of a crucial voting demo.  Sanders has the millennial and young voter enthusiasm that Biden lacks, and Biden has the Black/Latino/Minority voter enthusiasm that Sanders lacks.  All of the others, based on that, are probably out.  It's going to take at least one of those groups voting in huge numbers to win this election.  So who is more likely to vote? I don't know.  Historically, except for Obama, Minorities haven't been reliable.  That said, young voters have been even more unreliable.  So who's gonna show up this time? Good question, but here's what I think I know.  Biden is the only one who will get the minorities to come out at all, AND his policy approaches are far more realistic given that nothing happens without the approval of Congress.  Sanders could win with the young vote, but he'll lose them quickly when he can't deliver what he's promising.  And let's face it, he can't.  You can't pass M4A, Green New Deal, free/paid off college etc by Exec Order and getting those big $$ policies through Congress \"in 1 bite\" just won't happen.  Trump couldn't use an Exec Order to fund his wall, and Sanders can't use it for any of his policies either.  Winning is critical, but holding it in 2022/2024 is also important.

Back then it was humorous, but who's laughing these days? Bernie's right about most things, but governing and philosophizing are two different disciplines. I wish we could wrap our heads around not only health insurance plans, but along with that also work towards achieving the goal of healthy air, water, food, and a livable environment, instead of calling FEMA every few months to come and fix things up like they were before. Before the flood, the storm, the tornadoes, the draught, the fires, or a nasty strain of bacteria or a crippling virus sending people to the ER, all that \"stuff\" that stops us in our tracks. Then we could say the system we created works. We've got to make some huge changes, but for now we need to sell competence. Are you qualified for the job? And what about foreign policy? People get confused talking about abortion, school bathrooms, \"hordes\" of unwelcome foreigners trying to get in.\nAll distractions.",

Bernie may well win again in Iowa, but this is no guarantee he will become President Bernie.\n\nBut the real kicker is that not only may the 2020 Democratic primaries not mean much; the popular presidential election may not mean much once again.  Sadly, for 2 out of 5 presidential elections in the 21st century, the presidential candidate who won the popular election (Al Gore in 2000, Hillary Clinton in 2016) lost the Electoral College vote (to G.W. Bush and to D.J. Trump).\n\nSo, it looks like all we need to worry about is which Democratic candidates win in the swing states, which, for the 2020 election Five Thirty-Eight identifies as: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nNot really comforting, is it?",

Almost all those gains went to the <1%. This has gotten us protofascism, opioid crisis & Trump. (Almost certainly the MAGA crowd is pointing towards pre1973 America).

When Gore tacked to the right with Lieberman, or Hillary Kane, I knew then, they will lose! These candidates were conned by the same people today who wants to bring right wingers in the fold, the made their bed with Trump, let the GOP have them. To kowtow to corporate democrats, or the washed up GOP voters is to once again guarantee defeat.  \n\nWe have the best opportunity for America since FDR to restructure our toxic politics mainly because of election buying by evil plutocrats. This election is about Trump and Trumpisim not issues. Why not a candidate with policy fixes for every issue the democrats fought since FDR?  With women making 60% of the voters, isn\u2019t time, we elect a woman? \n\nWe can show America that a misogynous, bigoted, corrupt, treasonous president is soundly defeated by a strong, progressive, intelligent, compassionate no nonsense woman?

Senator Sanders has a decades-long record of advocating for the disenfranchised.  He has integrity and I trust that he will do his best to address climate change, ensure all Americans and residents have health insurance, access to free university and student loan forgiveness.  It is painful to read that your opinion writer will not vote for Sanders even when assessed as best option to defeat current administration.  I don't consider this responsible voting or journalism.  Senator Sanders deserves respect and to be treated with dignity rather than compared to an uncle in disparaging terms.  Disappointed by the Times!",

But even more so than Biden, conservatives have shown an affinity for Tulsi Gabbard. Her platform of non-interventionism appeals to voters for whom the cost of war was a very emotional issue in 2016, and remains so today. She speaks to conservatives in a way that doesn't make them feel like they're being looked down on, which is how they feel when addressed by Democrats such as Clinton and Harris (there's a reason why \"deplorables\" became a right-wing rallying call). She talks about faith the same way Christians do, even if she follows a different religion. The Washington Examiner has covered her campaign more extensively and favorably than CNN or MSNBC.\n\nBut instead of using this to their advantage, Dems have instead taken Gabbard's GOP support as an indicator of conspiracy and malice.  An antiwar coalition on the right should be seen as a major sign of progress, but instead it's treated as proof of Putin's maniacal influence. It blows my mind that Dems are throwing away an advantage like this when it's being handed directly to them.",

It's a Maslow's Hierarchy kind of thing.\n\nAnd, the economy is built on an immutable foundation of people's beliefs and emotions. The only reason it's doing so well now is because people believe that Trump won't insert the government and mess it up. People and businesses feel free to expand, spend, and generally act in a manner commensurate with a strong economy. Hence, the economy is strong.\n\nIt's basic economics: The economy is exactly as strong as people believe it is.\n\nBut, Bernie Sanders is a hardcore, true believing Communist. Two seconds (I'm being generous there) after he is elected, the economy will crash in such a way as to make 1929 look like a Sunday picnic in the park.\n\nSanders and Warren are unelectable, because voters perceive them to be a threat to the economy.

I also think a lot of Americans are in denial about their own anger, which can be manifested in vitriolic, personalized and sometimes inaccurate accusations against particular candidates.  I don't really trust someone who isn't passionate.  Obama was too slick, detached and superior by far, and Bill Clinton overplayed the good ol' Southern boy hand. What were sold to us as \"pragmatic\" policies, were essentially Republican policies.  Someone who comes across as above it all, probably is.  It's harder to get excited about promoting the status quo, particularly when you expect to gain from it personally.  Look at the millions of dollars the Clintons and Obamas have made off their so-called \"service\" post-presidency.  Something unseemly about that.

Also, there are expensive weapons that military leaders say they don't want or need, but similar, they are made in districts whose congressmen block their cancellation to bring home the bacon. Is this any way to run a budget? I assume that US treasury bondholders are not going to forgive future interest payments and that the US government will therefore be doing much less in the way of defense, infrastructure, education or anything else in part because of the above military spending mistakes.",

Not too surprised because in spite of running on a campaign of change \"Yes we can\", Obama, during his 8 years in office represented far too much of the establishment; from failing to make the 'banksters' pay for their part in the financial collapse, to his support of more global trade deals (TPP) which for many of those in the rust belt who lost their jobs and industries, this was symbolic of Democrats shipping more jobs overseas.  Everyone blames Hillary as being unappealing to a large section of the voters, but the actions of Obama (or lack thereof) contributed just as much or even more to voter disaffection in 2016.  Many in the Democratic party think that going back to the Obama days (in the form of Biden) would be attractive to more voters.  But I believe that this is not likely the case, as it was the lack of change by Democrats that was at the heart of Trump's victory.  Having said all that, I do acknowledge the introduction of Obamacare as a great step forward, but the next step should be to expand it not  just fiddle around the edges.  Obama's opinion holds sway with a sizable portion of the Black vote, so any public endorsement of any candidate matters a lot. It is particularly damaging to Sanders and Warren who are struggling to capture the Black vote.  \nOne final point; if Sander and Warren attack each other their supporters will be split, reducing either's chances.",

Australia is in the process of burning to the ground; California is not far behind; and we haven't even begun to worry about our major coastal cities that will soon be under water as glaciers rapidly melt and sea levels rise.

While Trump is a huge part of the problem, the Democrats, despite all the lip-service to the Green New Deal, have yet to \"put their money where their mouths are.\"",

I know that he is a little late to the party, but better late than never. Trump is going to run on the economy, and the only one who can beat him on that is Mr. Bloomberg ! A true self made billionaire, who is on the right side of all the progressive issues that Democrats want. \nI like Mike !!",

But today's awful political climate is ultimately driven by economic fear.  Trump is the backlash to years of inequality, and it's not going to stop, so let's backlash with Bernie and get something useful out of it. The whole country, business included, will benefit from a national health insurance solution, improved food security, and aggressive climate change policy. In this political system with its gerrymandered Koch-sponsored Republican candidates, we have to have someone as radical as Bernie to eventually get us to where Buttigieg and Klobuchar want to start.

I hate his cozy relationship with credit card companies and the massive funds he gets from pharma and oil and all the other corporate interests that we need to be fighting. I hate how he thinks his son getting more money in a year than average people earn in a lifetime to be on the board or a foreign natural gas company is just fine, nothing to worry about. I hate how he has Democrats saying that if that kinda corruption isn't illegal, it must be fine. \n\nI hate how his bellicose nature and coziness with big business represents neoliberalism, but he tries to sell himself as Amtrak Joe. And I hate how so many Democrats ignore all his shortcomings, as they did with Hillary.\n\nBut mostly, I hate him for an interview clip I saw in which he completely dismissed the concerns of young people by saying, \"Give me a break.\" He talked about how hard his generation had it because of Kent State, completely ignoring Columbine and Virginia Tech and Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas high. Study after shows how young people have lower incomes than his generation at that age, more debt, higher costs for healthcare and housing, and less accumulated wealth. And Biden acts like a Boomer stereotype talking about whiny entitlef millennials.",

This is the official Sanders myth, based on the fact that during his 12 years in the House had 17 amendments he had authored pass the House by roll call vote. The first time I heard about this, it seemed fantastic. Over 90% of House members never ever author even one amendment that goes to a full roll call vote, much less that passes. Sanders has bragged about this for decades. \nOnly recently did I research what had really happened, starting with the frequently cited (including by Sanders supporters, who seem not to have read it all) Rolling Stones article that called Sanders the King of Amendments. The point of that article was that committees still ruled the legislative process, and that NOT ONE of Sander's amendments ever made it into the bills passed by the House. They passed because everybody in the House knew they were just grandstanding, and meant nothing. In fact, sometimes Sanders traded his critical procedural votes in committee for these nothingburger amendments.",

The US are the only country in the world that can effectively tax its rich due to citizenship based taxation and FATCA, Obama's biggest achievement nobody has heard of\n\n2. The poor and people with little marketable talents deserve our solidarity. So do those who took a wrong step or have gotten ill. Our lives are heavily influenced by those around us. Stop telling people they choose to be poor, it's really not pretty. \n\n3. Education is the foundation of advanced societies. We need to get more people into college. We could also use good trade schools like in Germany. The quality of plumbers, roofers, builders, ... here is often dreadful.\n\n4. Money in politics is toxic. It's a form of legal bribery, designed to obtain a favor that goes against the general interest.\nReplacing Citizens United should be the number one concern if Democrats can win the trifecta.\n\n5. GDP is not everything. European countries could increase theirs easily by cutting their typical 20 to 35 days of paid holidays in half like here in the US. Not worth it. \n\nThese things are covered by Warren and Bernie. Bernie would gain more votes in rural America but lose more in the cities, so probably has the best chance.

The economy is a disaster waiting to implode because of Trump and the GOP's climate denial. Check out the fires in Australia, floods and fires in the USA, the fact that Venice is sinking and it may not be possible to save one of the most beautiful cities on earth. Where is the money going to come from to face the reality of climate change? And if Trump denies human causes, and his fossil fuel supporters agree with him, Stephen's also seems to be in agreement if he thinks climate change will go away without bankrupting the economy which, like most of Trump's policies, is a wall of lies. Sanders claims he is an environmentalist but after you add up the costs of his Magic Wand programs every American will have to turn their paycheck over to President Sanders and hope he will pay their rent and food bills and anything else because the citizenry will be drowning in debt. Warren has already toned down her policies and is flexible enough to realize reality is a president can only sign or veto bills proposed by Congress no matter how much the president has \u201cplans.\u201d Warren Booker or Warren Castro will be the ticket that replaces the orange gorgon in the oval office.",

Given that: is it really your position that if you lived in a state in which your vote actually mattered, you would throw away your ballot on a third-party candidate? To paraphrase your 2016 position: the republic will survive a far-left Bernie, who would have minimal chances of getting any of his big ideas enacted--it likely will not survive four more years of the kind of disruption we are likely to see from this president, who would be unconstrained by any political considerations.

Yet this was a period of heady prosperity and economic expansion and also of relative income equality and domestic tranquility. Some view it as the American Golden Age. Sanders's tax the wealthy plan is quite minimal compared to Eisenhower's,  but by today's prevailing Plutocratic standards, which Bret seems to have absorbed into his DNA, it's a bridge, way, way, way too far to cross.",

Maybe readers of the NY Times know the answer to this conundrum.\n\nThere are two positions on illegal immigration and many other positions which are in between or more extreme.\n\n1.  One might favor open borders.\n\n2.  One might favor humane treatment of illegal immigrants, but more restrictions on immigration intended to keep the US population from growing further, coupled with aid to foreign countries (such as Guatemala) which have suffered immensely because of too much population growth.\n\nThe problem with the first policy is that it is based upon innumeracy.  Population of Guatemala has quadrupled since 1960.  Currently, Guatemalan population is increasing by about 350,000 per year.  Thus we need to  inaccept 350,000 immigrants per year JUST FROM GUATEMALA to keep up with population growth.\n\nThe result of open borders is likely to be no universal health care for the foreseeable future even if one confiscates the wealth of the billionaires.  Try to confiscate the wealth and the stock market would likely fall destroying the wealth before it is collected.  And cashing in stock certificates does not immediately provide the trained doctors one needs to provide universal health care.\n\nIn other words, open borders is inconsistent with addressing the other problems America faces, the increase in homelessness and despair.",

There is nothing about Trump's nomination, election victory and presidency that even resembles the norms of a democratic republic. On the contrary, everything about Trump screams dysfunction and destruction of those norms.\n\nIn this scenario why in the world would you use a standard political measuring device --- such as policy positions --- to assess who would make the best candidate and who you would vote for?

That's it. Nothing else matters, not health care, the climate, college debt, immigration, the Middle East, income inequality, none of it. Because if Trump is re-elected because of an irrational fear of anything that has anything to do with anything other than getting Trump out of the White House.....?\n\nIf you think these past 4 years have been a disaster, wait until he's a lame duck president with nothing to lose.",

His positions would not have surprised President Eisenhower, who said, in fact, that anyone who does not accept New Deal programs doesn\u2019t belong in the American political system. That\u2019s now considered very radical.\"\n\n\"The other interesting aspect of Sanders\u2019s positions is that they\u2019re quite strongly supported by the general public, and have been for a long time. That\u2019s true on taxes. It\u2019s true on healthcare....So, you go back, say, to the Reagan years, about 70 percent of the population thought that national healthcare should be in the Constitution, because it\u2019s such an obvious right. And, in fact, about 40 percent of the population thought it was in the Constitution, again, because it\u2019s such an obvious right. The same is true on tax policy and others.\"\n\n\"So we have this phenomenon where someone is taking positions that would have been considered pretty mainstream during the Eisenhower years, that are supported by a large part, often a considerable majority, of the population, but he\u2019s dismissed as radical and extremist. \"\nthe wisdom of Noam Chomsky- 2016",

The only people who would be paying more in taxes would be those who can afford them. The definition of the middle class has moved over the years. Most surveys show the top 10 percent of families have incomes of $100,000 a year. I imagine this bracket compares itself to the ultra wealthy and feels insecure. But any increase in taxes would be more than outweighed by increased social stability. Healthcare inflation is up for all people, and this is one of Bernie's main issues. Additionally, fear of taxation often encourages money to move to more productive purposes, which would spur investment. I don't think modifying defense spending would make much of a difference tactically because the Pentagon always gets its money, whether it's on the books or not.  Remember that $21 trillion the DoD couldn't account for last year? Or the trillions announced missing in 2001?",

For a more severe reality check, visit small town America or the rural counties. Chat with the business person from Texas on your next airport layover. Just ask some open ended questions about how they would like to see the election go and why. You will not see a stereotype, but you will understand how differently middle America views the world. Many books have been written on the astonishing election of Trump and his continuing popularity. These books come to life when you have a casual conversation with someone who voted for him. Many are appalled by the recklessness of the president, but support his policies. I live in a blue city in a red state that is changing very fast and is becoming purple as younger and Latino voters become politically active, but I have no illusions that Senator Sanders has any chance here whatsoever outside of cities like Austin. We have seen this before when Al Gore and Hillary Clinton lost as left leaning voters did not line up for the \"establishment\" candidate. Will the party repeat this process?",

Can Bernie also draw out young voters who usually don't vote? If the polls are half-way right, yes. Will Bernie lose some moderate never-Trump Republicans that proclaim they will never vote for a Democratic Socialist? Probably. But they will have to contemplate that staying home or voting 3rd party is a vote for 4 more years of Trump and may very well be offset by Millennial enthusiasm. On paper, Bernie can win. Reality will depend on him bringing the right weapon to the fight and be willing and able to push back against the Russian Facebook onslaught that is coming.

In the latter economic model, if a company succeeds in selling dubious claims about the virtue of their products to members of Congress this can short-circuit the desire of consumers.

            "comment_body": "A note to Mr. Stephens and other conservative friends who believe Trump should not be re-elected, but are willing to vote only for some of the Democratic candidates and stay home otherwise: In a close election, not voting or voting for a third party candidate is effectively voting for the eventual winner of the poll. Assume candidates A & B are running, and you don't vote because you don't like either of them, but if you had to choose you would vote for candidate B. If A gets 1000 more votes than B, but there were 2000 voters like that who would choose B. By not voting this block has effectively elected A. If they go out and vote, B wins and they have elected B. In either case they will pick the winner. So let's say Warren becomes the Democratic nominee, you have to be honest with yourself and pick 4 more years of Trump or 4 years of warren, hold your nose and go out and vote! \n\nHere's another thing to consider. If Bernie or Warren win, they won't be able to enact their agenda unless they have a supermajority in Senate and can overcome all legal challenges hurled at them (Obamacare is still in legal jeopardy). But if Trump wins he will be absolutely unhinged and feels free to do whatever comes to his mind at any time. Scary thought!",

Sure, the stock market has done well, but most people don't own any stocks. It's great for the professional/investor class, but everyone else just has to watch because out there in the real world economic conditions are NOT very promising:\n\n- Most Americans don't have enough saved for retirement, and a shocking amount have NO savings at all. \n- Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. \n- Most Americans wouldn't be able to cover a $500 emergency without taking on debt. \n\nForget the Trump tax cut. It isn't aimed at anyone but the already-rich, but even if it WERE more calibrated to the masses, potentially saving a few points on your taxes makes no material difference when the day-to-day experience of life is so strained by scarcity and debt. Is it any surprise why Bernie, with an agenda/vision that marks a clear departure from the status quo that got us here, has a ton of support? He has by far the most dedicated and diverse coalition behind him; all the other Dems play to a fungible niche that would shift to any other Dem if need be.",

Since these conservatives are now almost all gone, Bret sees 'moderation' in the rightward tilt; the aftermath of his 'conservative revolution.'",

If Trump's record will make people turn away from the Republican Party then Sanders' angry, narrow, ideological - and yes, undemocratic - stand will make people turn away from the Democratic Party.   Sanders has done much damage to the Democratic Party already.  It is one thing to win -- all you have to do is get people hyped up and to the voting booth.  It is an entirely different thing to govern.  I agree with much of Sanders' diagnoses of what ails us.  I do not agree with either his methods or his solutions and I find the people who support him scary -- filled with a romantic zeal and rage.   We did not get to this place in one administration and we will not get out of it in one administration.  At least not as long as long as Fox News and their ilk are around.

Is Iowa representative of the American electorate or just the presidential primary state with the earliest caucus/vote? We know what Trump would do in his attack on Sanders and Warren. Biden is certainly not bulletproof against Trump's attacks, regardless of how contrived they will be, but face to face would make Donnie look like the bully that he is. Biden/Klobuchar or Biden/Booker seem more capable of winning those states that will decide the election. Moreover, Sanders would decline Bloomberg's financial support and that would put him at an even bigger disadvantage than the labels that Trump and his minions would paint on Bernie. Those labels stick in crucial states.\n\nThe electorate is far more moderate than Sanders or Warren and average people have had it with tax increases. The DNC should get real and not make the same mistake it did in 2016. It needs to be pragmatic. \n\nFinally, my choice would be Bloomberg for a long list of practical reasons, not least is that he could command media with a cogent anti-Trump message, both social and mass with acumen and far more money than Trump. In office Bloomberg could address crucial problems persuasively.  While he is not touchy feely like some of the other Democratic candidates, he seems a decent person. The fact that he is really a Republican should give him an edge with Trumpers away from the MAGA madness crowd.",

He has awoken a gigantic number of young people: 75% of all Democratic-voters under age 50 voted for Bernie Sanders 2016. Young people spread out across the USA over the summer of 2018, registering new voters. As a result, voters age 18 to 29 increased participation in Midterms 2019 by 200%! Bernie Sanders is endorsed as the BEST to handle climate change by the youthful \"Sunshine Movement.\" He's also endorsed by a coalition of #Progressive organizations working in states like Florida to boost on-the-ground support. Sanders' supporters have also launched an organization called #OurRevolution, which provides social media support and funding for \"Berniecrats,\"  who are taking on \"establishment\" \"centralist\" Democrats in the primaries! Sanders has a massive database of monthly supporters, which includes millions of voters willing to go with him to Washington DC to PUSH THE AGENDA. Because, as Senator Sanders says at every rally of 30,000, \"Power does not concede without a fight. It will take tens of millions of voters insisting on systemic change in order to take back our government from the Oligarchy.\"",

All frightened Americans have their doots that he'll be fit in any way to run after his Senate Trial maybe starting this week.

All but one: Reducing income inequality. \n\nMortensen's careful study and regression analysis predicts that if virtually all of Canada's gun control policies are applied in the US, each one's effect on our gun homicide rate will, counter-intuitively cause an INCREASE, rather than a decrease.  So why is Canada's rate so much lower than ours?  Only one factor was statistically significant at lowering gun violence and homicide.  Despite a lower median income, Canada's income inequality rate is so much lower that it overcame ALL the other negatives.  \n\nMortensen extrapolated the effect on gun homicides if the US lowered its income inequality to Canada's rate.  The result was STUNNING! Of the roughly 16,000 gun homicides (non-suicides) in 2017, all  but roughly 1,000 would be eliminated!  (he didn't study the effect on suicides--24,000 by guns, 23,000 by other means but it's reasonable to suppose similar reductions.) \n\nSo Bernie Sanders' \"cure-all\"--solving income inequality, would be THE best way to reduce gun violence after all!\n\n<a href=\"https://zachmortensen.net/2018/02/20/your-gun-control-ideas-wont-work-this-one-will\" target=\"_blank\">https://zachmortensen.net/2018/02/20/your-gun-control-ideas-wont-work-this-one-will</a>/",

He also ceded leadership authority to Congress. He never told Congress what bill to write. He asked them to present a bill for signature.\n\nIn all their misguided wisdom, Congress held out hope for a bipartisan bill that Republicans universally rejected no matter what the concession. See the point about not actually having a super majority. Then Ted Kennedy died, Sam Brown won, and we ended up with budget reconciliation.\n\nThis paved the way for Trump's tax cut bill. A law which passed through reconciliation with made up budget numbers and 51 votes. Times have changed Mr. Stephens. You no longer need 60 votes to pass sweeping legislation. You need 50 votes, the White House, and a budget justification. Sanders would likely have all three.\n\nBare in mind millennials feel the same way about moderates as Bret does about socialists. However, if you take them to the polls, they tend to vote down the ticket. That means an enthusiastic turnout behind Sanders will likely deliver House and Senate majorities.

But the Colorado River could not have cut the canyon in 6000 years.  So I rejected creationism.\n\nThen I went to the university.  And I found that the sciences made sense but not so much the social sciences.\n\nIn particular, macroeconomics appeared fraudulent.  (Not microeconomics of course.)\n\nThe reason was the models were based upon human behavior.  People could choose to disobey the economic rules.  That's different from the planets which are FORCED to follow Newtonian mechanics.\n\nAnd the statistics used by economists seem fraudulent.  Take GDP for example.  It doesn't include the effects of global warming which may drive humans to extinction!\n\nSo why does the wealth tax look fraudulent?  Because it imagines that the wealth of billionaires can be transformed into medical care.\n\nThe famous painting Salvator Mundi by Leonardo sold for $450 million at auction.\n\nBut how do you transform that into medical care?  Wouldn't the price fall?\n\nThe stock market is now in bubble territory.  Isn't there a danger that a wealth tax (if implemented) would lead to a market crash, preventing the wealth from being collected?",

Iowans are able to hear candidates in person, not mediated, and they aren't keen on going with the group. Whether by accident or not, they seem to gravitate towards the ideal approach: thinking for themselves.\n\nThe founding parents of the US Constitution debated whether a big country could be democratic, when historical examples were city-states. Madison argued that size was good, because isolated groups would cancel each other's special interests. Sort of worked. But there's still something to be said for smaller populations doing democracy.

Who's more fired up? The young activists in Bernie's camp, in districts like AOC's and on campus? Or the AWFULs and aspiring AWFULs in all of those pricey gentrified zip codes and well heeled burbs? Or will there be a large showing of the soft middle?  \n\nMy guess is Bernie takes Iowa and NH, based on a state-wide lack of AWFULs and large numbers of his type. Even more will turn out after what Liz just did to him, too. But in the end, we're probably looking at a brokered convention. Definitely a Trump win.",

Actually, that's how the smaller parties in the United States such as the Libertarian Party operate.\n\nRegistered members of political parties (not voters registered with a party) should convene to pick party leaders, including candidates for public offices. Political parties should represent a platform and candidates from those parties should be chosen to present that platform to the voters.\n\nThe primary system has had its day. Voters would be better served by parties choosing their candidates at conventions designed for that purpose, just as was once was done in the United States and still does occur in Europe.",

So it will be with Iowa this year. Most Democratic candidates seem to be running in hopes of being chosen Vice President or to a Cabinet position, or maybe to gain recognition that will be useful in four years. Anybody not finishing in the top five in Iowa will lose those possibilities. It will be similar in New Hampshire. \nToday there are four Democratic candidates who in Iowa and nationwide consistently favored by 10 to 25 percent of the electorate, in most recent polls more like 15 to 20 percent. The rest score less than 5 percent, but there are so many of them that their total number of supporters is significant.

If the polls are accurate, you're looking at a four-way race through New Hampshire at least. Iowa will serve to knock practically everyone else out of the race. However the basic primary mechanics won't change. Sanders, Biden, Warren, Buttigieg.\n\nYou can imagine a scenario where Warren or Buttigieg unexpectedly fails to hit 15 percent. However, probably not both. You'd end up with a three-way race with one side or the other consolidated. In that sense, Iowa could decide the primary again. The consolidated side would have a clear path to victory. Only the 3rd candidate dropping out would make the race competitive again.\n\nBloomberg might make Iowa irrelevant though. Assuming at least a relatively split Iowan vote, Bloomberg challenges whichever establishment candidate that survives. Even if Biden manages to knock Buttigieg out of the race or vice versa, establishment Democrats still enter Super Tuesday with a split ticket. If both candidates survive, there will be a three-way split.\n\nProgressives really only need a consistent showing in both Iowa and New Hampshire. One candidate against the establishment. The path from there is relatively clear. At the moment, that candidate looks like Sanders. However, I'm beginning to sense hostility from the Warren camp.

Who saw that coming?  And you think you can predict -- or worse, control -- the outcome of the next election?  \n\nOne lesson worth learning from the right, though, is their commitment to their \"ideals\" (such as they are).  You don't hear folks on the right struggling over who can win.  They pick the person they like.  Period.  They don't  wring their hands over who people on the left might like.  They don't choose the person who will most satisfy their political opponents.  From a political perspective, picking Trump was stupid.  There was no way he would win.  But they picked him, anyway, just because they liked him.  And here we are.  \n\nThe Dems do exactly the opposite.  I have heard more people than I can count -- a lot of them women -- tell me they like Warren, but don't think a woman can win, so they will vote for Biden.  I have yet to talk to anyone who actually thinks Biden would be a good president.  If everyone who actually prefers Warren would just vote for her, she would run away with it.\n\nNominating the person you think your opponent will like rather than the person you like is the surest path to losing.  Republicans are not going to choose a moderate Dem in the general.  They are going to choose the Republican.",

The policies she advocates will cost many trillions, and most economists seem to agree that her projected revenues won't pay for them.  All she says is that they are \"wrong\".  Despite her Oklahoma roots and thousands of selfies, Warren comes off as elitist and preachy, issuing diktats that were incubated in refined Harvard public policy circles.

They then end their comments by saying that if someone like Bernie is the nominee, they will just stay home.\n\nFunny how they don't see the hypocrisy or criticizing Sanders or Warren voters for wanting their candidate to have big bold ideas, yet then take a petulant stand if that person is the nominee. Also just because these rightwing Centrist may know only like minded people, who also hate Bernie, doesn't mean that everyone does. It just means that in that person's small circle, this is the case. Yet they'll never admit that because they think only they are right,an attitude they accuse Sanders' supporters of having.\n\nFinally they rant that  Sanders isn't even a Democrat, although he caucuses with the Democrats and votes with the Democrats, except when he wants more progressive bills passed. Isn't Bernie, with his ideals, more like FDR, than Manchin or West Virginia, who often votes against the environment and with Trump or the Congressman from Chicago, who is against any and all abortions, and votes accordingly. What makes them more of a Democrat than Sanders?",

In fact in probably 80% - 85% of the states everyone already knows who the winner will be. \n\nThis election, like the last one, will not be someone that \"unites\" the party at the nation level, but rather will be won by whomever takes that small handful of swing states that are in play. So the real question is - who can win them?\n\nAnd in that respect, I'm not sure Warren is all that strong. The winner will need states in particular in the south east, and northern Midwest. Michigan? Usually solidly Democratic, in fact every election since 1992 - until Trump. She'd need it back. \n\nBut it has unionization levels above the national norm, many of who's members have really good medical benefits from labor negotiations. Unions play a huge roll in the day to day work of organizing and getting out the vote - and telling them they are going to toss out their hard won benefits and just participate in medicare for all is not exactly the way to enthuse them.\n\nJust an example - point is, \"who can unite the national party\" is an irrelevant question. \"Who can win the swing states\" is the only question that matters.",

In that country, there is a right wing coalition that includes a large mainline Conservative party (Likud), and a number of smaller religious and nationalistic parties.  The problem there is that none of the individual parties can win enough votes to govern on its own, and so there is a period of horse trading after each election in order to cobble together the majority coalition needed to govern.\n\nWhere we differ from Israel is that the political horse trading takes place before the election by way of the primary and caucus system.  One way to look at Clinton\u2019s defeat in 2016 is as an inability to build the required governing coalition.  She just couldn\u2019t get one or two tiny parties to sign on.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with partisan factionalism prior to the convention.  I\u2019d argue that having a transparent period of political horse trading is a good thing for democracy.  That horse trading serves to moderate extreme candidates who seek leadership as they strive to accommodate the various groups they\u2019ll need to govern if they win.  The good thing is that because the coalition building happens before the election, we all have a better idea of what policies we\u2019ll get if our candidates win.",

Bad politics, both strategically and morally.              \n     For a triggered Ms. Goldberg it re-ignites the absurd Bernie Bros lie that was used to put the kibosh on Sanders in 2016 when the DNC had actually fought tirelessly to upend his campaign. \nMs. Goldberg might take note that Sanders stayed to the  bitter end in that campaign  because his ideas were relevant to millions of voters and gave Americans more than a few new ideas by which to navigate the future as well as an actual option to business as usual.                                                              \n      I've always been supportive of Elizabeth Warren and up till this moment, she may well have been my choice on the primary ballot. But this ploy (and it is a ploy) to co opt the progressive platform by throwing Sanders under the bus using a private and unwitnessed conversation as evidence of anti-female sentiment is not only contemptible but laughable in the context of Goldberg's  dubbing of Warren as a \"Unity Candidate\".",

Although, it might me more accurate to say that the  Republican Party had an establishment wing and a populous wing because the latter has taken over the party. The populous wing of the Democratic Party is also trying to take over but it appears without success at the moment as the establishment wing continues to have broad support. I would say Warren is part of the populous wing that appeared as a result of the economic crash of 2008 and was manifested as the Occupy Wall Street movement. This movement morphed into the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2016. It has now been divided between Sanders and Warren with Sanders maintaining the purists and Warren being backed by those who are a little more pragmatic. Both wings of the Democratic Party should leave the convention untied for the sake of keeping US democracy intact if nothing else but strong emotions may make that impossible.",

As an important side note, I have an advanced degree in women and gender studies, and have been thrilled by Warren's rise in the party. In contrast, I held my nose to vote for Hilary Clinton because her brand of \"feminism\" historically excluded women of color here and abroad. Today, I am outraged about the Politico and CNN smear campaign against Sanders. The man fought for women's and queer rights while Hilary Clinton was rallying for Berry Goldwater, and Elizabeth Warren was a Republican. I understand that people can evolve and change. However, the media has to as well. Yes Sander's aids may have suggested that Warren's base is far whiter, wealthier, and more traditional than his base. That is factually accurate and the data bears that reality. It says a lot when Warren coffee mugs are being sold in the Hamptons last summer, while the disdain for Sander's working class antics are still visceral among the New England elite. Bernie Sanders is being fueled by Gen X, millennial, and Gen Z women of color, school teachers, the women led Sunrise Movement, and the largest nurses union in the nation.

She writes that she will vote for any of the democrats but will pull the lever for Warren with joy.\nThat is what sets Elizabeth Warren apart from all of the rest; she campaigns with such joy.  She is \"tickled pink\" to be with all of the people; proposing a new way forward; taking selfies; answering questions. When she says she has a plan for that she doesn't seem to be patting herself on the back as much as letting US all in on a secret.\nt rump won in 2016 by the very slimmest of margins and was elected by people who really didn't know who he was.  He did not have a track record outside of NYC, apart from the fictional track record on the Apprentice.\nHe now has a track record that includes letting children die in cages, letting Puerto Rico fend for itself, insulting our allies, turning his back on state sponsored murder by Putin and MBS, and failure to revive the coal and manufacturing jobs.\nThat might not move his very base base, but moderates who took a chance in '16 seem plenty turned off by his evil ways.\nMy optimism took a new turn when I read that Bloomberg will spend his money to defeat t rump even if he is not the nominee.   Even if that nominee is Sanders or Warren.\nLet's take back our Country.",

The most true thing I've heard about her came from (of all people) Anthony Scaramucci during an appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher. Scaramucci said if Warren gets the nomination, \"Trump wins 40 out of 50 states.\" In response, there was much derisive laughter and dismissiveness (troublingly similar to what anyone got who suggested Hillary wasn't a slam dunk) -- but I haven't forgotten those words for the simple reason that when push comes to shove moderate Democrats will protect their money above all else. For all they say publicly, in the privacy of the voting booth they will swallow their queasiness and pull the lever for Trump.  Biden is not an ideal candidate by any stretch, but he is our only hope to beat Trump, and the others need to get behind him and quick.  I only wish Barack Obama would get all the Democratic candidates in a room and tell Amy and Pete, their time will come, but it's not now, and tell Bernie and Liz that there's too much at stake and they have to take one for the team.",

Many wealthy earned their success contributing to the betterment of society. Liz needs to better communicate that she understands the balance of capitalism and socialism whereas Bernie is a pure socialist and is angry with anyone who opposes him. Liz is a healthy 70 years old which in male life span calculous makes her 55 compared to Bernie and Biden (think dog years). She also looks forward not back. I'd love to have a beer with Joe but he isn't my choice. Liz needs to adopt Pete's position on UH and let a full coverage one payer system compete against a private system. The one payer system will win every time. Insurance frictional cost is unnecessary. Insurance is to protect against risk. The large numbers involved in HC creates the ability to accurately predict costs therefore there is no risk in funding the insured group. That is why virtually every enterprise in the U.S. with over 500 employees \"self-insures\" completely or at a high level as the frictional cost of insurers profit, administration and loss of decision control are unnecessary and poor business practice.",

He, also, seems to want to turn the clock back a generation or three. Warren and Sanders are vying for the same demographic with nearly identical platforms, but, of the two, Warren seems a little more pragmatic. Her explanation of how to pay for universal healthcare was dodgy, but her admission that it couldn\u2019t be enacted in toto and immediately was refreshing. Klobuchar would be a little on the status quo side, but she is honest and it\u2019s kind of amazing that she has had such staying power. What to think of Buttigieg escapes me and I don\u2019t believe he can garner broad appeal. The rest of the pack are non-starters. IMHO, billionaires should use their money to pay their employees living wages and take less compensation for themselves and shareholders, instead of trying to run the whole show. It speaks volumes about their egos. Whatever happens, the main goal ought to be restoring the presidency to the people and ridding our government of his enablers(Mitch, Lindsey and the rest).

This Orwellian two-step is reported with exactly zero objective scrutiny by multiple news media outlets.\n4) On the same day, in the same news cycle, Warren accuses Sanders of saying, in a private 1 on 1 meeting in 2018, that he doesn't think a woman can win.

If every person in America who could vote, did vote, no Republican (at least in their current personification), would win.The fight here is between the Democratic nominee and their voters.  Who can get the majority of Democratic leaning voters to go to the polls and vote?  There were several African American or Hispanic candidates.  Now there are none.  Why?  Because they couldn't garner enough support even among their own race.  Why is that?  The fact that African Americans overwhelmingly support an old white fuddy duddy like Biden tells you all you need to know.  Corey and Kamala must be just shaking their heads, wondering how this all happened.  Even when a Black guy was in the White House, Black Americans still were on the back burner at the end of 8 Obama years.  They have been on the outs their entire lives.  They are used to it. So the only way to get something, anything for their vote is to join'em rather than beat 'em. They are smart enough to figure that one out. All the Republicans have to do is offset the slight increase in enthusiasm by minorities with suppression of an equal number of votes.  So, Mike Bloomberg, if what you really want is the Democrat to win, put that billion dollars toward getting people out to vote.  They don't need to hear Trump is terrible for them.They aren't stupid.  They just  need help registering and rides to the polls.",

Most voters have no idea Sanders ran for office three times as a candidate for a party that supported abolishing the entire US Military and guarding the country with the Coast Guard.  Please Michelle, if Bernie wins Iowa and THEN is vetted, his supporters will howl that Saint Bernie is being undermined.  If he wins the nomination, Trump and the GOP will show no mercy.  ALL the other major Dem candidates have had their past mistakes and positions raked over the coals.  Take off the gloves with this Socialist Sacred Cow before it's too late for Liz Warren, the Democrats and the USA.",

She amassed considerable wealth advocating on behalf of her clients against individuals, including coal miners, who'd brought suit against them.  \n\nTo her credit, she brought her legal skills to the Democratic Party where she was particularly effective as a consumer advocate. In 2005, she humiliated Joe Biden during a Senate Banking and Finance Committee hearing on bankruptcy reform which he opposed.  In the last debate, she and Buttigieg engaged in mutual gotcha confrontation over big bucks fund raising only to be silenced by Sanders whose campaign is solely funded by small donations.

Not thrilled about her disclosing information that was private and apparently confidential to damage Sanders, either. Perhaps she was reacting to what Ms Goldberg called obnoxious behavior on the part of Sanders' campaign, but justifying obnoxious behavior because the other guy did it is, again, politics as usual. And I'm not sure Hillary was the aggrieved party in the 2016 nomination battle. The DNC clearly favored Clinton (people lost their jobs over the bias). Who knows if Sanders would have beaten Trump? But the perception that the party influenced the fact he didn't get the opportunity to challenge him was responsible, as much as anything, for a less-than-enthusiastic embrace of Clinton by the progressive wing of the party.  Sanders is surging among progressives because he just looks like a more authentic representative of those ideals right now. Warren is responsible for that.",

Warren and Sanders more clearly appeal to the progressive left, while Biden and Buttigieg appeal to the center-left.\n\nWhere the progressives fall down is (1) on the lack of widespread appeal of progressive ideology, in particular in swing states, and (2) the actual value of turning out more Blue voters in already Blue states.  \n\nI know the progressives here will take umbrage with these points and it's very early to be making predictions, but I can't help but keep going back to the fact that Bernie's support is consistent but he's never polled above 26% support among Democrats, let alone ALL VOTERS, and Warren's campaign is flagging thanks to her gaffes on M4A and campaign donations from corporations.

We will swallow our pride and vote for Warren if we have to, but the crucial ideological differences between her and Bernie are apparent to us. They only seem illusory or unimportant to the pundit class because they don't understand the vision of the movement that supports Bernie. Finally, her political instincts are terrible, her campaign is poorly run, she has made countless unforced errors, and she stands to lose against Trump whereas Bernie actually has a shot. Disappointing but not unexpected take from the Op-Ed page.",

And so did the media including the NY Times. The Democratic Party is split between the centrist and leftist sectors. The centrists and monied interests were threatened by Sanders determination to confront corporatists and big money and backed Hillary with a vengeance.  In fact the Democrats needed the money she brought in and were frightened to lose it. So they chose Hillary and it worked to some extent. She won the popular vote but not the electoral college and so now we have what we have.  But perhaps the charisma of Donald Trump might have been better matched by the charisma of Bernie whose populist agenda is actually real while Trump's is not. Maybe the people are waking up to the fact that the people have been duped by Dems who give voice to genuine concerns but who are stymied by the moneys they depend on.

Who does Goldberg support? Warren!!! Can you imagine Goldberg's dudgeon if she were to discover that someone, for example AOC, had a financial conflict of interest underlying their support for Bernie? \n\nThe rest of the Op-Ed is simply ludicrous. We have to rely on Goldberg's word that \"in much of the Democratic Party, there\u2019s tremendous resentment of Sanders left over from 2016. Many believe he weakened Hillary Clinton by dragging out the primary...\"\n\nAu contraire, madame Warren supporter! The evidence shows that it was Hillary, aided and abetted by Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and the DNC, who weakened Bernie by suppressing his campaign and favoring Hillary. In fact, polls showed that Hillary could NOT beat Trump but Bernie could, and there was lots of pressure on Hillary to drop out. \n\nI'm sure you would agree, Michelle, that revealing your conflict does not mitigate it. We'll remember this next time you critique others for their conflicts. Goldberg now shares the same boat with the Trump family, accused of pursuing their own interests because they have conflicts. \n\nNothing against Warren: I would vote for her. But, my first choice will be Bernie. And no one in my family works for him.",

FiveThiryEight only gives her a 12% chance of winning 1/2 of the delegates needed to win the primary, whereas Biden is at 40% and Sanders is at 22%.\n\nFinally, comes the much maligned but still important issues of \"likability\" and \"electability\".  Folks can crow about these concepts at their own peril, but voters don't elect campaigns, they elect Leaders and here Warren lags her peers.

This just continues the stealth attacks on Sanders by the MSM and the NYT. Hilary Clinton lost because she ran a poor campaign, and gave the impression that she was above the \"common folk\", and many of those folk went and voted for Trump rather than her. And I think it's dishonest of the NYT to foment divisiveness between two candidates that they would rather not see get the nomination.\n\nAs for Liz being the \"unity candidate\", while she may be able to attract a lot of support across the spectrum - now that Bernie made former \"radical\" ideas like MFA and taxing the rich and GND almost mainstream-polls show her NOT drawing in the voters that switched from Obama to Trump. Moreover she doesn't seem to inspire the passion that Sanders (or Yang or Buttigieg) seem to inspire. This is the aspect of her that Sanders campaign was highlighting, and I don't think it's off base. \n\nPersonally I like Warren a lot, second only to Bernie, and wouldn't be unhappy if she got the nomination.

To ignore or diminish the excitement and support of another female candidate is repugnant and does smell of his halfhearted 'endorsement' of Clinton in 2016. \n\nI understand he wants to win a primary and for that, he has to draw differences with other candidates. Maybe if he had more detailed policy proposals and got them on the record in interviews, he could draw differences with Warren on a substantive level. So far, he has not articulated how he would attempt to execute his platform and maybe now that he can be seen as a 'frontrunner', the media will finally hold him to account for that.",

Some voters resent that and some whom Warren might otherwise have attraced will vote elsewhere instead. Sad but true, and unfortunately probably especially applicable to swing voters in swing states.\n\nWarren has added much of value to the presidential debates this season, and to national dialogues in general, would be valuable continuing in the Senate, and a good choice for a prominent cabinet position.",

To reach this goal, the new system will have to reduce profits for health providers, pharmaceutical companies and eliminate the current system of private health insurance. \nWhat Americans want is to be able to choose their doctor. Medicare, which already exists shows us how to reach that goal.\nSo, the health care industry has started to fight back arguing that it is about choice, confusing insurances with providers. When is the last time anyone truly chose their health insurance provider? Has it ever led any non millionaire to be able to choose any doctor they want. This is spin coming from an industry fighting for its survival.\nSo instead of recognizing the spin for what it is, some Democrats look at some polls and see that change is not going to come without a fight, and they give up fearing such change would be too disruptive. \nNo significant change will ever come without being disruptive. Change comes if people are ready to accept that there will be losers and they are going to be vocal. That is what politics is about. Refusing disruption is to insure a republican win in November in whatever form it will take, including a weak democratic administration.",

Remember that Kennedy did not run on the civil rights legislation that LBJ passed, that Roosevelt was running during an epic depression, that Obama ran on national unification after another depression, while wisely refusing to quantify anything.  If you are really terrified of Trump, as you should be, then WarSands is not your pick in the primary.",

Her husband does work for the Warren campaign -- a clear compromise to Michelle's impartiality.  The column's claim that Warren is a \"unity\" candidate is simply not true -- whether among Democrats or the American electorate in general.  Warren's Medicare - for - All is highly divisive.  Because Warren recognizes the divisiveness of her medicare plan, she has back off from pushing it on the campaign trail.  Except for Sanders, Warren stands with the other leading contenders for \"weak\" support, not the strong support claimed by Michelle. Warren's candidacy -- contrary to the article's claim -- would exacerbate factionalism.  Some of Warren's statements and implications put off many of us who might otherwise support her.  Implying that those who do not agree with her are afraid and lacking in imagination is one example.  Finally, Michelle leaves out one huge element -- winning back those voters who twice voted Obama, then voted Trump.  They number six million.  Clearly there are other candidates who can appeal to these voters far, far better than Warren -- Buttigieg and Klobuchar to name two.",

Even if other polls lead to Warren, clearly the first set of polls suggest that Biden voters are open to Sanders.  Collectively therefore we can conclude that given that Biden is the most conservative of the major candidates and Sanders is clearly the least conservative (notwithstanding Sanders hope for conserving the ecological system), Sanders is a unity candidate.  Therefore, the preposition \"the\" in the original article is misplaced.\n\nSecond, the article says nothing about Republican or Independent voters and whether Warren as opposed to Sanders can win these over.  What about those who tend not to vote and how Sanders might win them over through his populist appeal?  Thus, the word \"unity\" by restricting itself to the Democratic Party is missing the larger and most important context for \"unity of voters.\"\n\nThird, to the extent this article is widely cited and read it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The more one says that Warren is \"the\" unity candidate, the more it is so.  Therefore, one wonders what the difference is between \"opinion\" and \"advocacy\" in a newspaper column.  Perhaps we need a new section of the paper called \"advocacy.\"",

Afterwards, Hillary sent Bernie a very warm thank-you note for his efforts. This anti-Bernie theory just won't die, and I'm tired of arguing about it.\n\n2. As a human being, I don't see how you can be very objective regarding the Democratic race if your husband works in one of the campaigns. It's just human nature to want your spouse to succeed.\n\n3. Ugly and sad, but I doubt that a woman can win either. And I say this as a Hillary voter. Most Americans, consciously or unconsciously, see men as leaders and women as \"helpmeets,\" as the Bible refers to married women. St. Paul taught that women should be silent in church. These ancient myths and divine instructions still have a hold on many minds, and other factors are involved, too, for example, just plain old male chauvinism and caveman attitudes.",

No one is perfect, but the mistakes she's continued to make since that time continue to demonstrate her demoralizing tendency to make unforced errors. After delaying her plan for health care insurance, she trucks out a version of Medicare for All that's similar to the one Sanders proposed except that it lacks his honesty about its costs. Then she claimed that she's never found anyone who likes their employer-based insurance. Seriously? Obviously she hasn't bothered to look. Meanwhile, her demand that 150 million Americans give up their employer-based health insurance before seeing its replacement  is political suicide. She could have adopted a public option with the promise to make it so appealing that private insurance would have to improve markedly or wither away, but instead she wants to destroy employer-based health care insurance before its replacement has demonstrated its viability. This and other missteps have made me wary rather than enthusiastic about Warren.  She's starting to look as politically tone deaf as Hillary. It'll take a better candidate to beat Trump.",

There were these very strong under currents at play back then in this Vietnam / post Civil Rights era. And 1972 was the year when the Deep South did turn red. This was a much bigger trend than just McGovern and people who keep bringing that up are drawing the wrong lessons.\n\nEW peculiar politics (\u201cprogressive capitalist\u201d, populist and technocrat rolled into one) may be a fit for today\u2019s changing politics. Fast increasing inequalities, middle class financial stress, hunger for right o left populism, drop of support for traditional free trade and internationalist engagement. It may be that EW is the right candidate now.\n\nIs she the best choice out there? I don\u2019t know. But she is my personal choice and her intellect, stamina, seriousness, moral compass and working class roots will make her a great president.",

In her hard won success and life-long fight for others, we see our best selves. And now, not a news cycle goes by where it isn't explained to us that we once again need to step aside and put our trust in a more moderate, male candidate who is better equipped to beat trump, not because they are the better candidate, but because somehow Warren is \"unelectable\".

You might argue that Warren is more unifying than Sanders, but that is not the same as saying she is a \"unity candidate.\" Far from it.

The Democratic Party thinking in the last election was that Hillary Clinton's email scandal was much to do about nothing, it certainly would not alienate any Democratic voters and not hurt her in attracting moderate Republicans with Trump as the candidate.  That was absolutely dead wrong.\n\nElizabeth Warren's baggage is that she lived an entire ascendant career as an educator promoting her Native American heritage.  At the University of Pennsylvania, she was listed as a Native American professor and touted as being only one of eight minority faculty to receive an award for outstanding performance.  At Harvard, she went right along with the college calling her the first female law professor of color.  And then we find out that her Native American heritage is so imperceptibly miniscule that she refused to reveal the results of her DNA testing.  Worse though is that the Cherokee Nation severely rebuked her and stated she was not one of theirs.  And prior to this outing of her faking her minority status, she did absolutely nothing as a legislator to help the Native Americans.\n\nElizabeth Warren is brilliant, well spoken and she has some good ideas.  But she has far heavier baggage than Hillary Clinton ever did.  Her misrepresentation of her race for most of her life will absolutely ensure she is never elected President of the United States.",

But she shows no signs of understanding how the finances of the federal gov works. She is persistently answering the question, \"How would you pay for it?\" by proposing new taxes that would bring in the cost of the program. This is kitchen table economics.\n\nThe idea that the federal gov has to pay for things, good & bad, with taxes or borrowing is just plain wrong.\n\nThe gov doesn't need your money. It can (thru the FED) create as much as it needs out of thin air. Just think about where money you pay your taxes with came from in the first place. Unless you have a printing press in your basement, it originally came from the federal gov.\n\nOf course, creating money has consequences, but that is entirely a different question. If the program greatly facilitates production, that will hold down prices. If we need to increase taxes at all, it may well be far less than $X.\n\nI don't know if Bernie understands this, but it seems he is perfectly willing to propose programs without worrying about taxes. In addition, he has advisors (e,g, Stephanie Kelton) who do understand how the federal gov works. I don't see any such advising Warren.\n\nA reader from Boston called max neatly summed it up: \"So many of our economic issues could be solved if people understood that the US cannot run out of money, and how hard it is to cause hyperinflation from gov spending alone.\"",

Moreover, Amy has a great sense of humor and would easily out-debate Trump - if that really matters - and could truly unite the anti-Trump/GOP majority counting the days to the next Election Day. \n\nI know - Amy is definitely not a loud, shiny object which explains her weak polling. Well, failing the POTUS nomination, she'd make a priceless VP addition to any ticket.",

Up until now Warren has stated that what was said in that private meeting was...private between the two of them.  Now, three weeks prior to the Iowa Caucuses, and while she is drowning in the polls, she contradicts that privacy and states that Sanders said a woman can not win the Presidency?\n\nAs Sanders said, how could he believe this, or say that after Hillary Clinton, arguably an incredibly unpopular candidate, beat Trump in the popular vote by almost 3 million votes in 2016.\n\nTrump has alienated everyone except his basest base.  Of course a female Democratic candidate can beat Trump in 2020.  I fear Warren is becoming desperate, and Goldberg adds salt to this.  This is very sad.",

Goldberg does this several times throughout her essay, blindly accepting and re-stating the Warren campaign spin on events.  I would be happy with either Warren or Sanders as the nominee, but I am deeply disappointed tonight with the Warren campaign, and even more deeply disappointed with the candidate, herself. What they are doing is clearly a coordinated effort to bring down a candidate who is (thus far) running an ethical campaign. I'm also disappointed with Goldberg for blindly accepting the Warren campaign's narrative. This is unlike her and does indeed show that on this topic, she does not see clearly.

How about federalizing Medicai that would achieve universal care and implementing Medicare for All on it and the existing Medicare program?

The claim that Sanders told Warren that \"a woman can't win\"  can only come from Warren, since there were only two in the room.  Sanders said he absolutely did not say that, and I believe him.  He has pointed out what we all remember clearly:  He wanted Warren to run in 2016 and only entered the race because she didn't run.   The second accusation, that the Sanders campaign was instructed to say that Warren only appealed to the elite,  was antithetical to the strict rules that the Sanders campaign had instituted.   Warren used this smear in a fundraising piece.   \n\nWarren was never a \"unity\" candidate, and certainly won't be considered one after these attacks on Sanders.  \n\nI am not a Sanders volunteer and I am not bound by Sander's rules to avoid criticizing the candidates, so I am going to say that I don't think Warren is a reliable  progressive.   She has a hard-right, Reaganomics history.   Even after she finally became a Democrat at age 46, she wrote that we don't \"need\" \"European-model\", \"quasi socialist\" safety nets.  A few months ago, she said that she didn't support publicly owned utilities.  She's signaled that she will adhere to the bi-partisan, hawkish foreign policy consensus.  She's backed away form a commitment to single-payer health.   \n\nNo, there is no easy way out, there is no \"unity\" candidate.  Hopefully, the progressive will win.",

As far as Social Security and Medicare being \"white programs\", it's my understanding that those who earn an income, regardless of race or ethnic group, have those items deducted  before they ever see a paycheck.  In reality, this is the government giving back to the wage earner what was rightfully theirs to start with.  This is a far cry from from a government hand-out for doing nothing.  Additionally, how does excluding refugees and immigrants amount to being an implied racist?  These programs are for citizens.

Yes, Trump is horrible on any number of fronts and issues, including Obamacare, foodstamps and non-white immigration, but his farm subsidies are not racially constructed but a policy offset in response to imposed sanctions that impact farmers in existential ways. Democrats would be pound foolish to adopt this rhetorical pablum. Comparing percentage of black farm ownership in Mississippi and then jumping to reduced share of black subsidy percentage seems blatantly distorted when crop size s the determinant, not racial profiles. Of course, smaller farmers might need additional protections as a result of greater operational vulnerability. Splicing one subject into the other is concocted analytics. Without much better outreach and advocacy of family farmers, white and black both, democrats will get caught up again in senseless anti-farmer talking points and come up a bushel short at the polls. Not again! Wake up and support farmers unambiguously including the strong merits of subsidies when market is distorted from sanction tinkering! American farmers work their tails off and are foundational to this country and world!",

They pay no fuel taxes, they are exempt from most OSHA regulations.  They are also the biggest employer of undocumented immigrants in rural areas.

Instead, like his \"big beautiful wall\", it was paid out by re-directing funds through real or imagined presidential authority.\n\nWe should be suspicious of any group in our society where debate and careful dialog cannot reach. Colleges, with their sky high tuition rates, represent another group all but beyond ordinary debate. They are doing a good thing, educating the next generation, so we just have to pay up? And pay up again in terms of crippling a rising generation with debts? I doubt it. No one has come forward with a good explanation of why college should cost three to six times what it did a generation ago, even when the figures are adjusted for inflation.\n\nIf Trump could pay off every group that supports him with federal dollars, your tax dollars, he could stay in office for life.

What was the criteria for payment?\n\nMy own research suggests payment went to the largest producers by volume, and then by acreage, in two rounds of payments. Both of these are reasonable criteria. They would however also both favor the largest farmers, most of whom are probably white. \n\nBoth the author and the editorial board need to go back, examine the data, and re-do this essay. If similarly situated black farmers got passed over (same volume, same acreage, same crops) then prove it. If the method of calculation is different from prior payments to alleviate losses from a trade dispute, then show that too. \n\nBut don\u2019t just drop naked assertions and call yourself finished.

They have to play this game because there aren't enough rich people to get them elected. But Democrats play the same game. Here in Seattle, the heavily left-leaning city council continually blames Amazon and landlords for societal problems that directly or indirectly affect us all, and in many cases aren't even caused by Amazon or landlords. The solutions proposed are also completely unmoored from practical reality. Why is this the case? Because they operate from the same playbook as Republicans: political expediency. It's a lot easier to get elected asking Amazon and landlords to cover all the costs than it is asking the public at large to pay the costs.

Farmers are very sophisticated, they got that way because of ethanol and FUEL ethanol that could and can be made cheaper than some federal and state payoffs when blended with filthy gasolines and oils of many kinds. I would not be shocked to learn the Trump organization owns farms that got and may yet get more of the bulk of cash aid from the Federal government - or some hidden ownerships that no one could ever find. This would not be illegal in that he does not own or control such interests. Ask any smart politician - most know how to gain by tacking their own personal 'interests' into the mix. It is the American way - I call it Domestic Financial Nepotism (DFN). It functions much like American Imperialism (AI?)  Americans were never stupid enough to take over nations by colonizing and/or enslaving their populations. Americans simply planted their corporations in the most lucrative areas of the world and took the lion's share of the profits and split them with policymakers and other more localized political interests who toed the line. Far less cruel than the British, French and Spanish colonists of earlier times who now follow the American way - at least for the moment.",

Now you have to have a household of at least four people to get into the territory where you can even get that amount maximum per month, let alone what people actually get based on income etc., and the people affected by the change are by definition without dependents. Looking at the NPR article linked though, the $5 billion estimate is over FIVE YEARS. So they are projected to save in five years about one quarter of the cost of the farm subsidies that have been going less than one year, just to put that all in perspective.\n\nDon't forget, adding new requirements and restrictions on government benefits only saves money if those requirements are enforced, and of course it costs money to enforce those requirements. So I'd say that $5 billion over five years is still probably an overestimate of the net savings.

Democrats in the United States used to be willing to admit that. Trump was elected in part on a pledge to combat that. His main weapon is trade tariffs. It is a powerful weapon, since the Chinese economy is strongly dependent on the ability to sell goods to the United States. And China's ability to strike back is limited, because the U.S. is nowhere near as dependent on selling goods to China as China is in selling goods to the U.S. But farming--and the production of soybeans--is one area where the U.S. does sell significant goods to China. So farmers are collateral damage this conflict between the United States and China. Under those circumstances, it seems totally appropriate for the U.S. to make payments to farmers, so they don't have to bear the brunt of the cost of a trade policy that is being pursued for the ultimate benefit of the country as a whole.\n\nAs to Bouie's broader argument that Trump is rewarding his constituents by pursuing policies that benefit them--how are the Democrats any different? Democrats support \"reparations\" for slavery. They support \"affirmative action\" programs that privilege non-whites (including recent immigrants) over whites. If they pursue policies that benefit their constituents and disadvantage others, one shouldn't be surprised when Republicans do the same.",

He would repeat for me what people were saying around us, word for word, swear words and everything. Most people filter or summarize things for deaf people, out of modesty and brevity, but for a kid like me, this person opened a world for me when I was young.

She is in a home where kind loving people care for her and five other young adults. She goes to a day program during the week. Thank goodness such resources are available to her and our family. \n\nWe have had a few (very few) people who did not understand her behavior and treated her poorly.  Our daughter was in a home for about 8 months that was a start up. We visited often and checked up on her health and general level of care. We became concerned about a diaper rash. After our emergency trip to the hospital, the regional staff jumped in with a surprise-visit to the home to discover find more evidence of neglect. The house closed immediately. She has since been placed in a loving caring group home. In her 25 years of care with others, only 8 months has been unacceptable. The rest of it has been extraordinarily loving. When all is working well, good government programs have advocates and systems in place to protect our most vulnerable.

If they had backdoors, surely the crafty U.S. government would use them right now to access these phones.

Simply put, encryption as a concept does not work the way a lock on a house does.\n\nI can pick the lock on your house (subtle approach), I can bash it open (brute force approach), or I can go in through the backdoor.\n\nIf I want to get at encrypted data, I can try to finagle access to the encryption key through social engineering or possibly find a mistake in the way the encryption algorithm was implemented that lets me figure out what the key should be. This would be analogous to picking the lock. Well, the guy who knew the key is dead so no social engineering option, and if Apple did a good job, there are no implementation failures to exploit. It was this approach that allowed the FBI to get access to the phone in the previous incident; the Israeli company knew of a mistake that had not been fixed yet. Apple has since patched that bug. The issue is that if any phone can be \"picked,\" they all can.\n\nThe second option is brute force.  Unless you have a quantum computer, this is not an option.\n\nThird option is a backdoor. Well, the phone already exists and presumably Apple didn't put a backdoor in when it was first made; adding one after the fact is going to require you to solve one of the first two options. This is the long term solution that security services want, but adding a backdoor is just creating a vulnerability for bad actors to exploit.",

You can brute force the user key since now you're not restricted to 10 attempts before the phone wipes, and I'm sure the government has enough computing resources to brute force a 6 digit pin.\n\nThis is all theoretical though - I'm not aware of anyone that has successfully attempted something like I described and there is a good chance that trying it will completely destroy the data.
