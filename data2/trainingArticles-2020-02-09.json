            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Question All Democrats Need to Ask Themselves If \nyour preferred candidate doesn\u2019t win the nomination, will you still do \neverything you can to deny Trump a second term? By David Leonhardt Opinion \nColumnist It\u2019s been a rough week for Democrats. President Trump is preening over\n his acquittal, his poll numbers and the economy, while the Democratic \nnomination race looks like a divided mess. Many Democratic voters are anxious \nthat they have no great candidates, only those guaranteed to alienate one half \nof the party or the other. Moderates worry that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth \nWarren aren\u2019t just wrong on big issues, but too left wing to get elected. \nProgressives worry that Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Michael \nBloomberg are uninspiring centrists who resemble recent presidential losers and \nwouldn\u2019t solve America\u2019s problems even if they won. My message to panicking \nDemocrats is: Take a deep breath, and don\u2019t make your job harder. Neither side \nof the party can ensure that its preferred candidate will win the nomination. \nBut both can help avoid the outcome they fear most \u2014 Trump\u2019s re-election. The \ncurrent moment, when everybody is wearing a veil of ignorance about the \nnomination, is a good time for Democrats to ask themselves a question: If the \nprimaries don\u2019t turn out as you hope, will you still do everything in your power\n to deny Trump a second term? Or will you instead exaggerate your differences \nwith the nominee \u2014 say, complain about Sanders or Warren as a Trump-style \nradical; or buy into the caricature of Buttigieg as a corporate tool; or \nretweet, with outrage added, the least enlightened things Biden or Bloomberg has\n ever said? Yes, the candidates have their differences. But they have much \nbigger similarities. If elected, every single Democratic presidential candidate \nwould act to slow climate change, raise taxes on the rich, reduce gun deaths, \nexpand voting rights, lower health care and education costs, protect abortion \naccess, enforce civil-rights laws, appoint progressive judges, rebuild overseas \nalliances and stop treating the Justice Department as a personal enforcer. The \nmoderates are running to the left of Barack Obama, and the progressives would be\n constrained by Congress. The alternative, of course, is truly radical. Many \nDemocrats know all this, yet they still get so caught up in the passions of the \nprimary campaign that they risk helping Trump. Whether progressives and \nmoderates can find common ground is likely to be a defining political question \nnot just of 2020 but of this decade. As E.J. Dionne asks in the first sentence \nof \u201cCode Red,\u201d his new book, \u201cWill progressives and moderates feud while America\n burns?\u201d Dionne, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and Washington Post \ncolumnist, tells a story about American politics that I find clarifying. In the \npast, thorny policy debates typically took place between the two parties. \nExamples include the best way to expand health insurance (through the private \nsector or government), control pollution (through taxes or regulations) and \nreduce the deficit (through spending cuts or tax increases). Today the \nRepublican Party has become so radicalized that it opposes almost any government\n action to solve problems. Its domestic agenda consists largely of cutting taxes\n for the rich and freeing companies from oversight. The substantive part of many\n policy debates now happens within the Democratic Party \u2014 which means that \ntensions are only natural. And yet progressives and moderate Democrats still \nagree on far more than they disagree. Each side would be more effective if it \nwere open to learning from the other, Dionne writes, rather than lapsing into \n\u201can unseemly moralism that feeds political superiority complexes.\u201d Progressives \nare right that over the past half century Democratic moderates have often \nallowed conservatives to dictate the terms of political conversation, on \neconomic growth, criminal justice, family values and more. I\u2019d add that \nmoderates have also spent too much time designing technocratically elegant \npolicies (like tax credits) rather than creating easily understandable, popular \nprograms. Moderates, for their part, are right that every great progressive \nvictory in American history \u2014 abolition, women\u2019s suffrage, the income tax, labor\n rights, Social Security, civil rights, Medicare, marriage equality and more \u2014 \nhas required compromise in the service of persuading allies who disagree with \nprogressives on other issues. It\u2019s not enough to state your case purely and wait\n for a silent progressive majority to emerge as never before. In the long run, \neach side is likely to accomplish much more if it can recognize that the other \nisn\u2019t the enemy. In the short run, obviously, there is an inescapable dilemma: \nThe party can nominate only one person. Before that choice is made \u2014 while both \nsides are fighting hard for their preferred nominees, as they should \u2014 they \nshould pause to reflect on the strengths of the other side. For progressives, \nthat means recognizing that moderate congressional candidates really did fare \nbetter in swing districts in 2018. It also means celebrating (quietly, for now, \nI realize) the progressivism of, say, Buttigieg\u2019s agenda. For moderates, it \nmeans acknowledging that Sanders\u2019 pugnacious authenticity appeals to some swing \nvoters more than wonkish centrism does. And it means pushing back against the \nfalse notion that Sanders and Warren are somehow un-American. A Sanders or \nWarren presidency would have more in common with Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s presidency \nthan a second Trump term would have with either of them. The 2020 campaign still\n has a long way to go. Democrats should remember which parts of it they can\u2019t \ncontrol and which they can.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Who\u2019s Really Shredding Standards on Capitol Hill? \nNaming the alleged whistle-blower is much worse than tearing up a speech. By \nJoanne Freeman Dr. Freeman is a historian at Yale. Last week, the House speaker,\n Nancy Pelosi, said a lot without speaking a word. At the close of President \nTrump\u2019s State of the Union address, she calmly, deliberately and now famously \ntore her copy in two and tossed it down with a shrug, declaring her disdain for \nits contents with aplomb. This simple gesture sent a strong message. Most \nspeakers are expressionless during State of the Union addresses or they come \nclose; Speaker John Boehner couldn\u2019t quite mask his \u201cmicro-expressions\u201d of \nfrustration during President Barack Obama\u2019s address in 2015. Speaker Pelosi \noffered a cri de coeur in comparison, as she intended. The speech was \u201ca \nmanifesto of mistruths,\u201d she said during a news conference two days later. \u201cIt \nwas necessary to get the attention of the American people to say, \u2018This is not \ntrue.\u2019\u201d And she succeeded, perhaps beyond her expectations. Violating \ncongressional traditions to make a point is itself a longstanding tradition for \ngood reason. Republicans heard that message loud and clear, denouncing her \nincivility, accusing her of shredding \u201cdecades of tradition\u201d and demanding her \nresignation. It was the \u201cmost classless act ever conducted in Congress,\u201d Ian \nMiles Cheong, the managing editor of the conservative website Human Events, \ncharged. But was it? Not by a long shot; when it comes to misconduct, Congress \nhas a long history. Congressmen have pulled guns on each other. They\u2019ve shoved \nand punched each other, and smacked at foes with fireplace tongs. They\u2019ve \nengaged in mass brawls, toppling desks, tossing spittoons and, in one case, \nyanking off a toupee. The most famous violence in congressional history is the \ncaning of the abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts by \nRepresentative Preston Brooks of South Carolina on the Senate floor in 1856, but\n it was not an anomaly. Nor is Ms. Pelosi alone in violating traditions for all \nto see; it was far from the first time that members of Congress met alleged lies\n with bold displays of open contempt. In 1790, Representative Aedanus Burke of \nSouth Carolina showed his feelings with a flourish after Alexander Hamilton, the\n Treasury secretary, slurred the Southern militia during an Independence Day \nspeech. Hamilton had said that Southern troops were dispirited and in disarray \nbefore the arrival of Gen. Nathanael Greene. Burke \u2014 outraged and hoping to \nimpress folks back home \u2014 used the theater of Congress to have his say. Turning \ntoward the visitor gallery, he declared, \u201cIn the face of this assembly and in \nthe presence of this gallery \u2026 I give the lie to Colonel Hamilton.\u201d Onlookers \nwere stunned. Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas did much the same when \nPresident Obama discussed his health care plan before the House in 2009, waving \na handwritten sign that read, \u201cWhat Plan?\u201d \u201cThe things he was saying were \ncertainly not true of the only bill we had at the time,\u201d Mr. Gohmert later said.\n On that same night, Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina shouted \u201cYou \nlie!\u201d at the president for a similar reason. By far, the most skilled \npractitioners of this showy statecraft were Southern slaveholders in the decades\n leading up to the Civil War. Threatened by even the hint of opposition to \nslavery, they used bold public threats during debate to frighten their foes into\n compliance or silence, tossing off insults or dangling duel challenges to set \nan example. Faced with the choice of a fistfight or a duel \u2014 or the humiliation \nof avoiding one \u2014 most men backed down or held back. For Southerners, \ntransgressing rules was part of the point; it was a show of power. Senator Rand \nPaul of Kentucky used the same form of showmanship when he exposed the alleged \nwhistle-blower\u2019s name during impeachment proceedings last Tuesday. Days after \nChief Justice John Roberts refused to read a question from Mr. Paul that \nrevealed the name, Mr. Paul did the deed himself. During a period reserved for \nimpeachment speeches, he read his question aloud while standing next to a large \nblue poster with the name in bold yellow, endangering the whistle-blower and \nviolating the spirit of whistle-blower protection laws in the process; although \nthose laws are meant to protect informants from retaliation, they don\u2019t \nexplicitly stop members of Congress or the president from revealing names. \nTradition and ethics alone keep them silent. Although not strictly speaking \nillegal, Mr. Paul\u2019s actions were wrong, and some Republican colleagues said as \nmuch, privately admitting that they \u201cprobably\u201d wouldn\u2019t have done it. But for \nMr. Paul, violating norms was the point. By exposing the name \u2014 and getting away\n with it \u2014 he was warning off potential whistle-blowers-to-be. Did he succeed? \nWe don\u2019t yet know, though the bar of success is low; prevent one potential \ninformant from stepping forward, or even give one pause, and Mr. Paul has scored\n a victory. President Trump\u2019s public name-calling and bullying have done much \nthe same, frightening people into compliance for fear of vengeance in Washington\n or back home. Mr. Paul\u2019s stunt shows us the real power of such transgressions. \nIncivility is one thing; bullying people into silence is quite another. The \nformer scores points. The latter potentially warps the balance of power between \nCongress and the executive branch, and smothers the protections that make \ngovernment go. These are the sins that should merit our outrage, get us out \ncampaigning and march us to polling places. The defense of our system of \ngovernment demands no less. Joanne B.
