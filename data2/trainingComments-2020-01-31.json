            "comment_body": "The American prison system, in practice, serves two purposes.  The more defensible of the two focuses on the protection of the population from individuals whose behavior marks them as a threat to public safety.  But American ideals temper this legitimate fear with the belief that the vast majority of inmates are redeemable, and therefore the system of punishment should be designed to prepare them for reentry into society.\n\nThe second purpose of incarceration, however, contradicts this goal.  We imprison people to punish them, to make them suffer for the fear and the harm they have inflicted on the rest of us.   In effect, we conceive of justice as a form of legalized revenge.  In our view, they have violated the rules that protect a society built on individual freedom, and therefore they deserve to be cast out of that society and into the outer darkness that constitutes our prison system.  We may not want them to suffer abuse, but we also don't want prisons  to resemble \"country clubs.\"\n\nThis idea of justice may satisfy our moral standards, but it does nothing to help inmates reenter society or to make our communities safer.  Until we change our attitude toward the people we lock up and drastically alter our approach to the purpose of their incarceration, no reforms will end the horrors associated with Parchman and other outposts of hell in America.  Inmates of prisons are not the only members of our society who need to adopt a more humane set of values.",

More often than not, the pain of personal disappointments arises from our moral shortcomings and this is no less true for a society plagued by the pain of social injustice.  But we are far too often satisfied by the bluntest of analgesics: a vengeful and public spectacle of justice - the execution of the vitality and pride of an entire class of young men -  that quiets our fears, if only for a moment.\n\nOn each face of the many-headed beast that is our American judicial system, we find these dualities represented with shameful imbalance - a monstrous hypocrisy to gaze upon. We try to turn away, to forget these things, but we see again and again the ugliness of our neglect pressed into the twisted, shattered faces of our American children - those black and brown lives we have likewise neglected.  If only, for once, our wounded pride could be suborned for a season, and with riotous courage, we could rise to be carried still further by those better angels of our being. Perhaps then the truths of justice can be found,  and with them, the balanced apportionment of all the blessings and responsibilities our America has to offer.\n\nVengeance, it seems to me, has no place in justice.",

In Jackson, the state capital, the public schools are almost entirely African-American while the elite private schools are almost entirely white.  Then there is the state\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid, leaving tens of thousands without adequate healthcare.  And finally, even with a large population of African-Americans in the state (over one third), the state\u2019s leadership remains largely white, male, straight, and Republican, and there is little interest among this group for any kind of educational, healthcare, and prison reform.  They retain power through through clever voter suppression methods, ensuring that a modern version of apartheid remains firmly in place, made complete by their refusal to change the state flag with its nod to the confederacy.  As long as the current brand of Republicans hold onto power in Mississippi, I don\u2019t see anything changing.

The vast majority of prisoners in this country are repeat offenders, if not career criminals. State prisoners have an average of six convictions, and 60% have been convicted of a serious violent crime. More than 30% of violent offenders had a gun, with half of those having fired it while committing the crime they're currently locked up for. Less than 1% and 4% of federal and state prisoners are there for drug possession, with virtually all of those pleaded down from trafficking\u2014the idea that people are routinely imprisoned for small amounts of marijuana is a complete fabrication. Prisoners, on the whole, are a dangerous group.  After release, almost half are rearrested in the first year, and 85% are eventually rearrested. The reduction of murder in NYC during the Stop-Question-Frisk policy saved more than 5,000 minority lives\u2014and even the plaintiffs who sued to stop SQF claimed only 5% of stops were unwarranted. No one likes prisons\u2014but as long as there is crime, we will need them.  Decarceration for its own sake will result in innocent deaths. The single best way to reduce the prison population is to reduce crime\u2014but  Bouie and others fail to offer provable policies that will do so.",

One solution would be to disallow the use of prisoners for labor at less than market rate for the work performed and require compliance with minimum wage, as well as eliminate prohibitions on licensing or hire in fields in which individuals have been trained in prison upon release. In addition, eliminating for-profit prisons would result in a reduction of incarceration.

By that I mean the violent overthrow of Reconstruction through organizations like the Ku Klux Klan and the re-enslavement of previously emanicpated slaves through a system of arresting people on spurious charges and \"renting\" the prisoners out to plantations and logging camps as cheap labor. Parchman was part of that scheme.\n\nTo natter on about personal responsibility is a shameful diversion. The real problem is the system. We live in an extremely violent system where people are treated like expendable objects and racism is the ideology that justifies that behavior. Objects, by contrast, specifically money, rank much higher than considerations related to the proper treatment of our fellow human beings.\n\nThe shocking death figures in Mississippi deserve condemnation not excuses.

This does 2 things for media outlets like the Times. \n\nFirst, it helps them shore up their own dedicated fringe subscribers. \n\nSecondly, though, it pushes the left ever farther away from the mainstream and from political success, which is right where the media, activist, and entertainment complex wants it. When the left is out of power, and mentally insecure, it drives even more of them into the arms of the bad-take-generators. \n\nThe same thing happens on the right.

Further, the vast majority of persons in jail (as opposed to prison) are supposed to be jailed short term because they have not been convicted of anything.  And finally, in theory, it is the courts that are supposed to determine sentencing, not the prisons or prison guards.  With these thoughts in mind here are a few questions: Given the high rate of recidivism, how many persons back in prison were innocent the first time around?  When did under-educated and under-paid prison/jail guards become the arbiters of life and death instead of the courts?  Given the abundance of proof regarding a racist and cruel prison/jail system, how many black and brown men have been murdered by the system since the beginning/end of, say, Jim Crow?

Hence, the recent efforts by extreme leftists to secure prosecutorial positions based on platforms expressly pledging not to enforce the law.

            "comment_body": "Prison, sentencing & bail reform will never happen because advocates are hypocritical. They don't want to deal with the consequences of their legislation. Bond reform is a great example. Bond is about returning defendants to court. Nobody does it at less cost to the state than professional bondsmen. A service to the defendants, the victims, & the court. The innocent exist in the system but the problem is not fixed by the elimination of bond. Chicago tried this. Carjackings (deemed merely 'property crimes) doubled the first year this was attempted. The next year, it doubled again. And the next year, it doubled again. Finally, local officials are starting to admit that cashless bail isn't a good idea. It's one thing to release people on cashless bail when their crime is poverty-related. Driving without insurance, floating checks, stealing diapers. Holding people in jail for not having money when they obviously don't have money is essentially inflicting punishment without a trial. But for all others...then cash-free bail is an idiotic idea. Judges have only two choices: keep a person in jail or release them. In most cases, it's a straightforward decision. But it's those cases in the middle that cause problems. Bail provides a third option. It's for some of those tough decisions when and why bail is appropriate because money or the fear of losing it - is a motivator. We will never have prison reform until the proponents care as much about the victims as they do the incarcerated.",

Americans like to imagine that totalitarian governments such as China, Saudi Arabia , North Korea and Egypt present a contrast to the 'freedom' of the US, but no nation anywhere at any time has imprisoned such a large portion of it's population. The system is as massive as it is savagely inhumane. As Mr. Bouie suggests, the system derives directly from slavery with its white slave patrols, state-sanctioned lynching and KKK-enforced Jim Crow, which is why the states that imprison the most people, a disproportionate number of them blacks and other people of color, the same states  that  impose the most horrible prison conditions, are those in the South. What is most criminal is that every stage of the enterprise has been fully integrated within a for-profit industry. Difficult as it may be for many in the US to accept, if the government stopped warehousing black men or fomenting war throughout the world, the US economy would take a nosedive.  The reason that people continually reinforce such unimaginable cruelty is because the US has been putting people in cages for centuries, which is surely why Mr. Bouie's editorial concludes so pessimistically. As long as the white establishment can get away with exercising its power to dehumanize others while turning a profit, it will.  A system of white supremacy resting on weapons, war and cages.",

There has never been a time in US history where the socioeconomic gap has been greater between the upper and lower income brackets, and it will continue to increase along with the prison population as long as monetary gain remains the primary factor for policy. This is essentially criminal behavior by those responsible for constructing this reality. Of course this would be impossible to prosecute in our justice system because it is also motivated and manipulated by money. Do we really think OJ Simpson would be walking around today if he did not have the money to spend on the high price lawyers he had monetary access to? Just as OJ had enough money to buy his justice, corporations have enough money to buy their just profits.

But very thoughtful commentators and researchers have begun to point out that, at last, many fewer people are being sent to prison for such things; that the long-term prison population is at this point composed more of people who have committed more serious crimes. The question then becomes -- what to do? Again, some commentators have advocated a \"forgiveness\" model -- much shorter terms, or no prison at all, even for violent crimes. (Presumably educational opportunities and rehab will be offered). Given the size of our prison population, the brutality, and the very long sentences we impose -- should we be looking toward the forgiveness model? I think that is what Jamelle Bouie is arguing for here. I'm not sure -- this would be hard for the US to do! --- but as a start I would lean toward shorter sentences.",

Because alcohol is so deeply ingrained in the social fiber of our nation, it is easy to overlook its profoundly negative impact on one's physical and mental health. You are lucky that you did not develop any alcohol related physical illness.\n\n Some people can drink socially without overdoing it, but many are unable to manage that feat because of their genetic endowment. For anyone who is unsure, the best policy is to completely abstain. Once you have gone too far, it's quite challenging to pull yourself back from the abyss.\n\nNo one needs alcohol. in fact, if alcohol were invented in 2020, the FDA would never approve it- it has a high potential for abuse & no accepted medical uses (well, IV alcohol can stop premature labor). But the alcohol lobby is powerful, so it's here to stay, like it or not.\n\n If a person simply must have some recreational substance, marijuana is far safer. Alcohol causes fights, rapes, car crashes, & a host of social problems. Marijuana doesn't. Our brains are wired to receive cannabis- our brains have cannabinoid receptors whose only function is to mediate the effects of cannabinoids, some of which occur naturally in everyone's brain. But our brains don't have alcohol receptors, and our livers can't metabolize alcohol until we induce the necessary enzymes by drinking alcohol.\n\n Cheers!",

Sure I was drinking \u201csafe\u201d amounts of alcohol, but for me at least, it had become too much. Unmanageable. Psychologically problematic. Not to mention it\u2019s very easy to imagine a future when the \u201csafe amounts\u201d will sound like doctored proscribed cigarette usage sounds to us know.\n\n Anyway, I think there a hell of a lot of folks in this country going through the same experience - sure it\u2019s not destroying your life, but it\u2019s certainly taking a toll. I got tired of paying that toll every morning. Also, for me it wasn\u2019t a switch to total abstinence, but simply changing my relationship to it. Not in the house, not alone, not as a reality buffer. Now I wake up bright eyed and rested. I smile in the AM - I hadn\u2019t done that for years. Like you, I feel proud and connected to my environment and neighbors. It\u2019s such a lovely change.\n\nAlso kudos for not needing AA. I think it has its place, but for the silent majority of folks like us, examples of a proportionate response to the problem is heart warming to hear. I\u2019m not spending the rest of my life self identifying as an alcoholic. I already left that behind.",

Perhaps that's something, Ms. Wartik, you can delve into further. \n\nOne small point. Being \"lonesome\" is not a condition requiring 'medication' and, I fear, the belief that it is leads to much pain. Being alone, and feeling lonesome are a part of the human condition.

For a nation with a diabetes and weight problem the notion that hundreds (or thousands)  of empty calories a day ( a single, average size margarita has 274 calories) is just fine is bad advice. \n\nAs you learned, listening to your gut can be a much better predictor of what is right and normal for you. I think many people have been lulled into a false sense of safety by looking at these charts. In a sad paradox, it encourages them to drink more, not drink less.\n\nI think those who are consulting charts, working the numbers, and checking this out obsessively would probably do well to cut back before the condition worsens.

I was truly surprised to find reasonably healthy people getting together to help other people get/stay healthy.          It not for everyone?? That is true but not for the reasons people state in the comments.  Many people just don\u2019t like feeling like maybe they didn\u2019t have all the answers after all.  Religious?? The step literally says \u201c...God of YOUR understanding.\u201d  I\u2019ve never heard that in religion.  I started out just believing the waves at the ocean were bigger than me,  Not one person in AA questioned that...people outside of AA did. Cult?? Ridiculous.  In reading the comments I hear over and over some of same characteristics that kept me believing my drinking was a not a problem...denial, selfishness, and arrogance.",

I felt crazy, moved from place to place, lied, cheated and manipulated anyone I could to get what I wanted. When I entered the hospital I was sure I was mentally ill, and that I needed serious psychiatric help. I will never forget what the psychiatrist told me after reading though my history. She looked up at me and said, \"You are an alcoholic and if you remove alcohol from your life, the rest of these problems will go away.\" That was 30 years ago-and she was right. I had been to AA twice before in my young life, but this time I truly felt my life was in danger. \nYou can say I \"grew up\" in AA-I was brainwashed, and my brain needed to be brainwashed because I was a sick person. \nAA is not the only game in town, but it the game I learned. \nAm I sober? Many people in AA would tell me no, because after 30 years of never using ANY drug I have found that cannabis is an extremely effective cure for the insomnia and mood swings of menopause. \"A drug is a drug is a drug\" is simply scientifically NOT true. I can smoke a bowl and not end up in another city (alcohol), in a stranger's bed (alcohol), regret what I said or did the night before (alcohol), have my stomach pumped...To thine own self be true!",

Most everyone CAN stop, but it will likely take much more effort and determination than expected, because of the addiction but also because of habit and social expectations. \n\nThe simple fact is if you use an addictive substance regularly for an extended period of time, your use will likely increase in amount and frequency and your body will become more or less strongly addicted to alcohol.  There's so much blame and denial, but this is a biological fact. \n\nI'm glad I don't ever have to drink alcohol - and ruin my sleep and make myself more or less sick the next day - ever again.",

I learned early in my recovery that \"it's not how much I drink or how often I drink but what happens to me what I drink.\" Almost anything is possible from uneventful to complete insanity. I frequently auditioned for DWI but was never picked. Anyway, as so many people before me one day I stood at a turning point and I was for that moment willing to take a path I had never tried. The obsession was lifted almost immediately for me and I was freed from the bondage of alcoholism. And now my life is about becoming free from the bondage of self. A much harder endeavor. I got sober in AA and I stay sober in AA. I love the program and my nut job friends. We laugh endlessly, we cry when necessary, and we encourage one another and call each other on our nonsense when appropriate. Some people do not need the support. I do. It's that simple.

But I also had a stroke, a year earlier that almost killed me. That St Pat's eve. I ate a bowl of chili with my beer. An hour later I got home and couldn't swallow. Only because I was aware of the seriousness of that symptom because of the previous stroke, did I think of getting down to the ER fast! All I can say is-- you don't know the extent of what you DON'T know about alcohol's effect on your own system sometimes until it's too late. Most of my life I was a 2 beer an evening drinker or 2 glasses of wine, not unlike the author. Since I quit drinking (I have a glass of wine once a month, but always drink a glass of water with it), my health has improved, I've had no more strokes, strangely my dentist who yearly had to fill cavities in my teeth, didn't have 1 cavity to fill in the last 3 years. Yes, it is a good thing not to dwell on the guilt ridden, self thrashing, woeful sinner approach that is attributed to AA whether deserved or not. But it is also not so good to over celebrate the benefits of alcohol for the lucky few who are impervious to its toxic effects. Most of us lie in between. Alcohol provides pleasure and seemingly magic to some situations in life, making us think that situation is better that the other 90% of life. It's not. And sometimes we receive a very rude awakening.",

Many problems I had over my adult years can be traced back to, \"I was drunk that night\" or not thinking clearly the next day.

I decided to stop drinking to lose weight. Too my surprise, I went into moderate alcohol withdrawals----moderately shakey and horrible anxiety. Many people don't realize they are addicted to alcohol and do not attribute their anxiety when they go without drinking, to alcohol withdrawal. I loved drinking, but I love not having to be dependent on a substance much more.  For me, AA offers support from a group of people who really understand what I went through.  Because alcohol is pushed as a fun drink so much in our society, what I hear at any meeting helps me to get the message that it is not fun for me anymore.  If you think you may have a problem with alcohol, try stopping and see what happens.

Good on you for fixing yourself.\n\nOne thing that has always amazed me is the intolerance some people have for all things alcohol- they automatically assume if you drink you have a problem. Not so, only some people have a problem- and when you see it you recognize how large that monkey on the back can be. This is where friends or AA can save a life. The dark side of booze is a nightmare for some.\n\nStory: knock on the door years ago and soon a not so soft sell by a JW was under way. I noted how the person's eyes fastened on a can of beer on my table and the look in their eyes could not have been more condemnatory.  When I heard a shift in tone about evil this and evil that. I stopped the spiel and I asked if they had ever heard of \"Judge not lest ye be judged\". The bulb did not go off, I shut the door, took a pull on my beer and thought \"I don't know about all that god stuff but I do know this: Molson sure makes a nice bevie and I think I will have another.\"",

Diagnostic tools are fine, what resonates is we all need to find our limits BEFORE we go over into full addictive habits that cross lines. No tool, survey, or justification can do that. \n\nLook around and ask questions to those who know you to find limits. You will be very surprised what some will say. \n\nSome years no alcohol, some with social alcohol, but others with everyday alcohol. All while being an upstanding professional, father, husband. No crime, behavior, symptoms. No one said anything- until I asked. \n\nWhat they said surprised me. So much that I stopped instantly. Withdrawals, outpatient treatment, and liver damage were the result of something that I never thought about previously. \n\nIf you are reading the article, ask yourself why?  Go sit in a group setting for a few weeks and see how bad it can get, because it will inevitably.  That might be all you need at the precipice. \n\nNo amount is safe, apologies social drinkers. There is a root cause you need to find and associate, as in the author, often masked in our own perceptions. Mine was a numbing habit superficially, altered brain chemistry clinically, abuse and trauma emotionally. \n\nOdd thing about the entirety of the past six months- never once craved a drink to cope.

I watched others drink and loose control, become boisterous, aggressive, stupid. I woke up early on weekends to go jogging watching others come from their party nights with green skin and sunken eyes, and rejoiced in my chosen wellbeing. Further, I even enjoyed my socializing better as I realized I could engage and have meaningful and fun conversations just the same -it only took a little longer to do so, as if all alcohol did was to speed up my un inhibiting. \n\nAlas, I slowly started drinking again years later and today I struggle with a moderate drinking problem of a different order: I like my glass of wine at dinner that often turns into two or three. I often think of going back to sober. I know I can do it but I don\u2019t. Why? For me, knowing I can do something is worse than not knowing it, because I don\u2019t have the need to prove myself.

And, that perhaps some readers will look at their own situation and decide that it's time to just stop, period.\n\nTo my mind, alcohol is given way too much credit for its supposedly important accompaniment to so much we do: most social situations (I became an adult during the time of the ubiquitous \"cocktail party,\" during the 1960s--I didn't know a single person who wasn't drinking in those days--some who shouldn't have been), weddings, wakes & funerals, going out on a date, meeting with friends after work, sports events, lunches and dinners, and on and on.\nAlcohol is found just about everywhere in our daily lives!\n\n It's so heartening to learn of Ms. Wartik's ability to change her life in such an incredibly meaningful way. With stopping drinking she's made something important out of her life that will spread in a good way to her own self-respect--perhaps helping with her depressed feelings,--to her family, and to those who care about her.

The \u201cdrink\u201d is an excuse for the ritual.  Similarly, when we \u201chave a drink with a friend\" we are seeking emotional connection.  When we toast t a wedding we seek a feeling of \u201ccelebration.\u201d  In every case, putting ethanol in the blood stream only blunts these emotional pleasures.  Add to that the eroded sleep of a brain metabolising alcohol, and the nervous anxiety of low self-esteem that often goes with drinking, and you see that drinking actually destroys relaxation and every other pleasure it claims to provide. \nBWF in Santa Monica",

It was my first time back in my hometown in 48 years. The social math of the occasion was painful. 20 to 30 dead.  Their deaths mostly associated with alcohol abuse.  Another 20 to 30 couldn't attend. Why? Life style issues associated with alcohol abuse. It, alcohol abuse, was the elephant in the room.  In my youth I was a heavy drinker but family and professional obligations pretty much eliminated the drink from my life. Except for my wine phase that kicked in for a few years in my late 50's. Now the aging process and struggling to maintain good health placed booze out of my life style.  So many people, good people, lives altered, wasted, or gone, because of alcohol. Sad. Not the happy ending I was searching for.",

Transferring addictions.  Unrealistic expectations. Denial. Failure to account for the damage done to oneself and others.\n\nI am not judging. I always see myself when I see these behaviors in the newly sober. Maybe you're one of the few who can and should move cleanly into the future. I've met about five people out of five hundred who actually deserve to do that. I'm not a fan of AA, but they're right about more stuff than they're wrong. To put a finer point my belief -- AA is full of many unreported predators who are waiting for weak victims to exploit, especially women (I expect tons of hate from AA loyalists because of this belief).\n\nI wish you luck.

One note, while I do appreciate all the statistics and definitions and scientific explanations, for me it has always been this simple:  my personality changes dramatically when under the influence of alcohol, in exactly the same way as yours does.  Quantity is irrelevant.  Normal drinkers do not obsess about their consumption in the way that I did, nor make bargains with themselves that they'll only drink every other day, or only on weekdays, etc.  I do hope that your own resolve will see you through, but I heartily endorse AA.  In the beginning I went to meetings so that I would have the support to not drink, at some point I was getting so much out of the  meetings emotionally and spiritually that they became a cherished part of my week.

Let that sink in. People who don't have a problem quitting alcohol, never take those tests. Once you took your first one - even though you \"passed\" - it was simply a matter of time before you came to understand your addiction. And there it is, the \"A-word\" - alcoholic, addict - they're one and the same. And the sooner you accept this, the sooner you'll be on a solid path to recovery.\n\nBut many like yourself fear accepting their condition, and fear seeking the help that's available. You said:\n\n\"I didn\u2019t join A.A., though I don\u2019t rule it out. I sought support from my husband, daughter and friends...I devoured others\u2019 stories, watching movies about alcoholics, reading memoirs, lurking in sub-Reddits for people struggling to quit.\"\n\nThe support you sought and still seek is available to you. While AA is the most widely known, there are other groups. I myself just celebrated 28 years sober and still go to meetings because I get support that I get nowhere else, and the key is I get it without judgement. Also, get the book Alcoholics Anonymous even if you decide the meetings aren't for you. In there you'll find things like: We are like men who have lost their legs, we never grow new ones\".

Shame on her for the reckless clickbait. \n\nShe also undercuts the medical advancements of legitimizing the disease of addiction and removing the stigma by suggesting that a moderate drinker who sometimes says clumsy things while drinking, needs to get sober. If anyone who ever said something embarrassing or foolish while having a drink thought they should get sober, there\u2019d be no alcohol in the world. \n\nMaybe the author did need to get sober to relieve her shame and empower her path of self righteousness (which she acknowledged was a delightful side effect of abstinence), but sobriety is a necessary and lifesaving solution for people with life-threatening addictions, not successful professionals who have two drinks a day and say dumb things every once in awhile. People with loose lips betray trust with or without alcohol. \n\nWe need to stop making sobriety so casual and respect that it is a lifelong battle that many people with real addictions\u2014not a glass of wine while cooking dinner\u2014would give their right eye to achieve.",

I very much appreciate your willingness to cure yourself and save your relationships. But the old saying that you can only save yourself when you've hit bottom is fine if you still have enough left to bounce back. Many many people, I suspect, hit bottom and die. Literally. I divorced my spouse of 23 years because I was tired of the verbal abuse ( the most egregious - to me - the accusation that the drinking was the result of my stupidity).  My ex died, a few years later, because one of the many falls was fatal.  My children were deprived of a parent, I of a spouse, and of course there was no question of child support because guess who was drinking it?  It was long enough ago for me to forgive and even to remember some of the good times we had early on.  I also still blame myself (partially) for whatever it was that happened. I believe that that is a syndrome, too, not enjoyed but common to people who have been chronically abused.  I have not joined the temperance gang; I enjoy a glass of wine or a drink but I don't need it. I recognize that there are people who do. But please please remember the families and the children;  and how much better it can be if you accept help early-on.",

(Is that a uniquely American thing?) \n\nPeople waste an incredible amount of time trying to figure out whether or not they are this thing called an \u201calcoholic.\u201d I was highly adept at gaming all of those tests the author mentions. (Q: Do you ever drink alone. A: Well, I\u2019m sitting on a stool getting hammered in the Beacon Hill Pub \u2014 infamous Boston watering hole \u2014 and there are at least 50 people, all strangers, here, so... No.) I also know that I was letting down a lot of people I cared about. But I never got anywhere until I thought about where I stood in relation to the dreams I had for my life as a younger man. Then I thought about the gap between those dreams and where things stood as I sat on that stool. Then I asked, \u201cAs a force in my life, is alcohol moving me toward those dreams or away from them?\u201d I did not need to know that I was alcoholic to know the answer.\n\nToday, people ask me if I am an alcoholic. My answer: I\u2019m not sure what that means but I suspect that I would qualify by any definition you would choose. I do know that I\u2019m a guy whose life works a lot better when he doesn\u2019t consume alcohol. That works for me. (To say nothing of the people I care about!)\n\nMaineman",

There are those of us who are not drinking to ward off loneliness or to pretend happiness and extroversion. Some of us do not have deep rooted psychological reasons for it; some of us just enjoy a drink for what it is.",

Despite our decades-long friendship that is almost akin to a family-like relationship, I\u2019m very aggravated by his drinking. It affects our friendship in many ways. I can\u2019t just enjoy a beer with him like I often do with other buddies. With him, there\u2019s always a hidden agenda by him to have 5 beers or 10 beers. I can\u2019t just have 1 with him. On many occasions he\u2019s gotten so drunk while we are out that restaurant staff become concerned. They wonder if he needs to be cut off. Sometimes he has been cut off. Recently, I noticed that staff were making fun of him behind his back as we walked out of a restaurant. I don\u2019t blame them. But this is embarrassing and appalling. \n\nYears ago I confronted him about his drinking. He cut me off and didn\u2019t talk to me for 3 years. So yes, I could confront him again. It would have zero results. I\u2019ve given up. I basically have a deteriorated, low-quality friendship with him because of his drinking, and that\u2019s just the way it is. Apparently he is content with it.",

Full disclosure: I'm a former drinker who too often relied on a Saturday morning beer or two to get the day started. I had given up hard liquor, but had fallen prey to the \"I only drink beer\" myth. Alcohol is alcohol. Yes, some people can drink responsibly. I, however, was among the masses who had a tendency toward addiction. Thank goodness -- and a lot of understanding friends -- it's been more than 35 years since I've had an alcoholic drink. Ironically, the last day I drank began with a few Saturday morning beers -- but continued throughout the day and into the night, much like what will happen with too many of the college-age and older viewers you're targeting. I think your advertising staff and Leo Burnett USA are doing a disservice to too many people who may see this as permission and affirmation to go ahead and have a Saturday morning beer or two. You could have done better.\nSincerely,\nPaul S. Cooper\nSt.  Petersburg FL\n78 years old\n35-plus years alcohol-free",

Your view of AA is quite common among people who are or were struggling. 12 step programs  are not for everyone with a substance use disorder and the focus of treatment now does not revolve around them, though they are seen as a vital tool. Treatment now seems to center upon harm reduction as opposed to abstinence. Counselors and treatment centers accept a commitment to maybe switch from heroin to marijuana, for example, as a positive step.\n\nWhat is most important, though,iss your fearless honesty. I have been in AA for 13 years now. Learning to be honest with myself and the people around me is what finally kept me sober. Looking back, I can see very plainly that the biggest lie I was telling was that I was only hurting myself. The reality was that I was hurting many people as a person with Alcohol Use Disorder; people who were family and close friends, sometimes people who were total strangers.\n\nEven after going into recovery, the harm I did to myself and others to this day remains in some ways. I am slowly rebuilding trust and mutually supportive friendships and that can take a long time. The harm I did to myself, though, has led me to the need for a liver transplant. My future is very uncertain as a result and at this point I can only plead with people who know but ignore warning signs of trouble, to please take them seriously.",

A hangover you might have plowed through at work at 21 will, at 50, morph to three days of total incapacitation if you're lucky, or seizures, or worse, if you're not.\n\n   If one is really not sure, see if you can quit for 3 months.  Or, minimum, 6 weeks.  The latter will get you to \"normal\", and by 3 months, you may actually stop thinking about whether you even want alcohol, let alone need it.\n\n   Drinking can become your routine and daily status quo, and breaking that routine, familiarity, and complacency can make you feel better, not even to mention the physical improvements you feel by breaking the cycle of heavy drinking and getting out of that rut.",

I didn't realize until after I got sober finally that alcohol (or my alcoholism) was using me. I never learned how to live life on life's terms - I kept trying to bend it to my will, and when it didn't, I numbed the pain and frustration with booze. During the Christmas holidays in 1991 I finally realized that my way didn't work. I had no answers, nowhere to turn. That was my bottom. \n\nI went to rehab, came to understand I was an alcoholic, and accepted the fact that I needed help. I began attending AA meetings and followed the suggestions even though I didn't want to - I wasn't sure AA would work, but I WAS sure of one thing: my way did not. So far I haven't taken another drink. \n\nIf you haven't been to AA, I urge you to avail yourself. There you'll find many just like you, and people who can truly understand you, and not judge you.

A few years later, still abstinent, I was sitting around still debating whether I was alcoholic or not and I realized that sitting around questioning my alcoholism a few years after quitting was the strongest piece of evidence I had that I was alcoholic.

My. Grandfather was a classic mean drunk and nasty person. His daughter, my mother, was an angel when sober, and a mess when drunk, which by my teens was daily by after school. I realized i was addicted by the end of my first year at university. And it took 10 years before i hit rock bottom, went to a detox centre in 1983, age 28. I was there a week and haven\u2019t had a drop since, 36 years this past dec. Point one, many alcoholics clearly have an inherited genetic basis for addiction. I\u2019m one of six children, two of us followed the same path. Insiduous because by the time you know you\u2019re hooked, it\u2019s too late, your hooked. It\u2019s not easy quitting. But it was way easier than quitting cigarettes which i only managed to do three years ago, having started about same time as my drinking. It\u2019s also insidious because not everyone is the same. Once the alcohol was out of my bloodstream, largely at the end of the week of detox, i found the physical, \u2018must have it\u2019 cravings disappeared. From there it was just a matter of making up my mind to never touch it again. But that wasn\u2019t the case with many people i\u2019ve known who\u2019ve struggled with alcohol. Some have relapsed many times. Their craving hasn\u2019t disappeared. We should all be careful not to judge. I rarely talk about it, but when i do, it\u2019s to promote understanding.",

It ultimately made me so miserable that I came very close to suicide. At that point, I started using heroin and was too scared to combine it with alcohol, so I stopped drinking. 4 years later (I was a functioning addict, worked and bought my heroin on the dark web and smoked it when I got home) I was not depressed, but I was heavily addicted and broke. I was put on Suboxone 10 mg and Effexor 150 mg which I supplemented with cannabis whenever I had heroin cravings.\n\n2 years later that remains my medication regimen. I hope to wean off the Suboxone when I feel stable enough, as I still struggle with heavy depression and Suboxone has an anti-depressant effect, especially in combination with Effexor. I haven\u2019t touched a drop of booze since I quit 5 years ago. My drinking years had a profound effect on my cognition and ability to think clearly, which I still struggle with. I think it\u2019s by far the most devastating drug out there in terms of physical and cognitive decline, increased risk of cancers etc. \n\nJust wanted to add my story to show others sometimes the path towards giving up drinking isn\u2019t as simple as suddenly deciding to try for total sobriety.

But my mother was a serious alcoholic-many hospitalizations, car wrecks, house fires, every relationship in her life destroyed by toxic , out of control speech and behaviors. It killed her but not soon enough. The last 10 years were terrible to behold. And yes , we tried to help, rescue, intervene for decades.\nSo growing up like that one always worries. A score on an alcohol use survey is peripheral. I also enjoy my nightly ritual. I stop for periods of time-either as a mindfulness exercise-it is good for that, to try to lose weight-2 months without an India pale ale recently and not a single ounce lost. Right now I'm taking a sulfa antibiotic and one does not mix them with alcohol. I'm fine with the hibiscus tea tonight. But I don't drink wine or hard liquor. I think both of those are harder on the system because they are too concentrated. Beer suits me ; they are so good in these days of craft breweries. People should quit if they want to but I don't think it is bad for everyone. Good reflection from Ms. Wartik about the dangers-ruined relationships and physical symptoms the next day are red flags.",

So, they drink more, increasing the after effects on the body and then they need more the next day to try to overcome the abuse of the previous day.\n\nI have long believed that the single minded approach of AA is too all or nothing. It is also modeled on the Christian idea of salvation, in this case salvation from alcohol rather than from sin generally which doesn't work for a lot of people. It requires a kind of surrender from which, it is hoped, a new person can arise.\n\nThis column, as well as recent research, recognizes there are different levels of alcohol dependence, which require varied approaches.\n\nOne more thing: if someone is addicted to heroin or opioids, we don't have a name like heroinized or opioidic, yet we label people locked into alcohol as alcoholics, as if their whole lives have been buried in alcohol. The name itself is too harsh and implies the person has disappeared.",

Any time a substance, whether food, drink, smoke, hobby, relationship controls a person and makes that person feel not good then it is time to tame it and take strong action.\n\nThe author's story is clear to me that she should heed the lessons learned for the rest of her life and not indulge in alcohol because it is not good for her. \n\nOn the other hand I learned very young that I had no interest in drinking either a drink that did not taste good whether hard liquor or soda pop (both of which I do not like). Also after a modest amount of wine, it simply does not taste quite as good so I stop.\n\nModeration has left me without hangovers, inebriation and regrets. Also, because the alcohol never reaches a level that I have been affected in my behavior I have no regrets about actions either. I feel blessed to have the enjoyment without a price to be paid afterward, but I know that there are people for whom any amount of alcohol, drugs, gambling, collecting, etc is too much.",

In both cases alcohol \"loosened them up\" and allowed them to be charming, outgoing and dynamic, but in both cases that loosening up then progressed to them being abusive, paranoid and violent.  It seemed that the \"empowering\" or \"self-medicating\" effects of the alcohol became central to their sense of security or self-esteem, while ironically undermining those very things, along with their relationships with many people, especially those closest to them.  One thing in this article that resonated strongly with me was the idea that, insofar as alcohol leads you to wreck your relationships with others, including partners and children, then that is a real problem regardless of what name one applies to it.  In my experience that is definitely a useful measure of how much is too much.",

He already had severe cirrhosis. My son's grandfather on his father's side was also a rather vicious alcoholic.\nI came VERY close myself. I drank pretty much every day from my 20's on, and I drank a LOT, day and night. It seemed that everyone I knew did, but I believe I took it further. Once you ask yourself if you might be an alcoholic, you're already in trouble.\nI did not drink a drop when I was pregnant with my son. Once he was born, I generally waited until nighttime to drink, but once I got started I drank a lot. In our genteel neighborhood, the parents would sit together on the stoops of our brownstones and get trashed on decent wine while our children played.\nI finally stopped drinking altogether for about 8 years. I didn't like my son seeing me that way. Now I drink very occasionally, and fortunately no longer enjoy inebriation as I used to.\nWhen my son was about to go to college, I reminded him over and over that alcoholism runs in the family on both sides. I told him that if he drank at all, he should keep it to one or two glasses--and that if he couldn't stop at that, he should stop altogether. I also told him that if he felt he needed to choose a substance, he should stick to cannabis (he's in a legal state, and is now 21). So far, so good.\nThank you for this honest piece.",

I stopped drinking six years ago, and my life changed rapidly and for the better.  That regained self-confidence you speak of quickly fills the void that the alcohol never could.  Addiction has become so stigmatized in our society that people think their only option once they've identified they have a problem is to attach the label of \"addict\" or \"alcoholic\" to themselves.  There's a whole middle road between normal and addict, and one that can become problematic for many people.  If you're allergic to shrimp, and shrimp makes your throat swell up, you're probably not going to eat shrimp.  Why can't it be as simple as that in regards to alcohol?",

Well, my friends\u2019 parents drank beer and wine at dinner and I didn\u2019t see the big deal. I thought my parents were crazy. \n\nSo when I got to college, after living under this Puritanical regime for 18 years, I started drinking. Why wouldn\u2019t beer and wine give me a buzz like it gave my friends? Why did I need straight whisky? Well, according to ancestry.com, it has something to do with Scotland LOL. Point is, I realized that my parents were so adamantly opposed to having alcohol in the house because they knew that they carried this predisposition to become alcoholics.\n\nWhen I did the ancestry.com DNA thing, I learned that I am a carrier for hemochromatosis, which is an iron disorder that mainly erodes the liver and leads to premature death if left untreated. One grandfather lived to nearly 90 and the other died at 68 with cirrhosis. Why does alcohol affect people so differently?  I have often wondered if hemochromatosis is what caused my dad\u2019s dad to develop cirrhosis when mom\u2019s dad didn\u2019t.\n\nAnyway, I think the gist of the alcohol story is that some people just can\u2019t drink in moderation due to genetic differences. It\u2019s why I don\u2019t touch the hard stuff anymore. A glass of wine now and then for the heart, but keep that whisky away from me. Freedom and whisky gang together, true.

The \"boring transcenders\".\n\nWhen asking drinkers why they don't like pot they usually say \"makes me think too much\"- which is what they need more of I think. They don't like facing themselves.\n\nDrinkers usually combine it with work colleagues, are \"over-achievers\" and don't like the pot smokers perceived \"idleness\" and \"non go getting\". They often like also like cocaine for this reason. \n\nMarijuana does all the things the author wanted. Naturally effects the cannabinoid section of the brain to relieve stress, bring euphoria, thoughtfulness to oneself, others, and surroundings. It often brings creativity and compassion. All the opposite of alcohol and the \"competors\" who can gravitate toward it.\n\n If one can actually get addicted to pot it would have none of the bad outcomes the author had, in my experience.\n\nAnd it costs less.",

It boils down to an honest assessment of how one feels about drinking when there is a habitual, unhealthy amount of over drinking in someone's life, as was the case with me.  I went to treatment and joined AA.  AA is full of problems but there are people there like me (atheist/agnostic) who find each other and develop friendships that are deep and meaningful.  There is safety in numbers.  Years later, no drinking for a decade, I don't miss it at all.  Life is much nicer on this side of the tracks.  I have friends who over drink and call me to say things like \"I need to cut down\" or who do Dryuaray.  I stopped completely.  I don't worry about it.  I don't know which is worse.  Getting so bad you need treatment, but stopping altogether and living life without it or the slow agony that comes with the inability to put it down when you know it's not good for you.  Actually I do know which is worse and that would be to continue to allow it to drag me around like a ball and chain.  I take a life without alcohol any day.",

We don't drink because we're depressed, we drink because it feels great.  We should cut down, for health reasons, but that easily gets lost when the cultural narrative is always that you quit because it's \"ruining your life.\"  What if it's not ruining your life?  I'm happy, healthy, sleep well, exercise a lot, and have no desire whatsoever to stop drinking, except that I know it's unhealthy.  Nobody in my social circle needs to apologize to people who have been hurt by our drinking, because nobody has ever been hurt by our drinking.  This clich\u00e9 that sooner or later alcohol destroys everything in your life just isn't true for so many of us who still, in fact, drink too much for our health.  Like the corny War on Drugs commercials in the 80's, we can't take seriously the melodramatic warnings that drinking destroys you and everyone you love, because for us, it doesn't. So we stop listening, and keep drinking.  Alcoholism is usually defined as a drinking \"problem,\" so when people don't see problems due to their drinking, they don't realize they're drinking too much.  Nobody says you should stop eating doughnuts because they're destroying your relationships and your family.  I wish reducing alcohol consumption could be treated the same way, as a pure health benefit, without the high drama about \"problems,\" \"diseases,\" and other humiliating terminology.",

It is compared to an allergy, but I find it much more comparable to the disease of diabetes.  I have known so many alcoholics who are in recovery and are later diagnosed as diabetic or borderline diabetic, including myself.  AA groups often keep candy handy for the alcoholic who still has the shakes.  I have seen very little research on the association of alcoholism and diabetes, but the only way to describe my craving for alcohol is the way I feel after eating one glazed donut or a piece of chocolate cake.  I HAVE TO keep eating, and I don't know where or when I will stop.  And, yes, alcoholism is a physical disease.  It progresses to the point that the only nourishment the body can absorb comes from alcohol, or so I've been told.  By the way, AA takes NO POSITION on the institution of drinking and is not a cult.  There are no leaders, and no one will try to keep you coming to meetings if you prefer to drink or find some other alternative that works.  It's strictly for those who WANT it, not for those who need it.",

I have just finished the most intense year and a half of my life, where almost everything I\u2019ve known, has changed.   Tequila was my coping mechanism.  It started with just a couple shots to take the edge off on a Friday evening, into a full blown, drinking everyday, mess.  Sadly for me, I can really drink a lot without getting really messed up.  Or,  rather it takes a lot for me to really get drunk, and the more I had the more I needed to blunt my difficult days.  \n   I finally figured out that the drinking doesn\u2019t help with the issues, it just lets you set them aside for now.   They\u2019re still there when you wake up in the morning.  Then, just as the author says, you\u2019re ashamed.  So, I decided that this was going to be the year.   I\u2019m tackling my \u201cstuff\u201d head on, dealing with it, and staying sober.  I\u2019ve lost a bit of weight, already, just for cutting out the alcohol.

But I find that I, once again, quit drinking for January- to the annoyance of my husband, who loves his wine- and an occasional Scotch- every day. But with my history of severe reflux, and 2 fundoplications under my belt to control it, I finally decided to quit, for good. \n\nMy dad was a terrible alcoholic- beat me unconscious when I was 17, and didn't remember it. My mom told me later that he had 'blackouts'- of course, I thought, how convenient. My sister died of heart failure at age 56, way too young, and although the doctors thought it was precipitated by a 'virus' attacking her heart, I believe it was her drinking. She drank a lot- to the point of passing out- was a bartender for 20 yrs. Another sister is a high functioning alcoholic at the moment. My third sister had to quit also due to health concerns,\n\nThe bonus? My mind is clearer, my short term memory is better, my skin looks less congested and clearer. I sleep better. I can ignore the little snippy comments when I refuse a glass of wine, and enjoy my tonic water or club soda instead. where I'm living right now, it's especially hard, since it seems everyone drinks. \n\nGoing forward, I think I can reserve my wine for rare, special occasions, and stop at one glass.",

Medical imaging is just beginning to be able to see the difference between addict\u2019s and non-addicts brains when exposed to the substance/behavior of one\u2019s addiction. We certainly don\u2019t know what those differences might mean, much less have a way to fix it.\n\nIn a nutshell, addiction represents use (continued, progressive, compulsive) despite often similarly progressive negative consequences. Take DUI. Most people who get a DUI never get another one. The avalanche of consequences is more than sufficient for people to change their alcohol use, if not stop imbibing entirely. \n\nComplicating matters is the incidence of co-occurring mental health issues. Many addicts start using as a method of self-medicating mental health and social functioning issues (depression, social anxiety, etc.) One of the most significant is the presence of emotional regulation issues that affect nearly all, if not all addicts. In fact, 12 step programs, especially \u201cthe inventory,\u201d can be conceptualized, in part, as a program of treatment and management of emotional regulation issues. Finally, developmental trauma is nearly ubiquitous in addict populations. \n\nThat said, addiction remains otherwise and overall, poorly understood with relatively low long-term recovery rates, no matter the treatment. In the end, addiction will kill most people who acquire it, be it booze, cigarettes, gambling, sex, food, etc\u2026.\n\n\n.",

They can guess.   But that is not their job.  Including your kids.\nPlay it safe.  Don''t drink at all if you think you might say something hurtful.   In some cases it will take a very long time to repair the damage, and in some cases it can't be repaired, in part because the listener thinks less of you for having imbibed enough to act like a jerk.  They wonder what you are like as a composite, with or without alcohol.",

To get there, I drank at the professional alcoholic level for 30 years, wrecking careers, marriages, friendships, everything.  When I came to AA I was living in a SUV.  They said \"If you don't like what we have, we'll cheerfully refund your misery.\"  I stayed.  It worked, and works, for me.  AA's not for everyone, and, indeed, many leave.  To stay usually requires a hard bottom, as it did for those who founded the program. \n\nOne thing's certain, though: if those who are having a \"problem\" with alcohol, it's pretty likely they'll ride the elevator to the basement unless they find a way off.  No matter how it's called, alcoholism is an incredibly ugly disease that does terrible damage to the alcoholic and all around him/her.  Alcohol may be legal, and so is not given the concern it merits.  Paying heed would be wise.",

Long ago, those of us in the profession and in the ranks made it simple. If you gotta ask, you don't gotta ask. If you keep taking tests on whether or not you \"have a problem\", you don't need to take any more tests.    If you drink and it causes a problem and you continue to use, you are an alcoholic and need help (\"self-help\" is redundant -- if you could help yourself, you don' t need help). If you count your drinks, if you stop for a month (only alcoholics NEED to stop drinking -- everyone else does not have a problem), if you get comments repeatedly about your drinking.. the list goes on and on. But save yourself the anxiety of the label. Bite the bullet and ask for help.. it is the only way. It is the ONLY way.  It is such a relief!   And .. no one ever suffered as a result of a \"misdiagnosis\" of alcoholism. As Lancet points out. skip the booze for health anyway. PS, I see the psychologists saying we don't need to label someone an \"alcoholic\". Why not??  it is a disease not a shameful disgrace. We need to recognize that and make it what it is .. and take a practical successful path to recovery....",

Never mind that I was quite, what I called at the time, a \"responsible\" drinker. I can now admit to many regretful things that occurred because of my drinking. I was starting to have anxiety leading up to concert nights or camping trips, anything where alcohol would be involved. I took several lengthy breaks over the years, then drinking cautiously at first, eventually to have a night where the partying was excessive and bad feelings ensued. \n\nWhat I never expected was how utterly positive this choice has been for me. It is one of the best decisions I have ever made without a doubt. It was incredibly freeing and has led to many positive things in my life. Reading the book This Naked Mind by Annie Bloom really helped me to reframe my thinking on alcohol. Now, I still love to party and can dance harder than anyone in the room, while sober. It wasn't the alcohol making things better, it was my friends, the music, the time spent together. I encourage anyone out there thinking about leaving behind alcohol...do it. It will be a huge, positive change in your life! You will save money and find time you didn't realize you had.  My husband has really decreased his drinking and we are a happy healthy family.

It highlights lots of insidious problems that complicate alcohol awareness. \n\nThe \"standard\" drink has 0.6 ounces of alcohol, like a 12-ounce beer with 5% alcohol. But many (delicious) beers have 1.5 to 2 times that much. Having a pint gets you there too. It's easy to pour much more wine or spirits than the skimpy-looking standard in a glass. \n\nTwo drinks, then, is probably three. That puts many people in a higher risk category than they acknowledge. It also makes the threshold for risk dismissively low. \n\nSevere abuse renders such spectacularly bad consequences that even routine hangovers and regrettable behavior seem pretty tame in comparison. It's easy to justify a \"reasonable\" position between rock-bottom abuse and insufferable teetotalism. \n\nClearly alcohol consumption is toxic and risky. But it's one of many bad-for-you indulgences. We're better off avoiding them all. But that's a pretty joyless prospect. And more severe indulgence driven by victimization and hard times seems pretty forgivable. \n\nLearning to hold your liquor is practically a rite of passage. Drinking the most while incurring the least unfavorable consequences is a perverse triumph. But it's a useful skill even in the author's vaunted lifestyle. \n\nI suppose it catches up with you, sooner or later, as with the author. The article helped me sort some things out.

I have never had the experience of wanting to drink \"more\" or wanting to drink to make certain negative feelings go away or whatever other people do. I do not \"lose control\" in any way due to the consuption of alcohol. I don't puke or pass out.  I go weeks/months without any alcohol and don't miss it.

I had surrounded myself with friends who drank as much if not more than I, and they were baffled by my frequent attempts to go on the wagon.\n\nI was fortunate to find a local Smart Recovery chapter, and after perhaps a dozen meetings, I understood that the pattern of one drink turning into eight would always repeat itself.\n\nShortly after my last drink, I met my future husband, and we now have a baby on the way.

If I didn\u2019t go to therapy, I\u2019d eventually drink daily.\nAA saved me. They waited for me as I continued to relapse. They never pushed me to do anything but shared their own stories.

It is necessary in a culture that perpetuates and stigmatizes human suffering. \n\nThe book \u201cThis Naked Mind\u201d by Annie Grace helped me see how our beliefs around alcohol are shaped by marketing campaigns and social conditions that make you think you\u2019re weak if you can\u2019t \u201chandle\u201d your drink.

I don't think it is worse than alcohol but, as this article describes, a lot of people are harming themselves with alcohol even if they remain largely functional in their jobs and families.\n\nMarijuana is now legal to consume in Massachusetts but neither marijuana nor tobacco can be smoked inside the apartment complex I live in. I see both tobacco and marijuana sitting huddled on walls at the property boundary smoking. And it strikes me that, if you are huddled on a concrete wall in 20 degree weather at 9pm smoking either weed or a cigarette... You have a problem. But these folks don't seem to recognize it.",

I was in luck, because he said there was an out-patient program beginning that night.  I went to the program for six weeks.  I then attended  an addiction group therapy session for three years.  During this period I went to AA meeting for six years.  It has been over twenty years since I had a drink.   It is difficult to stop drinking because you have to change your lifestyle.  You have to lose your friends who have the same drinking problems.  You need help to stop.",

It suggests that drinking is like heroin addiction, that once you start, you are permanently hooked, and that the only solution is permanent abstinence. This all or nothing view of drinking is not accurate for every person, though for some it certainly is. For most of us, it is reasonable to say that we have control of our drinking; that it is merely a choice. That this isn\u2019t true for everyone is a reality, but that doesn\u2019t mean that abstinence should be the automatic choice for everyone.\n\nDrinking has been around for a substantial portion of human history, largely because for most of us it is pleasurable. That this is true doesn\u2019t keep others from experiencing the issues outlined by Ms. Wartik. The point is that one must exercise self-discipline, must have the power to say no appropriately. That doesn\u2019t work for everyone: for them total abstinence is a reasonable choice. Even for those who can make it work most of the time, we may still have occasions when we exceed our limits. If one\u2019s experience is as Ms. Wartik\u2019s, then one can reasonably believe that total abstinence is a better choice. But millions of people do OK without that extremity, and don\u2019t need to be preached to.\n\nHumans often have a tendency to generalize from our own experiences to form conclusions about the whole of humankind, but that often is an ill informed choice.",

I do not drink, and my sister only occasionally will. We have both sought help, or dealt in our own ways, with our parents' drinking, though not very successfully. I will send my sister this article, but sending it our parents would be a waste of time, especially at their age, and that makes me very angry and very sad.

Kudos to you, for being able to control your drinking on your own. What's different between us is that I could not control my drinking on my own, which is why I identify as an alcoholic. I feel no shame in that, no more so than if I had diabetes .... and I identified as a diabetic. Again for me, I needed help to stop drinking, and I found that help in AA. I say without any hesitation, that AA saved my life. Not only that, AA has given me a life beyond my wildest dreams. It has been a little over twenty four years since my last drink, but I don't believe that I am cured of my alcoholism. With the help of AA, I still stay sober just one day at a time. My advice to those who think they have a drinking problem would be this  .....  if you can stop drinking on your own .... then hat's off to you ! But if you are like me, get over the stigma of the word alcoholic, and get yourself into AA.   Lastly, it's also highly recommended that when you stop, that you are medically supervised when you detox. Good luck, and God Bless !",

I always got the result I wanted that I am a \u201cmoderate drinker \u201c, but deep inside my heart I knew something is not right. I would dunk 2 shooters of gin or vodka hidden in my car, before I drank the recommended \u201c A glass or 2 of wine \u201c. The quality time in the evening that I could have spent with my family or reading a book was wasted often quarreling with my wife, mother or sister about useless petty issues. \n\nAlcohol degraded my sleep at night and sapped me of energy during the day. It also trapped me in a mindset where I was subconsciously seeking my drink every evening, vetoing plans like going out with kids where I knew I won\u2019t be able to drink.\n\nIt is very difficult to disentangle oneself from the lust of alcohol, since alcohol almost becomes like a companion for the evening. I still occasionally have a drink with old friends, but that occasional drink can be a slippery slope and I have to actively guard against it.",

I sleep better and wake refreshed\u2014 but not all the time.  I certainly save money.\u2014 but not that I\u2019m much.  And, I was sure I would lose weight\u2014 but no!   Dull family gatherings are duller.  Dinners out and parties are way less inviting.  \u201cLet\u2019s go for a drink!\u201d Yay. I get to look forward to $6 seltzer, watered down with too much ice. In general many of the things that I enjoyed are not just not the same.  \nI am however, enjoying life just fine. It\u2019s just different in a way that I hadn\u2019t anticipated.  Maybe I thought I\u2019d be somehow dramatically renewed.  \nI write this because I think that in many of these articles there\u2019s an overstatement of how much one\u2019s life will change.  All you may gain may just be having some nights of better sleep\u2014 and knowing that your liver and kidneys are much happier.   It\u2019s enough for me.

One person in my life who identifies as an alcoholic says that she used to Google \u201chow to drink normally.\u201d That\u2019s obsession. I dated a man who didn\u2019t drink for a year to prove to himself that he wasn\u2019t an alcoholic. That\u2019s obsession. Alcoholism is a mental, physical and spiritual malady. I have many addicts in my family, I just didn\u2019t I inherit this issue. It\u2019s the luck of the draw, entirely. Drinking problems are not moral or willpower issues. As for the people who say that it\u2019s so hard not to drink in a social setting, it\u2019s pretty easy. Just be honest. Anyone who had a problem with you not drinking is likely to have their own problem. Alcohol makes me depressed, so I rarely drink.

I'm your opposite, raised by two Euro parents who'd have 2-3 martinis or scotches before dinner, a bottle of wine with it and a couple of aperitifs later. \n\nMy father also made wine. At around 15, I started stealing his stock to drink with friends. I viewed it as payment for him making me wash hundreds of wine bottles.\n\nLeft home at 16, went to work thousands of miles away on a job where everyone got drunk every night. Got in with that handily.\n\nAt 33, became an expat in Asia, where almost every expat is a boozer, some of them epically so, but functional enough to hang onto serious jobs and lives. Me too.\n\nAt around 40, I came back home and dialed it back significantly, sometimes going days without a drop. Then I got diagnosed with gout. It was awful. A serious rock climber, I thought it was tied to my agonizingly tight climbing shoes (and love of dark beer). \n\nSo I went on allopurinol, and to give my organs a rest, quit for 365 days, on my Dad's b-day so we could clink glasses at year's end. No cravings, but THE most boring year of my life. My wife was begging me to drink (she doesn't), saying I was moody, restless, no fun.\n\nDid the year, resumed the booze. Wife was happy. I was happy. That was 15 yrs ago. \n\nI did a sober November in 2019, liked it, but again, the wife. I counter it by working out hard 12+ hrs a week, hydrating like a big tuna. I drink probably too much, but get no hangovers.\n\nLife and wife are good.",

I stopped drinking about 8 years ago.  For many years, I regularly had two very nice sized vodka martinis every evening 7 days a week and for very much the same reasons and with very much the same effects as the writer of this essay so clearly articulates.  Then I woke up one morning with terrible pains in my abdomen and after rolling on the floor in pain and on the couch all day, that evening my wife and I went to the ER where I was told I had pancreatitis.  This dangerous, possibly fatal condition can be brought on by long term  alcohol consumption.  The doctor told me that if I wanted to  live a long life I had better stop drinking.

Allen Carr's book \"The Easy Way to Quit Drinking\" probably had the biggest impact on my ability to quit. It helped  change the way I looked at alcohol, and I started seeing it for what it really was and what it really did to me. And one day, I just had a similar epiphany to the author of this article. I realized it wasn't worth it. Yes, sometimes when I drank, everything was fine and I had a great time. Other times, I made a fool of myself, I hurt people I love, I put myself in risky situations. After a while, trying to control drinking so I had more of the good experiences became too much work. Admittedly, in the first few sober months, I kind of dropped out and isolated myself. I watched a lot of Law and Order. (A lot.) I just couldn't be around people who were drinking or talking about drinking (When I did go to AA meetings, I personally found it was hard to listen to so many people talk about drinking). Now, I can go to parties with lots of drinking and I have no issue declining drinks. The only weird thing is, even six years later, I'm not always comfortable telling people I am sober. It's usually in professional situations like at conferences. I'll say I'm tired, or I'm trying to get pregnant, or I am not feeling well. I'm not quite sure why that is but am glad more people, like the author, are getting comfortable telling others they don't drink.",

Once alcoholism sets in, it seems to have a life of its own and needs to be treated as an independent disorder. \n\nYour other important point is that gratitude, not fear, is a chief motivator for recovery. In that sense, sobriety becomes its own reward. Fear helps initially, but gratitude is better in the long run. \n\nAnd finally, as Bill W said (and Bill White and Anne Fletcher have demonstrated, \u201cAA has no monopoly on recovery\u201d there\u2019s lots of paths to recovery.",

However as I entered my late 50s, I realized that I was looking the other way with several close friends and family members whose drinking was causing havoc in their lives, and often mine.  Was I enabling them?  Very likely. I worked with a therapist.  I finally chose to talk privately to each of them about some of their hurtful behavior towards me, and how I couldn't ignore my feelings of hurt and being disrespected. I followed exactly what the therapist and I had worked on.  One told me to F off, he would always choose drinking over me (I hadn't asked him to.)  One started drinking more, calling me nightly and leaving abusive messages for me. That went on until I blocked his calls.  One family member decided to cut me out of her life, then told her adolescent daughters (with whom I was close) that I was unstable and had had a series of abortions and suicide attempts. (All false.)  My nieces then cut off contact with me.  Working with my therapist I realized that I had to stop my relationships with them and move forward.  Alcohol abuse ripples outward.  If you are struggling with a loved ones alcohol use, please consider seeking professional help.",

In the early days -- frightened by disastrous relapse stories of people who had gotten away from support resources, I promised to protect myself by going to meetings for support \"most of the time.\"   \n\nLater, I utilized other fellowships for children of dysfunctional and addicted families, to focus on the unresolved childhood trauma that had continued to influence me in adult life.   \n\nNow, 47 years of continuous sobriety later, I continue to go to AA meetings \u201cmost of the time\u201d (at least 4 times a week, the way many people go to the gym) --  not because I\u2019m afraid of drinking today, but because every day is full of small and large  \"emotional emergencies\", and how well I handle them will determine how happy I am.

It was a \"medical model\" rehab, which teaches that alcoholism is a physiological disease with psycho-social consequences.  It made sense to me based on my experience, and I did three weeks in Rehab and have been sober now for 36 years.\n\nHowever it's defined, alcoholism is a scourge that kills and harms not only the alcoholics, but their families and friends.  I wish Ms. Wartik a long and sober life.",

As a writer and creator, I couldn't produce without drinking -- a lot, wine and beer mostly. Since I quit about a year ago (after more than 40 years of heavy drinking), I've managed to produce exactly nothing, have lost most my artistic and writer friends, and now have a pretty much zero social life. I'm starting to sleep better, have lost weight, am fitter, have better blood pressure and blood glucose levels, am clearer headed and enjoy better memory, but am far from satisfied. I only stay sober because I know that continuing to drink will kill me; there's loads of irreparable damage already. All the happy transformational stories about sobriety are pretty biased and one-sided, in my view. Like smoking, I was keener mentally and far more productive when I smoked than anytime after I quit 35 years ago. But quit one must after the health implications become clear, not from the science, but from the implosion of personal health. Grief over quitting isn't irrational; there are real benefits to drinking (and smoking for that matter). I also note that the bevy of stories in recent times come from people who didn't drink all that much -- just occasionally enough to make fools of themselves, which is pretty easy, to be sure.",

I am a mere 10 days into my new healthier life without it. For me, it was impossible to \"cut back\". One glass of wine always lead to more. Though not a fan of self help books, the book  \"Alcohol Explained\" by William Porter was instrumental in my decision to quit. It is written by an alcoholic who is now sober. He answers questions that doctors and researchers don't....like why is it easier to have no drinks than just one. \n\nIn the U.S., wine is being marketed heavily to women; a huge change from when I was young. The purveyors of booze have succeeded in making it seem socially acceptable for women to \"love their wine\".  Don't buy the hype....it's much easier to never start drinking than to stop. If it is any comfort to those considering quitting, the physical withdrawal lasts only a few days. For me, it was about the same as the typical hangover. Yesterday my husband told me he was proud of me, and I told him that I'm proud of me too.",

Not the worst night of my life, by far, but I heard the voice that said, \"I can never do this again.\" And I haven't. For me, AA has been a godsend. The structure, the support, the path to getting honest with myself -- after I gave up drinking, I had to look closely at my pill use. It was also quite a problem (alcohol and drug abusers have an incredible ability to fool ourselves, so if it seems crazy that I stopped drinking but kept using and abusing pain killers, Xanax, ambient, marijuana, etc, that's the nature of addiction.)Today, I have had nothing stronger than a Tylenol in 6 months, and not a sip of alcohol in almost 2 years. \n\nAnd like the author, Oh.My.God. My life.  I never thought I would be this happy. I have found so much more peace, and the damage my drinking did to my self-esteem is immeasurable. For years I begged shrinks to tell me how to like myself more -- waking up every day feeling ashamed and that I'd let myself down and put myself at risk was causing so much of my anguish.  I also finally treated my depression. \n\nWhen I first stopped drinking, I was angry and envious. Why couldn't  I drink like a \"normal\" person. Certainly I wansn't that bad - I was a bon vivant! But I came  to realize that if anything else in my life made me feel as awful as booze, I would never touch it again.",

When my doctor asked me every year how many drinks I had per week, I'd always say something like, a glass with dinner, and then I'd walk out just knowing that I'd low-balled that estimate for sure. But all I could think about was how impossible it would be to break this lovely lovely habit. I attend work events all the time - how do you explain having a club soda when everyone else is trying the expensive wines paraded out to impress our clients? Then one day I woke up in the morning after not having slept through the night for weeks. I was literally in tears.

The combination of wanting to turn the tragedy of my divorce into triumph, the realization that fear was a factor in my drinking and the \"challenge\" of trying to be in that 5% are what pushed me to stop. \n\nAlthough I sometimes drink now, I do not feel the urge to like I did when I was drinking often.

            "comment_body": "After the 2016 election I joked that I lay down on the sofa with a glass of wine in one hand and pint of ice cream in the other for over 2 years. But it was no joke. Last fall I became violently ill for no apparent reason about every 2 or 3 weeks. Upshot, tests showed elevated liver enzymes. I stopped drinking. It was shockingly easy. Within 3 weeks I felt a completely different person.  Having suffered from depression pretty much my whole life, I knew alcohol was considered a depressant but I used it to self-medicate anyway. Not a lot, one or two glasses of wine a day, maybe a half a bottle with dinner on the weekend. But once I stopped my mind is clearer. I'm sleeping better. I have more energy. But the best result is my mental state. My dogged twins of anxiety and depression have lifted. I had no idea how much alcohol was depressing me. From now on I'll use alcohol very sparingly, to celebrate a special occasion. I did have a small glass of champagne on New Year's Eve. It was delicious and I've had no desire for more. \nThe entire experience has been a revelation for me. That my drinking was a habit, a bad habit; alcohol truly is a depressant, and it's not that hard to change something you feared would be impossible.\nThank you for sharing your experience with us.",

Most people in her position won't. She states that she has a lot of reasons pulling her in the right direction; she wants to be a good mother, wife, relative and friend. She doesn't mention counseling. That makes her an outlier. \n\nMy late brother struggled with alcoholism, losing everything. Job, wife, friends, self respect, back teeth. A judge ruling on his DWI gave him a choice which included AA which in turn was his ramp off the addiction highway that runs down every street in the USA. A witty, intellectual character, he shared lessons on his road to sobriety, within and outside of his AA meetings. He managed to build a new life of service; mentoring young first time offenders upon their release from prison, teaching art to handicapped adults, working on his own art and music. His sobriety unlocked his true potential. When he died on his 58th birthday of complications from his previous addiction(s), a line of 400 people led into the funeral parlor.\n\nMy brother would read Nancy's story and be happy for her. But he would also caution people that found themselves looking lovingly at a glass of wine or a fancy drink;\n\n\"Don't try this by yourself at home. Get professional help.\"  \n\nHe'd be right.",

It doesn\u2019t matter where you are a daily drinker or a periodic binge drinker. You can not with certainty control your drinking under every circumstance. This may or may not cause problems big enough for you to want to quit. If you want to quit because your drinking is causing problems with relationships at home or at work or your health is suffering, then it becomes very tricky as real Alcoholics and addicts find that it\u2019s difficult. The craving and instant relief from what ails you pulls you back to that first drink that causes the cycle to begin again. AA is the place to go if one has a problem with Alcohol.

To make it clear the recommendation for women is one-none per day.  One drink is defined as 5ounces of wine.  A single 5-ounce glass of wine because of my tolerance level has virtually no effect on me. Even when I haven't drunk for long periods of time(ranging from months to years), my tolerance level goes back up after one or two days.  I'm genetically Scottish and German. I metabolize it very quickly even if I do feel a single glass and the effects wear off.  \n\nSo, I can quit or limit to say only weekends.  But I find this challenging because I enjoy the relaxing effect and like I said my life is otherwise unaffected.  I don't drink when I have to drive somewhere, feel no compulsion to drink during the day even when others are because it makes me tired.  I don't drink to mask my feelings or cope.  I don't get drunk or act differently towards others. I have zero interest in partying.   But I may be impacting my long term health.  \n\nSo, right now it's just that right now the motivation is hard to come up with.  Also, I eat healthily and exercise regularly. Maybe in a few years when we become empty nesters, I can relax by reading in the evenings instead.  But right now I'm working 10-12 hour days and managing two middle schoolers.",

At the end of the quiz he had a perfect score. He NEVER drank to excess, he NEVER had a hangover, he NEVER had more than one drink. Soooo.... lucky for you that you quit. I did when I was 28.  Life has been sweet since.",

Might I suggest that she was minimizing her drinking?  It's very common for us to do that, especially in the first months of sobriety.  We don't want people to think we were too bad of a drunk. Also, if you tells yourself you weren't that bad, you can also justify the odd \"celebratory drink\" which, as most of us know, can lead to relapse (been there, drank the wine).\n\nModerate drinkers don't bray loudly about a friend's secret to a group of other friends.  They don't pick senseless drunken quarrels with bereaved friends.  These are the acts of a person whose inhibitions and good sense have been drowned in alcohol. People who drink moderately don't wake up with massive hangovers. They don't have trouble skipping a few nights of drinking.\n\nSorry, Nancy, but your drinking was a lot farther along than you care to admit.  In order to stay sober you have to face up to that.  You're probably a full-blown alcoholic.  Don't minimize that.  That way lies defeat.",

Also, I suspect your elation over drinking amounted to release from one or two things that your sober mind could not accept. If you want serenity, you have to just accept things that are beyond your control. Finally, if you can\u2019t stop permanently, get help. It\u2019s hard to stop by yourself.

I was drinking between a pint and a quart of vodka a day when I was digging my bottom. I classify that as severe.  And it was.  I am grateful I walked into my first A.A. meeting January 21st, 2011.  I just celebrated 9 years of sobriety.\n\nAs a result of the stupid choices I made while being drunk I ultimately got rigorously honest about them and surrendered my law license in 2013.  I took the Bar Exam for the 2nd time last February (1st time was 1983) and passed.  My petition to be reinstated as an attorney is currently pending before the Missouri Supreme Court.  \n\nThank you, Nancy, for your candor and integrity.  I also have discovered a wonderful life I never thought possible in sobriety.  There are many ways to find not just physical sobriety, but also mental, emotional and spiritual.  I am grateful you found your path to sobriety.   Marc B.\n\nPS:  I love A.A.  It saved my life.",

The wedding was a riotous drunken affair, and afterwards I, and my liver, were done. For my friend, (really), who now goes to AA it with the trigger for a week long series of excess. Every night I saw someone drink to the point of vomiting, and was hungover the next morning, limiting our touristing adventures. Don\u2019t judge about my not intervening. We were kids just out of college and I had no idea what if anything to do. What we did do is talk about it, and I said when I have a drink, the more I drink, the less I like it and the more I tasted the alcohol. For her it was the opposite. She said the more she drank the less she tasted it and the more she wanted it. It was eye opening for me. I thought that there but for the grace of God go I. Yes if one never has a drink, it cannot become a problem, but what random genetic luck on my part that when I went to a college party I did not have an AHA! moment I would have thought \u201cwhere were you (alcohol, opiates, benzos) in my life you are what I have been missing?\u201d  \n\nI commend the author and my friend for staring down demons every day.

You described how I acted and felt for years, especially that point in time when I started to wonder \"do I have a drinking problem\"? The answer came crashing down on me 2 years ago when, after a series of personal losses, I slid way down the rabbit hole into a place of drinking vodka straight from the bottle and total despair.\nFast forward, I am now 18 months sober and couldn't be happier. And, by the way, I am 70. You touched on some important points. Not only do women not tolerate alcohol as well, it is especially true for older women. Also, thank you for your explanation of \"Alcohol Use Disorder\". Not only does it sound so much kinder than \"alcoholic\" but it describes how one can be somewhere on that spectrum for years. To add some words of caution though, as you mentioned, alcohol is a drug that changes the brain, and it didn't take much for me to go down that slippery slope. Also, you are right, AA isn't the only way to get sober, but it is free and provides a marvelous blueprint for living that could benefit anyone. But there are many good options. I, too, am so grateful to wake up ever morning having been sober for another 24 hours. The best part is being rid of guilt and shame and knowing it is  okay to be just \"me\".",

Unable to submit to this mental artifact, while remaining true to oneself, prevents many people from participating.  Fortunately, courts   now have  other edifying counseling choices that offer  different approaches to sobriety.  There is nothing worse than watching a loved one destroy him/herself with alcohol or any other drug.  It is exhausting, indeed. \n\nIf \"God\" is in place, then, \"go for it\"; go too AA.  The camaraderie  that emerges among group members may be the key to address the illness.  Try whatever works.  It is worthwhile.",

But according to recent medical research, the disadvantages outweigh the health benefits. The National Cancer Institute has reported many times that there is no safe level of drinking in relation to the risk of various forms of cancer. The benefit of drinking on heart health is still being debated. Binge drinking is shown to thin out the brain gray matter (which can be reversed by stopping). Abstemious religious cultures such as Seventh Day Adventists and Latter-Day Saints live longer than anyone else. Furthermore, alcohol consumption adds to weight gain and subtracts from your bank balance. I am fed up also with the memory lapses and waking up with a dry mouth.\n\nAfter consumption, ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde, which is bad for your body. You might as well pour gasoline into your body.\n\nAs noted by the writer, a wonderful substitution is seltzer. It is exciting and non-caloric. I find it mood elevating.",

Luckily for me, it's been a snap. I haven't touched a drop. Sure, there have been those moments (summer barbecues, the holidays, dinners out, etc) where I get a pang, but nothing too bad. I still like to mind-bend every now and then with a little weed -- a much less dangerous drug than alcohol. I feel better, sleep better, have fewer headaches.

Didn't read it, but kept it, still have it, with  a growing sense of awareness of alcohol's toxicity and ability to take hold of anyone even if it didn't taste that great. It was just a habit. And there are links to several types cancer for both men and women. and our society seems totally afraid of addressing  the toxicity aspect of alcohol. Although younger generations are said to be drinking less, there's always some alcoholic component, hard cider, even kombucha, craft beers. New resstaurants that pair  craft cocktails with food, etc.  Giving up was very hard, as wine especially was an old friend, but after some time you won't think about it.  It's not a cure-all for all of  life's woes and worries,  but giving up is  the only way  to inner wisdom, sleep, clarity and more. I would say forget the Dry Januarys or periodic tests.

I quit drinking 2 1/2 years ago, and have experienced everything that you mentioned for us now non-drinkers. The one thing that I would add that makes giving up drinking very hard, even years later, is the prevalence of drinking everywhere in our culture and in our media. You cannot watch a movie or TV show or commercial without seeing people enjoying alcohol. The same is true with going out to dinner with friends.  When one is exposed to all of these positive images of consuming alcohol and the fun it creates, it instills such a feeling of loss associated with not drinking. But, I find it useful to all remind myself of all the positives (and there are a lot of them) with being a non-drinker.

After her mother, also a chain smoking alcoholic, died, my mom got serious about her drinking; she survived on three packs of cigarettes, a pint of vodka and half a BLT a day for the next 30 years, until  a year before she dropped dead of a heart attack at age 70. Her blackouts eventually cost her most of her friends. She had to stop drinking when the cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy got too advanced. At that point I asked her about all her vicious and hurtful behavior. That's the thing with blackouts, she didn't remember any of it. The whole thing is just sad. A tragedy really.  My mom was a smart, capable, educated person who liked people and made friends easily. Alcoholism tears through lives indiscriminately, like a wrecking ball.",

It's an addictive substance, meaning it changes your brain to accommodate its presence in your life. The pleasure of ordinary events is diminished by the alcohol-dependent brain in order to cue you to include a drink. \n\nThe commercial success of an addictive product is no surprise. It's ubiquitous in popular media, songs, stories, videos, not to mention advertising. \n\nOur culture won't change unless we think this through and make a decision to reduce the wow-factor that lures young drinkers to step into the fray. We've done it with tobacco, to some extent. It's not impossible to imagine a comprehensive health warning for consumption of any amount for anyone, of either sex, at any age.",

Sure I had the same obvious physical benefits of no hangovers and significant weight loss.  But AA has allowed me rewire my brain, be alert to triggers that could cause relapse and has generally made me a better listener and a more empathetic person.  That's how it works for me and I acknowledge it's not a program for everyone.

It can kill by impairment, through a myriad of situations. \n\nA really insidious form of alcoholism is Functional Alcoholism. It's very common. A person 'keeps it together', maintaining work, family, and other responsibilities, but all sub par. Such a person often 'maintains' that way for decades. \n\nIn time the poison wins and serious health problems emerge. life circumstances erode and misery ensues that is shared by colleagues, friends and family.

At that time, I called an anonymous AA hotline after work(no internet yet!) and answered 7 of 10 questions (if I recall  correctly), \u201cYes.\u201d  I never looked back.  Once my pride and self rationalization was broken down, I knew being sober was the only choice for me. The decision saved my marriage and probably my career,  due to the corrosive and insidious effects of long term alcohol dependency. I also wanted to say \u201cno more\u201d to a deep family history of alcohol abuse.  \nMy wife of 41 years still enjoys a glass of wine occasionally, and I enjoy serving nice wine to our guests, but, \u201calcohol and me\u201d is not a healthy combination. The wistfulness for a glass of wine or a beer diminishes with time.  Before I retired, I ate out frequently and attended many industry conventions, seeing my peers say or do the most regretful, foolish things after too much to drink. I made my share of mistakes, but always enjoyed waking up clear headed the next morning.  \nBeing sober is a gift to those of us for whom alcohol is a siren all to self destruction.  Be thankful each day for that gift and never look back!",

Many in the US would welcome a more flexible political arrangement in which conservative rural areas were no longer able to impose their conservative values and reactionary economic policies on urban areas that produce most of the nation's wealth and creativity. In the US, this may require states and cities taking steps to weaken the federal government.  The federal government is no longer capable of addressing the nation's most urgent problems due to the disproportionate political power ceded to rural areas by our outmoded Constitution, which is now virtually impossible to change.  People cling to the hope that a progressive President will bring needed change, but this seems unlikely due to the ability of our senate to block reforms.

But in the case of...Brexit...we set the hare running that led to Donald Trump's extraordinary victory...He is seen to be on the side of ordinary American citizens and against the elites...I fully anticipate four more years of the Trump administration, and I will continue to be his biggest cheerleader on this side of the Atlantic...As [the World Economic Forum] champion diversity in everything but thought, this annual gathering belongs firmly in the past eras.\"\n\nLet's sum Farage's words up:  England should follow America's practices in business.  Trump's extraordinary victory has produced a leader fighting against the \"elite\" and for the ordinary American.  Diversity is bad.\n\nNeither Farage nor Bittner seem to have a good understanding of what's really happening in the world.  Bitter defends a desire of countries to only partially participate in the union they want to join -- kind of sounds like take the aid money and run.  \n\nAs for culture?  It's not clear what Farage means beyond immigrants are bad.  95% of American culture is based on the traditions of the immigrants - we killed the Natives before we could learn theirs.\n\nFarage and Trump are the problem, not the solution.

This has little to do with the EU. \n\nMore to the point, an EU \u00e0 la carte is a bad idea. It's a recipe for freeloading (e.g. opting out of military integration) and cherry picking.

The problem with the Euro as a currency is that it lacks by design the ability to be flexible in down times, and especially when the down hits some regions harder than others. An example is the downturn that caused Germans to pull out of vacation home purchases in Spain, and left Spain with a sudden banking and real estate problem that had to be paid in Euros, yet Germany resolutely refused to help fix the problem Germans had left in Spain; Spain did not have a debt problem until that happened.\n\nAnother is the issue of neo-liberal economics. In France they called it the American system, when Sarkozy tried to push it. Some won't, some can't. Some small nations just did it and let the weaker members of their population move abroad, as for example Latvia. Who is going to tell the Danes they are wrong about their economics, or the Eastern Europeans that they must fail because they have inferior economies?\n\nThen there is bureaucracy vs democracy. It means different things in different countries. France has a centralized system that is simply unacceptable in some other countries. What seems normal to France seems undemocratic to others.\n\nThen there are values. The religious wars were settled by separating these sovereignties. Just jamming them back together ignores what were real problems of values and basic assumptions.",

The situation worsened as former communist countries joined it, mainly to get free money but with almost no intention to accept western democracy and open society. \nIf UK proved more successful in near future, say 10-15 yrs from now, increasingly more people in many EU member countries would start demanding leaving EU. That pressure is expected to be more in more prosperous and relatively well governed Western European and Scandinavian nations.",

The same goes for Poland, Hungary etc. for the EU.\n\nGiving these folk more leeway might lead to more of the bad, rather than a relaxation of tensions.\n\nThe US might be going down a continuing hole of disintegration and negativity. But a defeat of Trump, some good Democratic policies,  and a chastised Republican Party might enable our political system to right itself.

And, oh yes, and let those countries that want to leave the euro currency zone do so without threats of economic blackmail. But I would up Mr. Bittner one on his hand of the so-called \"four freedoms.\" These should be reduced to three: goods, services, and capital. The last of these four \"freedoms,\" open-ended migration within the EU, was one of the main causes of the pro-Brexit vote (the British working class getting sick of having their wages undercut by Eastern European migrants). Freedom of movement needs to be dumped and replaced with some sort of managed migrations system put in its place. A much less grand, but much more sensible and flexible scheme.",

It sounded good to integrate and develop fledgling capitalist democracies, but led to disastrous economic projects like the Euro and then impotent social engineering for post-communist nations that had authoritarian legacies.  As as a confederation that lacked enforcement powers, it fell to the strongest members (like Germany) to impose solutions like \"austerity\".\n\nNow, as Europe faces new economic and political crises, the EU has become a populist whipping boy.

The Swiss solved that problem by pushing decision-making down to the lowest elected body that can deal with the issue.  If an issue can't be handled appropriately, then it is pushed to the next highest level, and so on.\n.\nSecond, the EU is unable to take hard decisions concerning critical interests in foreign policy.  Foreign actors find it far too easy to split members of the block from each other, and to cause them to fight amongst themselves.\n.\nThird, sometimes it takes military force to defend the EU's foreign policy interests. For example, right now the EU is losing a war on its doorstep in Libya that democracy really needs to win.  Given the size of the EU economy compared to its rivals, it should be an easy task.

If a country chooses to be part of the single market but not to asylum policy, there will be ultimately a conflict because single market means free movement of people. As for the military option, there is already an alternative to states that wish for security but not integration. It is NATO. Actually, it is the UK that blocked every attempt for military integration because they saw it as a step to far that would run contrary to the interests of NATO. Most importantly, the issues that Europe faces can often only be solved if all member states apply the solutions which often imply more integration. A Europe \"\u00e0 la carte\" might very well become a Europe that is financing authoritarian regimes to the detriment of the democracies. The thing is that politicians such as Orban will always say that Europe is the source of all issues in their home countries so that they have an excuse for everything and that they can consolidate their power at home. A Europe \"\u00e0 la carte\" is juste giving \"carte blanche\" to authoritarian-leaning leaders and I do not believe it is the remedy to Europe's ailments.",

Free movement of persons is a fundamental pillar of the Community, its acceptance non-negotiable.\n\nAn \u2018\u00e0 la carte\u2019 Union is a terrible idea and impracticable.

The nations that want less Europe are essentially right-wing, aspiring autocratic nations.\nOn the other hand, the EU is inflexible on the 4 freedoms. This is why the UK wanted out. They are happy with freedom of trade but not freedom of movement, forgetting for a moment how many of their own citizen have emigrated to France, Spain or Italy. The UK does not want Polish plumbers to settle in the UK, forgetting for a moment how many doctors and nurses they didn't have to pay the education for thanks to the rest of the EU.  \nOne of the key tenets of EU membership is the commitment to democracy. Viktor Orban, the leader of Hungary, hates Europe because it does not let him do what he wants. If it were up to him he would close borders and run the country like Albania. Perfect for him, terrible for the average Hungarian. The EU is not in the business of abiding by the whims of local autocrats. \nThe EU tried being flexible before. The UK did not sign on to the single currency or to the Schengen treaty, and they got a special agricultural deal. They still got out.\n\nThis evidently does not work.

Is the US going to open the door to Britain's one real success story, financial services, in detriment to its own? I have my doubts. It is notable that talk of 'Frexit', 'Grexit' etc. has diminished considerably across the continent as the political horror show of Brexit has unfolded in Westminster and that's before the real negotiations for a trade deal have started; a trade deal that the Brits want to complete in a record 12 months.

Donald Trump, he has to sit down to his therapist and discuss what he's done wrong but lie to the American people on his station.\nAt the trial of Jesus , Pontius Pilate he asked his fellow Republicans who do you want to save Bruno's or Jesus Christ our Lord. And everybody in the crowd put their thumbs down with our Lord Jesus Christ who paid the ultimate price for our lives with his blood. After a year Jerusalem was no more was destroyed by the Romans.\nThe Republican Congress on Friday sold American Constitution for 40 pieces of silver. As Benjamin Franklin said we are now a monarchy so all the Republicans live with it the stain on Friday will take years to recover.\nOn Sunday as you watch the Super Bowl think about the Patriots that fought for our freedom and love of our country we will all recover from the Republican blasphemy.",

Few people tune in to the pregame show. Those who wander over not knowing what time the Super Bowl actually starts will see his self-aggrandizement unleashed and Hannity sucking up to him. Only the \"true believers\" who never think they're wrong will enjoy the interview. Polls show supermajorities don't trust Trump, don't believe what he says and are embarrassed by him. Many would only vote for him if there is no other candidate who mixes economic populism with a more moderate cultural stance. As far as the game, I'm excited. There's a whole new approach to sports that is making games much more interesting. Calling a variety of plays (like LSU did), taking an evolutionary approach to competition and of course the great talent on display will be the real draw, not a vain and corrupt politician. The American people are by and large tired of politicians like Trump, except for those who are brainwashed.",

Alan Dershowitz made this outrageously clear last when he retooled the famous Nixon defence [my paraphrase]: \"If the president thinks he is perfect, well, then he must be perfect!\"\n\nThe simplicity is ... shattering. It is almost divine. The first-ever witness-less and evidence-less trial in American history has stunned our rational sensibilities and left voters feeling more spiritually enfranchised than of mind and body. Our death of Liberty feels close as we reach for anything of legal shape, sense, and value.\n\nThe GOP senate, like a weird kind of cult, has left reason, worldly practicalities, and the Constitution at the door. We are forced to abandon our minds as we surrender ourselves to the insane logic that not only did the president get away with a crime, the crime has, in a kind of perverse tautology, exculpated itself and is therefore no longer a crime. And this, citizens, is the true Trumpian cult miracle we have all witnessed this week.\n\nSo come one, come all to the Trump tent where Pastor Hannity probes the one true source of everything that is great or will ever be great about America: Our Perfect UnImpeachable Leader, Donald John Trump!\n\nAlso, Go Giants.",

I would question only one thing Mr. Leitch did wrong, and it happened twice, both times in connection with football players kneeling in protest before a game - the first, when they were doing it, and the second, when the League forbade them to do it. A rule of journalism is that you always assume a certain lack of knowledge on the part of your readership when writing about current events. In this case, both times Mr. Leitch mentioned the kneeling, it was without the explanation that the act was taking place DURING the playing of our National Anthem. Reading it, one might assume that the jocks just decided to kneel down for a minute or two, maybe to tie a shoelace or scratch their ankles. Absence of pertinent facts (no matter how many readers already know those facts) can also be considered a form of fake news, or at least of imbalanced reporting.",

When a president uses the power of the office in ways that threaten national security then it is an actual high crime.  The Russian effort to take over Ukraine has been strengthened by trump in his weakening of the allegiance with the USA.  It may be that this was all Putin's idea in the first place, passed to trump in a secret meeting. In fact it may be that trump's reason for providing additional funds in 2018,19 was to create more dependence on him in 2020.  If Russia is successful in overtaking Ukraine then that is one more step toward Putin's stated goal to reestablish Russia as a world power.  The republican senators are protecting the many other complicit actors in the know: Pence, Barr, Pompeo at the top.",

Implementing a federal jobs guarantee requires making millions of useless fake jobs that will, in effect, make employees jump through hoops so that they're not just given their wages. \n\nInstead, cut out the fat, the inefficiency and implement Yang's UBI.\n\nYang is the only candidate who is focused on solutions and what's looming in the very near horizon. His depictions of the increasing role of A.I. are not doomsday scenarios. \n\nTo all you Bernie supporters, I pose this question. What good does a $15 or $20 or even a $30 federal minimum wage do for all those who've already and are continuing to lose jobs because of the shrining retail sector?\n\nTaxing robots may slow down technology for a short while, but legislation can't hold back the wheel of the march of technology.\n\nDon't fear the UBI simply b/c it has received libertarian support in the past. It's an elegant solution. The article is the first decent one on Yang from the NYTimes. \n\nThe Editorial Board that endorsed Warren/Klobuchar then suggested that Yang run for City Council in NYC was cringeworthy. and very disrespectful. Here Yang has outperformed Senators and Governors, and a Times reporter tells him to give up and run for NYC City Council. Would they have had such audacity to put forth same advice to Corey Booker? or Kamala Harris? \n\nShameful.",

Some people who get social security don't need any extra.  Those for whom ss is their only income source are in trouble.  Those who earned less, say minimum wage, get less social security.  Giving the $1000 per month to those who are over a certain income level in retirement wouldn't make sense.  However, for the elderly poor, it could supplement social security.  Remember that this is something they paid into all their lives, on a low income, and now are hurting because they have no other source of income.  Unlike people who are able to work, start their own businesses, etc to move beyond this level or to supplement it, many of the elderly don't have these options.  So, selectively, some people on social security should receive the extra money.  Their minimum wage jobs didn't provide a pension nor did they have the ability to invest in any 401Ks.\n\nWhen you see a senior citizen greeter at your Walmart, it is unlikely they are doing that job to \"get out more\" despite the hype.  They are probably doing it to supplement their social security.  And still paying into social security with every minimum wage paycheck.  And worrying what happens if they can no longer work.

The rest is nothing but warmed-over corporate establishment Democratic positions, which is why Yang appeals to the Times.\n\nSure some jobs were lost to automation but Yang seems to discount the fact that since Reagan many jobs were moved overseas by Republican business owners.   GOP tax cuts for the rich have only led to increased income inequality, I don't hear Yang talking about that either.\n\nWhile the measly $12K per year that Yang is proposing sounds good it is barely going to scratch the surface when it comes to addressing the rampant income inequality that exists here in the US.  But it seems enough to wealthy Dave Chappelle, who sits on piles of cash while his \"neighbors\" suffer.\n\nWhen it comes to economics Weiss is a lightweight, instead of the NY Times she should be writing articles in aimed at her fellow Millennials in Teen Vogue. That is not to say that she cannot learn more about economics but I doubt it given her penchant for lazily repeating so-called \"conventional wisdom\".\n\nLike her assertion that Bernie's appeal is due to \"class rage\".  I suggest Weiss do some research into social democracy before she embarrasses herself some more by repeating unsubstantiated and unsupported drivel as the truth.\n\n#NotMeUs",

UBI of course, but also ranked choice voting, abolishing the penny, and zoning reforms.\n\nAdditionally, he is truly how I imagined president's to be like when I was growing up. He is considerate, thoughtful, intelligent, and care about the well-being of all Americans, he brings out the Patriot in me and I truly believe that he can begin the process of tearing down the partisian divide that is eating our country.",

Even the typical complaint--repeated in this article--is a genuine strength: \"Bernie's been saying the same thing for decades.\" ...That's because he was right then and he's right now!\n\nSilicon Valley \"disrupters\" are not producing the changes we need, and without a strong democratic check on their behavior, companies like Facebook and Uber have become the new Standard Oil. Platform capitalism exploits workers and exposes consumers to abuses, while the companies themselves escape accountability. \n\nYang understands this, but he's too much of a libertarian to truly fix it. While the Freedom Dividend sounds bold, but it's no different from the cash for oil policies in places like Alaska. It's effectively a bribe: let corporations continue to exploit you, and we'll throw some cash your way each month.\n\nSocial Democracy can implement policies and regulations to meet these challenges. We begin by putting the worker first at all levels of political and economic decision-making. We must write the rules of the economic game with the worker's right to a life of dignity at the center. \n\nThe philosophical defect in Yang's approach is that he starts with big business, and then attempts to accommodate the people.

He appears to be the only one with an eye on the future, and I his vision of harnessing the power of automation so that it improves the lives of all Americans, not just the handful few who own the \"robots\" and prosper while the rest of us descend into a dystopian hellhole. \n\nYang's message resonates with me, and I know that I am not alone. It is so readily apparent that he is Trump's kryptonite and that if the Democrats get behind him, the general election will be a cakewalk. I mean, Trump himself literally said, \"the only thing I worry about is some total unknown that nobody ever heard of.\" There's a reason he is the only candidate Trump has not insulted.\n\nI predict Yang leaves Iowa with at least one delegate, shocking the establishment.

Regarding 2016, to dismiss Russian interference, etc. and the fact that the electoral college enabled a candidate to become President despite nearly three million Americans voting for his opponent is NOT good math. Yes, she should have campaigned more in the rust belt states. To me the truth is that Bernie's and Warren's ideas are far from radical.

This is happening with visible robots as well as algorithms or marketing and sales automation. Very few jobs aren\u2019t at risk of being automated. It isn\u2019t just low paid work- it is just showing up there first because there are more low paid workers. Google if you don\u2019t believe me. \n\nThe only economic proposal that has been put forward for years to address this (Yang got the idea from here) is some form of UBI so that al the humans benefit from the work of the robots. Yang is just a champion for the idea because he cares. And that seems genuine.\n\nAs it stands now, companies are automating away because their job is to stay competitive - robots are cheaper and more reliable. They don\u2019t need to feel good, or inspired to do work. Humans are being left out and will become increasingly dependent on already stressed government programs while businesses are flush with cash to pay a small number of people to run them. What a recipe for disaster. \n\nUBI may not be perfect, but it isn\u2019t like we won\u2019t have to spend the money anyway just to deal with the shanty towns created by climate change and automation.",

Many of these people responded to the Trump message and symbols of racism (but they didn't think of themselves as racists) and his solution of a strong man taking charge over the broken institutions, not to fix them, but to smash them.  The authoritarian-style offered by Trump gave them hope that somebody would by-pass the \"do-nothing Congress\", \"drain the swamp\",  withdraw our money and soldiers from foreign countries after generations of wars, occupations, and support of overseas military installations that seemed to not benefit ordinary Americans. Yang offers a counter-solution of to nativist populism.  His populists are more diverse, believe in the value of education, science and facts.  They are less likely to believe in \"fate\" or have closed religious views of the world.  They like Yang as a disruptor who is not anti-science nor racist.  This is promising to me but I worry he may not have the political skills to be President. I hope whoever wins will put Yang in a VP or give him a major cabinet post .",

It played a part, but overall it was globalization, a political environment that became increasingly hostile to organized labor, and lax enforcement of labor laws, including the employment of illegal immigrants.  But I can see why he thinks it's more productive to focus on the current and future threat, instead of dwelling on a past that can't be changed.  All those things I listed are why the good jobs went away.  Automation is the reason they will never return.  It's also the reason those jobs that can only be done by someone physically present in the U.S. will never pay as much as the lost jobs did.  Workers have no leverage.",

And, at the same time, I like just about every policy idea Yang puts forth. I have nothing negative to say about him. But, your inference throughout this piece that Yang... and solely Yang ... is putting forth game-changing ideas regarding American society and its economy is simply wrong.\nDo you not recall what Sanders did in 2016? The ideas he brought to the table? The people he brought into the political process? The upending of the status quo? For god's sake, he had NPR journalists Mara Liasson and Tamara Kieth taking potshots against him and then completely ignoring him when his campaign became a threat to HRC. Then there was jeff Bezos' new plaything , the Washington Post, ripping him almost weekly with a hit piece .\nI'll go as far to say that Sanders 2016 is what made a Yang candidacy even have a shred of plausibility. I feel like I want to say that Sanders and Yang uniquely share the attribute of authenticity rarely seen in politicians. Perhaps generationally different kinds of authenticity. I'm hoping that's Yang's draw, because that should mean they'll migrate back to Bernie and not flock to \"Mayor\" Pete.",

The two principles components of his plan are time tested. A value-added tax (VAT) has been used with success in Europe for years. It\u2019s more or less a known quantity. The mechanism for distributed payments has also been used with success for years in a variety of places. It\u2019s even been used here in America. For example, in Alaska.\n\nOn the flip side, what has been shown not to work for economic redistribution is a wealth tax. It\u2019s not that the idea is inherently bad, but it\u2019s costly and difficult, if not impossible, to implement effectively. The chief problem being, how does one quantify wealth when there are so many ways to hide it or when the market value of assets are hard to ascertain? This is a bigger problem than it might seem at first and it\u2019s why many countries that have tried a wealth tax like those being proposed have ultimately abandoned it.\n\nHarvard economist Greg Mankiw has endorsed the essence of Yang\u2019s UBI plan for these above reasons. It\u2019s past time to start considering it as the viable economic redistribution mechanism that it is.\n\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it, start looking into it yourself. You might just come away with a changed view. I know I did.",

I certainly don't want to lower the voting age. In other words, I think he's wrong about a number of things.\n\nBut, as P.J. O'Rourke said when he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, he's \"wrong within normal parameters.\" It's much more important now to have a smart, decent person in the White House than to have one who punches every box on my philosophical sandwich card.\n\nSo take note, Democratic voters: This right-leaning, anti-Trump, swing-state independent will leave the presidential line on the ballot empty if Warren or Sanders is on it.

Efficient, relentless, and expanding in quantum leaps, both displace workers who cannot compete and at far less cost as the expenses are amortized.  Yang understands the impact on the lives of the displaced workers and ultimately of businesses that cannot afford or distrust to invest.  \n\nPondering policies to implement in the face of a national and global emergency is not a terrific campaign strategy but people understand their own jobs could be next and then what? \n\nSo count this aging boomer in as a member of the gang.

C'mom DNC, recruit them all to keep on speaking so that their supporters can understand that while they differ on many policies, their basic philosophies align. Allot some money for that.

Americans pay, per capita, twice as much as the three dozen countries that have higher qualities of health care, per capita.  The reason is that health care in these better functioning systems is seen as a service to be done efficiently.  In the US health care is a commodity to be sold to the highest bidder.  It's a case of charging what the market can bear.  If Americans pay twice as much for a second rate system; couldn't they get at the very least a higher level of health care for the same amount?  The money's there, being forked out every month, trillions a year.  What it will cost should be less than now.  The down side is that a million irritating parasitical people will be out of work.  That's why Obama couldn't make the full switch.  Unemployment was over 9%.  Now, at less than 4%, America can absorb the layoffs and make the change.  Then there are the billions of dollars paid to the politicians by the health care industry.  These realities need to be pounded into the public conscience repeatedly.

In the US it's just suggested that that's what its politicians should do in its constitution. There further progressive taxation to promote the general welfare is controversial. It's \"sticking it to billionaires\". It's \"class rage\".\n\nIt didn't always used to be this way, but for decades now in the US, democracy has meant attracting the votes of people by appealing to their particular identity when campaigning, relating to their particular hurt and prejudices, then when elected declining to provide for them through government such things as you enjoy and take for granted, like universal healthcare and paid parental leave - but for all other Americans too. Real nice and \"democratic\" - see?\n\nAndrew Yang's style represents a refreshing change from this. It's authentic democracy - I mean  \"populism\" - but \"healthy populism\" because he's planning to give every American $1000 dollars per month regardless of their particular identity - even billionaires - without \"sticking it to billionaires\". God only knows how he expects to pay for it. That's not important. What's important is that he's optimistic. He conveys hope.",

As an octogenarian who has never missed an election, and one who decries with disgust all that Trump has proved to be, I'm afraid he may not be defeated by some  Democrats for whom the country may not be ready.

I'm not fond of commenting on politicians' communicative powers - we should focus on issues - but Yang does have a gift with engaging people.  And honestly, if he's conning us, he has me fooled.  \n\nYang isn't the anti-Sanders, and he's not a spoiler candidate to pin conservative hopes on.  I think if he was running as the sole outsider challenger to Biden, as Obama did to Hillary, he'd likely prevail.  In such a crowded field, who knows?\n\nThe best reasons to consider Yang that I've heard are:  1.  His genuine appeal across party lines and 2.  His supporters argue his U.B.I. could actually get passed, even with a Republican Senate.  And while U.B.I. wouldn't solve anything completely, it could help everything.  \n\nI'm waiting to see what happens in Iowa.  Sanders, Warren, and Yang all have my attention.

The truth is that automation and the gig economy are decreasing the number of people needed to do a job and decreasing the pay of those who are still needed. Good paying jobs are now requiring people who can move further and further to the right of the skills bell curve, whether that is intelligence, salesmanship, artistic ability, sports, etc. That leaves more and more people at the left end of the curve to suffer with no or low paying jobs. As more automation and AI kicks in, this will only get worse. At some point we will have to change our economic system to recognize this. Yang sounds like he is already thinking in this way. As a result, he is probably the best candidate for 2020.",

Politics has always been the distorted shadow of economic reality, and the boundaries of economics have always been expanded by technological innovation. Yang says that we are in the 4th industrial revolution. I think he's right. However, it's not simply robots that we should be concerned about (R2D2 won't be delivering the mail anytime soon). Disintermediation is the source of the real problems caused by technological advancement. Technology is what allows humans to find the shortest route between labor and productivity. It could be a robot, or it could be an app that connects people who need a ride with drivers willing to provide the service. Or a massive conglomerate of retail suppliers connected with everyone's home address. Technology takes out the middleman. Things that once appeared inexorable, (taxi medallions, small town storefronts) become devalued towards a vanishing point. Yet, GDP keeps going up due to these increasing market efficiencies. It's easy to see the shocking number of job categories that are currently vulnerable to technological disintermediation; and it's hard to imagine what forms of human labor will eventually replace those lost jobs. UBI in the form of Yang's $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend is the economic breathing room our citizens need to figure out what the future holds. That future is coming at us too fast for capitalism to remain at a standstill.",

We've created an economy where the upper middle class are workaholics and the working class struggle to find decent work.

We can no longer cling to our archaic notions of a meritocracy; Walmart will continue to replace people with self-checkouts, Tesla will continue to develop autonomous vehicles, MGM will continue to replace its bartenders with novel robot cocktail shakers, and as these economic shifts keep occurring, more and more people will get left behind.\n\n$1000 a month isn\u2019t meant to be the perfect answer to all of our problems, but it is the easiest/most straight forward way to ease the tensions, anxieties & stress of the 78% of Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck. When nearly 50% of Americans can\u2019t afford an unexpected $500 bill, how can we expect people to be concerned about the macro issues of the world?\n\nWe need an economy that recognizes our human values, our stay at home parents, our volunteers, our care-givers, our artists; all of the things that bring our communities closer together. We need to find our way back to valuing the vibrancy/uniqueness of the individual.\n\nAndrew Yang is anything but the ego that wants the limelight. He elevates everyone around him by genuinely caring about the well being of us all.",

As a well-educated, well off millennial who has benefitted tremendously from tech and innovation in this country, the economy has never felt like it's been rigged against me. However, I can tell you that I and many others like me know that something is not right with our economy and country. As Yang would summarize it, the system is rigged against normal people on all sides of the political spectrum. His ability to inspire people from everywhere to reflect on our humanity is why I'm voting for him this election cycle. I love Yang's policies, but I also love his politics and his humanity.",

His proposals for a Universal Basic Income, as well as \"Democracy Dollars,\" are probably two of the most important policies to be put on the table by any presidential candidate in many, many years, and could do wonders for our democracy. \n\nI truly think Yang is the best candidate to beat Trump as he is likely the only one who can garner significant support from both sides of the political aisle. He is the candidate who can actually mend the deep wounds of division in our country, and the data backs that up by showing his support from liberals, disaffected Trump voters, and independents alike. \n\nHe has my vote.",

I think Trump is a terrible president, but it's not motivating to know that what is happening in Washington are pointless battles going on in congress and in the media. \n\nWhen I heard Andrew speak for the first time, it was eye opening. He talked so clearly about the problems the country is facing and about his vision for the country. He doesn't blame Trump in his stump speech and instead calls him a symptom of a larger set of problems he hopes to solve.\n\nHis vision, his clarity, his focus on solving those problems are so bright, optimistic, and hopeful that you can't help but feel excited for it. \n\nI have felt that Donald Trump should not be president and that any democrat would be better. So I can understand the idea of voting for the candidate that can beat Trump. \n\nBut now I realize if you want to defeat Donald Trump at the ballot box, you have to pick the candidate that you would feel excited for regardless of Donald Trump. \n\nRight now the candidates are betting on Democrats feeling angry at Trump to come out and vote. If they are not angry, they will not turn out.\n\nIf you choose a candidate that you are excited for, a vision that excites you, you will turn out regardless of Trump. To beat Trump, you have to pick a candidate that excites Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Conservatives and Independents so much they forget about Donald Trump.\n\nAnd the best one to do that is Andrew Yang.",

It's cynical perhaps but I don't have any faith that Americans have that level of sacrifice in them whatsoever. No matter how we watch California burn or the babies behind bars, Americans treasure THY SELF above all else.

The fact is that despite many organizational disadvantages, Bernie performed well in quite a few states where Clinton lost narrowly, that he appeals to many working class voters who voted for Trump because they see the mainstream candidates signing up for the perpetuation of the hegemony of the Ivy League classes. Since then he has developed strong support among African Americans under 40, leading the field. In truth, Sanders is no radical. He is far more New Deal Democrat than Bolshevik. He is a consistent supporter of reasonable redistributive measures with a long, successful history in Western Europe. It's been over a hundred years since Teddy Roosevelt broke up the trusts and 88 years since FDR built the foundations of the modern United States. Our infrastructure is falling apart. Inequality has grown sharply since 1980. Our social contract is failing. Tens of millions lack health insurance. We need a difference maker in the White House. Bernie Sanders is that man. Every New York Times attack on him further confirms that the paper's supposed liberalism cloaks blanket opposition to any recalibration of the rules of a society tilted against the middle and working class.",

While it seems that you have not had to grapple with the struggles of living paycheck to paycheck, working multiple jobs and still struggling to pay bills, being unable to afford healthcare, etc., many of your fellow citizens have and they were so fed up with the moderate elites in control of the democratic party that they felt they were better off throwing their lot in with an unstable egomaniac. While He has utterly failed to drain the swamp and instead bowed to its rulers, if we again fail to endeavor to make this country one where the promises of life, liberty, and happiness are accessible to all, He will reign for four more years. Thus I urge you to find some obscure event in the far past and commit yourself to it so that it will keep your keyboard busy through November.

But it's not history.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Sanders' campaign and the latest in the Times' pattern of denunciation and disparaging of Sanders?  Nothing other than it is a pattern.",

Fox News, Facebook, Twitter erupt in a firestorm of debates, more like massacres, about the pros and cons of democractic socialism. Most Americans, of course, have no idea what democratic socialism actually means or how it differs from a social democracy. Democrats are at a loss as how to best respond to the onslaught of attacks from the right. Should they embrace and defend socialism or should they try to argue that Sanders is not actually a democratic socialist? \n\nSo everyone eagerly tunes into the first debate between Trump and Sanders hoping that Sanders' arguments will shed light on this question. Sure enough, the first question from the moderator to Bernie Sanders is: \n\n\"Mr. Sanders, you describe yourself as a democratic socialist. You have also made reference to some of the Scandinavian countries as providing good role models for the US. Yet, none of these countries, nor any other Western European countries, have socialist governments. Rather, they are social democracies, democratic, free-market economies just like the US. Could you please explain the differences between the social democrat policies of Western European countries and your own democratic socialist policy agenda? \n\nEnd of debate.",

For instance, in a November 2019, Hill-HarrisX poll, 48% of respondents said that they would vote for a democratic socialist for public office, while 52% said that they would not. Moreover, in an April 2019 Gallup poll, 47% of respondents said that they would vote for a generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be a socialist, while 51% said that they would not. So, it\u2019s not as if there were multiple excellent polls conducted within the last couple years in which 90% of US respondents said that they would not vote for a socialist or democratic socialist for public office, including president.\n\nThird, when people hear what Sanders means by \"democratic socialism\" and what policies he favors, most realize that they agree with many, most or all of his key policy ideas. What Sanders favors is basically Scandinavian social democracy. For instance, he does not think that the government should prohibit private ownership of the means of production in all circumstances.",

No Sanders is really more of a late model version of Franklin D Roosevelt, a man who came into the White House job as the bankers' friend, survived a planned coup by his Wall Street friends with the help of Marine war hero Gen. Smedley Butler, demanded their support on pain of facing treason charges, and began instituting socialist ideas like Social Security, unemployment insurance and laws legalizing unions to quiet the rising worker unrest. As the war was ending Roosevelt moved further left, seeing the trend in soon-to-be Post-war Europe, and at the start of his record-breaking fourth term proposed an Economic Bill of Rights that would guarantee everyone a well-remunerated job, government run health care, and a home. It was a bold plan, quickly forgotten by Cold Warrior Truman. Sanders wants to pick up where FDR would have gone had he not suffered a fatal stroke.  When he wins the Democratic presidential nomination this July, they Americans will cheer his plans, as well as his vow to end legal corporate bribing of politicians.

Labour squandered an enormous political capital by presenting the most unpalatable, divisive and controversial candidate they could find. His rival Boris Johnson, although scandal-ridden, derided as a buffoon, despised as a populist demagogue, a liar and a cheat, easily destroyed Corbyn and his neo-marxist political message.\n\nThe risk for the Democrats is clear: elect Sanders in the primaries, and end up with the most monumental defeat in decades - and four more years of an emboldened, out-of-control Trump.

You might think, \"But what about the Scandinavian countries?\" Well, those are NOT democratic socialist or any other kind of socialist countries.

The  same is true for virtually all of the other Western European countries, including Germany, France, and the US.\n\nI am at a loss WHY Bernie insists on the label \"democratic socialist.\" I have read at least two articles that argue, convincingly, that is actually NOT a democratic socialist, but rather a social democrat. He wants the US to be more like Finland or Denmark, not Venezuela or North Korea.\n\nUnless Bernie drops the label \"democratic socialist\", he will be toast in the general election. And I find it unlikely that he will do so, given his stubborn nature. \n\nIf you don't belive me, go and look up the difference between social democrat and democratic socialist yourself.

The article is an amazing rebuttal to the Democratic Centrist refrain of \u201cunelectable\u201d (Hillary being one of the strongest supporters of this viewpoint, from someone who actually proved to be unelectable). The only democratic candidate who has won in recent memory was Obama, who ran on a platform of change and hope, since destroyed by the Trumpian/McConnellian cabal who absolutely refuse compromise of any sort and demonize and denigrate all who disagree with them. This is the new political system of America, and the article in Vanity Faire does a great job of exploding antediluvian myths about the supposed electability of Sanders. The mainstream centrist Democrats who have been playing the accommodation game for decades to support the economic status quo of the Beltway and our country have finally been put into the Sanders spotlight...who is REALLY going to change politics in America?

A HUGE difference is that thru the FED the federal gov can create as much money as wants out of thin air. It does not need to borrow or tax to pay for gov operations. Unless you have a printing press in your basement, you cannot do this. \n\nFederal deficits & debts are nothing to worry about & in fact, are necessary. ALL 6 times we have eliminated deficits & paid down the debt 10% or more, we have fallen into a terrible real depression. Since prices are proportional to the amount of money in the economy (times its velocity), creating too much money could cause excessive inflation. BUT prices are also inversely proportional to the amount of goods and service we can produce. A bumper wheat crop LOWERS wheat prices. And that is what FDR's policies did. They increased production while getting more money to the people who needed it and would spend it. \n\nOf course, if the economy is constrained and you can't produce any more, this will not work. E.g., if you just lost a war, and you did not have enough arable land to grow food to feed your people, and had no money to buy food, and your people were starving, printing money is just going to result in billion mark stamps. \n\nBut that is certainly NOTHING like our situation today when production could be vastly increased if people only had more money to buy stuff, & new money comes from federal deficits.",

It can (thru the FED) create as much as it needs out of thin air. Just think about where money you pay your taxes with came from in the first place. Unless you have a printing press in your basement, it originally came from the federal gov. \n\nOf course, creating money has consequences, but that is entirely a different question. If the program greatly facilitates production, that will hold down prices since they are INVERSELY proportional to production. If we need to increase taxes at all, it may well be far less than the cost of the program. \n\nI don't know if Bernie understands this, but it seems he is perfectly willing to propose programs without worrying about taxes. In addition, he has advisors (e,g, Stephanie Kelton) who do understand how the federal gov works. I don't see any such advising the others. \n\nA reader from Boston called max neatly summed it up: \"So many of our economic issues could be solved if people understood that the US cannot run out of money, and how hard it is to cause hyperinflation from gov spending alone.\" \n\nThis is why I support Bernie Sanders.",

The big mistake the Dems keep making is trying to capture the elusive white voter, most recently the ones that voted for Obama and went to Trump, with centrist candidates, and that is not the right strategy. I think Bernie could capture more Trump voters who voted for Obama than any centrist could hope for, and bring along the under 45 vote and Latinos, many of whom are Sanders supporters. Then who\u2019s left? The moderate voters who can\u2019t stand Bernie or his supporters because some of them didn\u2019t vote for Hillary.

Three times, the party nominated William Jennings Bryan, the quirky progressive with great oratorical pipes, and three times they were trounced.\"\n\nFirst of all, different candidates, different times. Jennings ran over one hundred years ago (in 1896, 1900, and 1908). While there are some similarities, such as the screwing of the (in Jennings terminology) \"common man,\" the issues then are not the issues now. There was no concern for the deleterious effects of a for-profit healthcare system, no concern for the capitalistic destruction of the world environment and the resulting threat to the habitability of the planet. There was no gigantic student debt.\n\nWomen's issues were largely ignored. In fact, Jennings would have been more in line with Trump on such issues as abortion.\n\nThere is also one huge factor that makes Sanders' chances for success much greater than Jennings': Jennings didn't run against Donald Trump. Many, many people who at other times would have been reluctant to vote for Sanders,  including such stalwart capitalists as Mike Bloomberg, have stated that they will vote for WHOEVER is the Democratic nominee for president, even if that nominee is Sanders.",

Mr. Egan has staked out a position that, if it turns out to be how things unfold, makes him look great, insightful, prescient. If things break the other way and Sen. Sanders is elected, people will either forget what Egan has said in the past or he can deflect with a \"who woulda thought\" shrug. Weak tea from one the NYT's star columnists to mollify HIS fears.  Egan would do far better to endorse the candidate of his choice and defend that decision, rather than claiming some special insight into the electoral process that \"regular\" citizens somehow do not have in the guise of warning us of our impending doom.  \n\nI support Senator Sanders in the same way I supported President Obama. I like both men because I do not think that they are corruptible. I feel the same way about Senator Warren; less so about the other candidates. I have serious policy disagreements with all three just mentioned, but I believe that they cannot be bought, that they believe in democracy and its promise (unfulfilled) of equality under the law and within the economy, above all else.  \n\nIntegrity - write about that.  It might decide the election",

None of them ran on a Sanders-type platform. They were more like Amy Klobuchar (who is pretty progressive by the way, but knows what scares off moderates).\n\n  These new House Democrats are why Nancy Pelosi is Speaker, why Trump could be impeached, and why GOP legislative priorities have been blocked since the 2019 congress was sworn in.\n\n  I'm not talking AOC & \"the squad\".

Neither Egan, nor the rest of the corporate MSM, ever mentions the crucial, known fact that Sanders beat Trump handily in the Rust Belt exit polls in 2016. Trump won the region as a clear second-best to Sanders for the legitimately furious workers of the region, and he only won because he and his advisors shrewdly did all he could to play Sanders in his reality show campaign by pretending to be fighting for the mob against their \"elite\" billionaire oppressors. There's a reason so many unions are coming out now for Sanders. The Rust Belt manufacturers and their workers have not fared well under Trump. Sanders is a much stronger candidate for the Rust Belt than Biden, as we'll see if Biden is still around for the Rust Belt primaries and Sanders finishes him off.

There are good people to be found in every milieu, and it is enough to make this American smile in hindsight, once  labeled a 'Socialist' by her parent for playing with the janitor's children.\n\nA friend and Republican neighbor, Potter, enjoys going on about he is 'The Elite', cackling away in puerile mode, while asking if he should wear a top-hat when dropping this passenger off to visit her sibling.  The sibling is an academic genius, happiest when studying artifacts in the desert, and reminiscent of Senator Sanders on a cloudy day.\n\nTo get to Friday, neither Potter, a working-class man, nor my sibling or this commentator are likely to cast our vote for Bernie Sanders.  \n\nThere is a difference.  Potter will vote Republican regardless of 'The Liberal' nominee, while my sibling and I will vote for the above, as a matter of principle.\n\nIt is my belief that some Americans in the greater majority  are not able to connect with Mr. Sanders, a great mentor who appears ahead of his time.\n\nDisappointment will take place if we are foolish enough to elect Trump to a second term, an unprecedented president, coddled and pampered by his senators.  He is not exactly a class-act, and some of the populace is weary of being kept on alert by his explosive chest-thumping.\n\nOrwell, a democratic socialist, showed little interest in American politics, but he left the following words for All:  'Be Afraid'.",

Bernie is also a change candidate, albeit a far more genuine one who can challenge Trump at his own game.

Bernie wants to help the underprivileged people by shrinking inequality and preventing big money from buying political favors.

This is no longer the case for many people, because most wealthy parents pass on the wealth to their children. Our current system rewards even those who are less productive as long as their parents are wealthy. \n\nBernie is not a socialist.

He may just win the popular vote as Al and Hillary did- through huge victories in states where Trump couldn't triumph even if he were endorsed by the ghosts of Franklin Roosevelt and Eugene Debs.  In the Electoral College, however, it would clearly be a rout, and we'll be stuck with The Donald for another four years and with a right-wing Supreme Court for at least a generation.  I'll say it again: Joe Biden can win in Middle America and he'll give progressives four-fifths of what we want.  Trump, on the other hand, will take away four-fifths of what we now have.  Should we gamble that the enthusiasm Bernie engenders on the left will soon spread to encompass the Midwestern Democrats who put Trump in office in 2016?  I'd take that bet, along with the Detroit Lions in 2020, but only with more points than the folks in Vegas could possibly offer me.",

The former USSR used the moniker because it was popular among its people, and the West naturally used skillfully as propaganda by tying Socialism to the repression of totalitarianism.

Bottom line: The concept of socialism to those in the red states -- particularly those over the age of 50 -- is  toxic. Right or wrong, it doesn't matter; it's just not a winning platform. And that's all that matters in the coming election.  I'm a left of center Democrat who loathes Trump more than any politician in my lifetime, and I live for the day that he's out of office. But Sanders can't do it, and nominating him would be a recipe for disaster.",

Mr Egan was cagey enough not to make hard predictions.  Not exactly a profile in courage, but his 2016 opinion pieces exude a sympathetic openness  to Trump's MAGA base that contrasts sharply with his sledgehammer approach to Sanders and his supporters.\n\nEgan is claiming by indirect reference to carefully misworded polls on health care and so forth - the fracking issue didn't lose Pennsylvania for Clinton! - that his designated \"moderate\" Democrat voters either won't show up at the polls, because \"socialist Sanders\", or will switch to Trump.  \n\nAny Democrat won't do?  More evidence is required, Mr. Egan.\n\nIt shows that, beneath the fake-liberal veneer, most of the NYT's Op-Eders fall on the conservative side of the political spectrum.   Rather like Fox News in San Francisco.\n\nAbove all, conservatives don't understand the difference between electoral politics and building a political movement for the long run.  If you think the US political system is hopelessly rotten and dysfunctional beyond repair, then elections aren't going to change anything, including with a President Sanders in 2021.  Only political revolution will do that.\n\nMeanwhile it is recommended that Mr. Egan put down his heady goblet of conservative ideology, and take out an insurance policy for what he will write about...just in case...Sanders wins in November.",

This has the makings of a winning coalition.\n\nYes, it's different from the Obama coalition.  Sanders won't inspire urban people of color.  And it's different from the 2018 Dem coalition.  Sanders won't inspire educated suburban women.  But it's still the Democratic base PLUS something.  Dems need that PLUS something to win.",

The problem with Sanders' candidacy is that he has always run as the opposition, never as the leader.  It's much harder to lead, than it is to criticize.  Furthermore, his record of accomplishment is minor considering his tenure.  Vermont is a net Fed $$ donor state, as 40% comes in from Washington every year.  Vermont is more fiscally like red states i.e. Mississippi, than blue, like NY, NJ, or CA, who pay those bills.  That's not a sustainable model.  Bernie's programs are ill defined financially at time when many are doing well, even if it's only because of ephemeral tax cuts and massive deficit spending: debt.  There is no way to pay for all of Bernie's programs without really big tax increases on the middle class, those making $20K-120K.  If you want to be like Denmark, you will have to pay lots more in taxes, and the defense department would need to shrink by 70%.  Everyone says centrism is boring.  It maybe, but it also moves most of us forward, most of the time.  The fringe voter on the Left enabled BushII, and Trump, to become President, just as Perot enabled Clinton.  The Right learned from that lesson, and stuck together.  The Left has yet to do it.  If the Dems really want to beat Trump, Bloomberg, a self made billionaire who can crush him in brains, and campaign dollars is a also a good option.",

What you miss is that Sanders now fully embraces the Outrage Culture Left and its identity issues. Trump will bury him with it. \n\nAnyone who thinks Sanders can win a general election needs to get out more. Sanders central appeal has always been his economic Socialism. While I'd argue Sanders' economics are more popular in parts of America than Egan says, his now embracing the Outrage Culture and Cultural Revolution Left guarantees Trump will win.\n\nSanders' economic Socialism alone dooms him in Republican suburbs which led Democrats to retake the House in 2018. Republican women may have chosen to vote for centrist Democrats for the first time in their lives, but actually speak with them, as I have, and they'll tell you they despise Sanders' Socialism and will never vote for him even as they loathe Trump.\n\nTrump will run against Sanders everywhere on identity, meaning Sanders loses all the working class areas his supporters wrongly think he'll win as Identity always beats Economics with those working class voters. \n\nTrump will exploit anti-Semitism, racism, and Islamophobia, bombarding Americans with footage of Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and Ilhan Omar together, and say something like: \"Sanders is the head of the worldwide Judeo-Bolshevic conspiracy, and with MS-13, and Jihadists, is opening up America\u2019s borders in order to destroy you\".

Furthermore, many swing voters are more interested in a candidate who can convince them he'll be different from \"the establishment\" than they are in any specific policy platform. Bernie is the only candidate in the field who can credibly convince voters of that. This is why he polls best among people who voted for Trump in 2016 but may consider flipping this year. \n\nPeople talk a lot about policy proposals and voting records when asked why they support a candidate but in reality most people make decisions like this based on how a candidate makes them feel. Bernie may cause some to recoil in fear of an imagined Communist takeover (but we were never going to win those people over anyway) but to most people, he feels like a breath of fresh air. He'll beat Trump in 2020 for the same reason Trump beat Clinton in 2016. People are angry about how things are going and they want someone who can convincingly promise radical change.",

Newton (1642-1727) brought us to grips with the scientific method, which led us into the Industrial Age.  Individuals were taught how to achieve knowledge.\n\nBut even Newton dabbled with alchemy and wrote about prophecies in Daniel and Revelation.\n\nNow, science teaches us about global warming, which he ignore.  Meanwhile, macroeconomics teaches us that economic growth is everlasting, even though global warming will certainly bring that to an end.\n\nMacroeconomic models have limited or no predictive value.  The problem is that while the planets have no choice but to follow physical laws, humans rarely follows laws with any consistency.  Thus when Thomas Piketty writes a book on the virtues of the \"wealth tax\" we need to take it with a grain of salt.\n\nNobody really understands how we can be running trillion dollar deficits and keep the stock market soaring to new heights.  The Fed makes small changes to the Fed Funds rate and looks at the result.  Even the Fed would be afraid to make a huge immediate change.\n\nA wealth tax adds a huge perturbation to the economic system with a result nobody can predict.\n\nBetter to change slowly like say Mike Bloomberg.",

His campaign hopes to achieve these goals through political means - an empowered electorate and due process of law. \n\nHe wants a system that mirrors Norway, Sweden, France - they have specific industries that were nationalized for the public good, while still remaining firmly pro-business. There have been issues in those countries as a result, but overall, quality of life and opportunities for the average citizen is better than the US. \n\nA true Marxist would be calling for a complete takeover of all industries by the state through violent popular revolution, as the Soviets and Cubans did. Bernie does not idealize these societies, nor does AOC. All we progressives are asking for is a more just and equal society that gives Americans access to decency and comfort. Having state-funded healthcare, jobs programs, and a reformed tax system is not radical - it's necessary to ensure a sustainable future.\n\nThe status quo has only worked for those who are old, white, and wealthy.

Whoever replaces Trump, either in 2021 or 2025, is going to have a big mess to clean up. He's going to need to find a way to combat Russia's efforts (its very successful efforts) to pit one U.S. citizen against another. He's going to need to inspire the parties and houses of Congress to work together. He's going to need to rebuild many of our international relationships. In short, he's going to need to be a healer.

He is, however, calling to account corporate America and our government for a system that has resulted in 40% of Americans not having $400 in the bank for an unexpected emergency expense. The source of this data is not a left-wing think tank: it is the Federal Reserve. U.S. life expectancy fell for three straight years for the first time in over a century as a result of an epidemic of \"diseases and deaths of despair\" (Nick Kristof has written in these pages on this) including the opioid crisis, suicide and alcoholism (life expectancy increased last year). Employees of Walmart earning its  minimum wage earn well below the poverty line (at roughly $23,000 per year) if they are working full time. Half of Walmart employees work part time even though they desire to work full time and therefore are not eligible for benefits. Millions of Americans cannot find work that allows them to support themselves and their families because of the winner-take-all version of capitalism that has proliferated over the past several decades. As Marco Rubio (far from a Marxist) said in a speech at the National Defense University in December, what we need is a \"capitalism for the common good\" because the free market is agnostic as to whether millions of Americans live in misery working low-paying jobs or not.

Both pursued democratic, mixed-market economic policies far from the imaginary nightmare scenario Mr. Evans tries to conjure up.\n\nIn any advanced Western country other than the USA, Senator Sanders' policies would hardly raise an eyebrow, and they have mostly been implemented wholesale for nearly a century.\n\nAnd when asked about the individual elements in Sanders' proposals, it turns out an overwhelming majority of Americans support them, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nWhile an Op-Ed may not need to adhere stricly to other professional editorial standards, this should not give the NYT free reign to simply publish deceptive , uninformed rants like this rather than fact-based opinions and analyses.",

The lack of any insightful analysis of what Bernie is really offering and why his support is as high as it is, is truly disappointing.

Every poll which has pitted a Democrat against Trump for four years has shown that the ONLY person capable of beating Trump is - Bernie!  Why?  Because the majority of US voters are Independents. And a lot of those belong to a middle class which has steadily been losing ground for the last 30 years. Bernie is the only one who really gets that. That's why he supports getting rid of student debt, and is for free universities. He is looking at how the future NEEDS a revolution, despite those with vested interests, or there will be NO future at all. Which is also why people also like his position on Global Warming. \nSo  stop believing the journalists from the NY Times. Last time the NY Times was doing everything possible to make it LOOK like Bernie couldn't win!  This time round that is not only a dangerous game for the  Democrats, but for the country at large. Destroy Bernie's chances and Trump WILL quite likely win. Trump won partly because the NY Times helped sabotage Bernie.  Don't do it again. The stakes are too high!",

That means more gridlock and nothing getting done.  We have had way too much of that already.\n2.   His stance on Israel and the Palestinian Arabs offends me as a Zionist.  He sees everything as class struggle, colonialism, etc. including the problems in the middle east.  It's just not that simple.\n3.  As a feminist, I have grave doubts about where he stands on women's issues.\n4.  He seems like a demagogue, albeit a left wing one versus Trump's right wing.\n5.  He is far too quick to give away other people's money.  I am all for higher taxes for the very rich, but Bernie's idea of wealthy will hurt the middle and upper middle classes.\n6.  While I support an eventual move toward Medicare for All,  this cannot be done with the stroke of a pen or too quickly.  We should begin with a public option which allows us to iron out all the inevitable problems over a period of 3-5 years.\n7.  He screams far too much.  Bernie needs to learn when to scream and when to speak in regular tomes.  I cannot listen to him for 4 years.\n\nI would vote for him if I had too (i.e., if I lived in a swing state).

This policy, then is determined by political, and corporate interests, etc.  When you have over 70,000 pages of the IRS Tax Code, where fewer and fewer individuals, corporations, families, farmers, real estate holdings, pay no taxes, you won't have good policy, either domestic or foreign.

If you aren't paying taxes, like DT, Kushner, Ivana, Amazon, corporations, the rich, most of those at the lower end of the earning scale, then why should you get to vote?  Our tax code is legalized extortion to pacify the masses, by those in Congress who know what the corporations, farmers, rich, etc. want, and the others will feel good about.

In today's paper was the stump speech for the remaining candidates in which Bernie Sanders clearly stated how Medicare for All would be gradually developed over several years and how it would be financed.  And he clearly defined what Socialism is in terms of who it will help.  And it clearly addressed David Brook's concern in the paper today about building community, in this case among the Middle Class.  If you must regurgitate Republican ideas about what Bernie is talking about don't disguise this as your own ideas.

Sander's critique of class and the economic system is just that - a critique. He looks at the current system, and sees that it works for so very, very  few. And he concludes that that's wrong. It's hard to believe that you, Mr. Egan, believe that Sanders believes that somehow he's going to transform the U.S. into a socialist country. He's a realist. He knows he will have to make deals and compromises. So, starting with a contemporary (not that bugbear, Soviet) socialist ideal, once he's made deals and compromises, he's likely to end up somewhat left of what is erroneously called the center but is really pretty much right-center.  If he starts in the center, or even mildly left-of-center, where does he end up? On the right. Really, which is the better starting point?",

The rich complain constantly about government while at the same time benefiting disproportionately from it: low capital gains taxes, low minimum wages for their employees, lax regulations for the pollution their companies cause.  \"Moderate\" Democratic presidents have done little or nothing to address these ever-growing disparities in our society, and often had helped exacerbate them (think of Clinton pushing through NAFTA which the Republicans favored rather than pushing for a health care deal first, or of Obama failing to push the Employee Free Choice Act over the finish line after he promised to do so).

They will light up that big with the half billion they have already stashed away in political donations.    \n\nBut I feel he is not the man, or the woman, for the moment.  The hatred he has for the wealthy, his wealth tax and other policies to pile on the rich, will spur on more division and a continuing and escalating battle for power that we all are greatly tired of.\n\nNot to mention his yelling, which drives me crazy.  I can't imagine that wearing on the nation much longer than a few months.\n\nFar better in my eyes would be a Biden/Stacy Abrams ticket announced at the Democratic convention, as well as a pledge to serve only one term, and including several cabinet appointments:  Secretaries of State, Susan Rice; Defense, Pete Buttigieg; Commerce, Andrew Yang; Treasury, Elizabeth Warren; AG, Kamala Harris/Corey Booker; Homeland Security, Julian Castro, HUD; Raul Castro.\n\nThese nominations, or others as Biden and his advisors decide, would join together in a crusade to return the country to normalcy and decency.   A Democratic team representing several constituencies would bring back the big tent coalition that elected Obama twice.\n\nThat, I feel, would be a good beginning of hopefully the last effort needed to reproach and defeat Trump and his Republican enablers once and for all.",

Two thoughts=he wont take the Democratic party down as a whole and the democrats can run as the adult party responding to needs for infrastructure, health care and education and immigration (especially DACA).  And keep asking how many of Trump's promises he made have been kept==Mexico Isn't paying for the Wall, where is that beautiful healthcare he promised, where is all the jobs for the miners, where is the infrastructure, how he doing on his GDP forecasts from his tax cuts, etc\n\nI would also like to add another candidate to your drop list== Elizabeth Warren; medicare for all and erasing student loan debt are not believable.....free dont cut it..Sorry",

Sanders is not grumpy, although MSM writers love to call him that. He is, in fact, very congenial.\nThird, you assume he is unelectable. Quite the opposite is true.

For Christsake our military is socialist military and it's the most powerful in the world. Our socialist police force and fire departments. We've adopted socialistic policies at different times and they're extremely popular like social security and medicare. This author is so trapped by his worldview he can't see the obvious contradictions to his analysis. Socialism is so baked into American society that at times people like this author don't even realize or ignore that it's there.",

Is that what universal healthcare, tuition assistance, green deal, and wealth taxation means to you, Egan? Bernie Sanders is running on an agenda highly compatible with the Democratic party of Roosevelt, and modern day European social democrats. In the past forty years, the wealth of the wealthy has quadrupled due to an extreme reduction in taxation of high incomes. The country's middle class and its infrastructure are in decline as a result. A re-balance is overdue. This is not class warfare. When I talk to Trump supporters, the only Democratic candidate they ever praise - is Bernie. I would say, Bernie is the candidate Trump will have the greatest difficulty attacking, and the only one who can match him in inspiring passion. If Bernie had won the primary in 2016, Trump would never have been president.",

A debate could be more of a repeated monologue on Sanders part though. I could just hear him echoing Ronald Reagan every time Trump lies, as Reagan did so well in his debate with Jimmy Carter, \"there you go again...\" A strategy should likely be used by whomever the eventual nominee is.  Trump's never been consistently called out for his perpetual lies, that's part of his (and by extension, our) problem.\n\nBy running such a populated field, the Democrats have made the selection process more difficult.

Do you think folks haven't noticed that its the privileged few that go to the best college and get the best jobs and only the most exceptional and fortunate of the rest can elbow their way in? It's not 1972 and it's certainly not 1908. Nobody expects a revolution -- until it happens. I grew up in Central Pennsylvania. If our criterion for picking a president is to please that small sliver of the electorate, the democratic party is just as lost as the republican one.",

That isn't what Sanders is advocating for, and this hasn't been implemented on a large scale in any country since Leninist Russia. This style of economics failed horribly, but isn't what Sanders represents.\n\nIf you are meaning social democratic policies then you are engaging in historical revisionism. Until Reagan, we had an ultra-progressive tax system where, in some years, the highest marginal tax rate was 90%. The minimum wage was the equivalent of  just under $20/hr when adjusting for inflation. The Republicans of the day would be at least, center left today on economic issues. Richard Nixon almost passed a minimum basic income (essentially UBI that Yang talks about) of $10,000 a year. \n\nWe saw the greatest expansion of social welfare programs from the 1930s until the 1970s and then their repeal in the 80s. So yes, policies like this have been implemented in the US before. Yes, the American public was once very friendly to this style of economics. The pendulum swung to the right to neoliberal economics in the 80s with Reagan. Now, the discourse has swung left again.",

Same for Elizabeth Warren. Despite some grumbles from the right about free college, taxing the wealthy (not so much grumbling as might be expected, though), immigration (open borders!), Green New Deal, and other initiatives, M4A will be the policy that gives trump the biggest chance to squeak another one by any otherwise Democratic shoe-in opponent.\n\nThere are Big Ideas a Presidential candidate can run on and, if not win based on them, at least not turn off too many voters who just can't bring themselves to support such bigness.\n\nThere are other Big Ideas that can only happen from an elected President that proves capable and popular, and thus earns enough cachet to drag the country with her or him - with some kicking and screaming - into bigness. FDR's New Deal, I think, came about that way: I haven't researched what his campaign platform was before he was elected. I don't remember Obama pushing a fully realized ACA proposal when he was running; his Big Idea was Yes We Can/Hope, and he made the country believe that was doable.\n\nNow, more than ever, we can't afford to end up with a Trump four more years. Unless someone can do an Obama-like break out, the Democrats can't afford to take the chance of losing in November.",

In a general election he may end up with even more votes than Hillary in blue states but he will lose the electoral college, so we will end up with an even less popular Trump for the next 4 years. Bernie fans will vote for him so he will end up with at least 30% of the primary voters. Given that the other 70% will be distributed among at least another 4 candidates there is a good chance Sanders will prevail, like Trump did in the Republican primaries. That scenario is a disaster for the US if the Senate does not change hands, four more years of Trump  and McConnell will take at least a generation to recover from, if ever.\nGiven the compressed primary schedule there is only one month left to prevent that by the other candidates dropping out except at most two. Sanders has done the country a great service by forcing Democrats to face the fact that some fundamental change is needed to make the US into true democratic country not beholden to plutocrats. But by persisting in his candidacy he is making it even more difficult to achieve that goal.",

Creating the caucus system was the beginning of the ongoing dilemma in the Democratic Party that because of the caucuses in early states, which strongly favors students and the young who are less likely to vote in the general election, the Party has been nominating someone who is too liberal on policy issues to win in the general election. The states that hold primaries come later in the calendar, and because of that, more people are involved in the primary elections in those states, but often it is too late by then for the primary election states to have as much influence on who is the nominee. The split creates the strong divide between the left and the center-left in the Democratic Party and the nobody-but-my-candidate enthusiasts. The Democratic Party needs a system of nomination that makes the person representing the Party in the general election the one who will emerge during the primary season. That will happen best through primary elections, not through caucuses if the rules require that people be available on that day and at that time and location. They prevent early voting and give most influence to activists but not necessarily to party leaders.

It may not be my personal favorite ticket, but it's one I can live with, although truth be told I will vote for any Democrat who wins the nomination.  The only one I would vote for reluctantly is Sanders, but I WILL vote as I have in every election since I was 18.  Don't vote and you risk giving carte blanche to a mean, narcissistic, self-serving, incompetent, mendacious, bully for a second term.   \n\nThe coming Wednesday acquittal of Trump by the Republican Senate majority sets a dangerous precedent.  But don't despair.  Trump never learns; he can't help himself.  He'll do it again as soon as he's acquitted.  I give him two weeks, tops.  He'll keep pushing the envelope.  How many times can his apologists and Alan Dershowitz twist themselves into pretzels trying to justify his outrages to the constitution, truth and human decency.   \n\nIf you love this country.

Trump ran on \"draining the swamp,\" so the DNC chose the most iconic swamp monster with the most baggage to run against him. Now they want Biden, who is in the same camp.

Just vote for SOMEONE. It won't get you everything you want, but it will be better.",

Our system is stupid.  Even before someone is sworn into office, our media starts asking: Who will run against him or her in four years and will/can he/she win?\n\nThe presidential election should have a six-month run up at the very most.  Candidates who hold other public offices are simply neglecting their jobs while they angle for attention and tease us with the will they/won't they declare their run as early as two or more years before they need to stand up and be counted.\n\nFolks are sick of sight of all of them by the time they limp to the finish line, not to mention all the money that's raised and all the corruption that tempts.  An eternal election suppresses votes more than it encourages them.\n\nStop the 20 people on stage debates and stop the primacy of Iowa and New Hampshire.

Other voters! \u2014 just aren\u2019t going to pick a woman.\"\n\nMaking fun of a reality doesn't make it go away. The USA (or, in the current usage: \"USA! USA! USA! USA!\") is a sexist patriarchal society. It's also home to a sizable contingent of simple-minded people who prefer an unhinged, blustering, Adderall-abusing draft-dodger in the role of Commander-in-Chief simply because he's a man and he talks tough. \n\nThey're apparently incapable of recognizing that a mentally disturbed ignoramus is far more dangerous than any emotionally stable woman. Their calculus is simple: Military = safety, Military = men, Men = safety. Never mind that men have started all the wars.\n\nHillary won a majority of the vote, so it's not that women can't win. But the game is rigged so that red states with comparatively tiny populations of old-fashioned patriarchalists own disproportionate power in the presidential election. What women should therefore be passionately fighting for is the elimination of that relic of slave-state politics, the Electoral College. Then a woman will win. Sadly, that won't happen this year.",

It is not difficult to see Bernie Sanders doing for the Democrats what Trump did for the Republicans, namely, sock it to them.  Unfortunately, any realistic read of what a socialist from Vermont close to eighty years of age would actually be able to accomplish is iffy to say the least.  What Senator Sanders could do is throw his influence behind Elizabeth Warren and let young voters decide on her running mate at the convention.  Her VP might even be Mike Bloomberg who could really make a statement by showing a willingness to play second banana for the sake of the nation's restoration.  It would be a fascinating duo---the woman who went after the one percent and one of its most prominent members with a desire to make amends for his billions.",

The US should adopt a few sensible campaign rules ( I know it will never happen but I can always dream). No political campaign, no ads, no rallies,\nnothing that smells of influencing voters should be allowed prior\nto a few months before the election.  The only thing allowed before that is for candidates to use volunteers to gather signatures during the election year, a dozen or so with the most signatures can then be considered serious candidates.\nOnce the campaign season starts a certain amount of free time on Radio ad TV should be allocated for candidates to make their case. That should save a ton of money and keep candidates focused on what they will be saying to voters in those few months instead of spending most of their time begging for donations. \nVoting should be mandatory, a citizen duty, just like jury duty is.\nFinally the voting should use ranking. That ensures the most disliked ones do not make the cut, the one elected has support from a majority (however tepid) and not the plurality of fanatic voters. And of course get rid of the electoral college. Whether these rules will produce the best Presidents is of course not guaranteed but they will prevent the worst.",

This is yet another in the endless media features that imbues the wholly undemocratic Iowa caucus system in Reagan-esque \"morning in America\" false nostalgia.  I'm more than cranky. I'm sick and tired of this tiny amount of people winnowing the field of candidates down to yet again old white males before my state and most Democratic voters get a chance to decide. The Iowa caucuses are unfair not just because they don't reflect the make-up of the Democratic party, but because they reward bullies who can go into a room and out-shout and coerce people into voting for their preferred candidate. If you think subtle persuasion is what works in the caucuses, you're sadly mistaken. They keep going at it until the most obstinate convince the weary others to capitulate. The only fair way, \"one  person, one vote,\" to select the nominee would be for us to do away not just with the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, but with the entire separate state-by-state primary system. We should have one national primary day, when party voters would go to the polls like they do in a national election, and vote for their preferred candidate. Only then would the candidates actually have to earn the nomination by campaigning in every state, and not just come to California for our money. Only then would the nominee actually be the choice of the whole party, instead of whoever is left to vote for after Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina narrow it for us.",

He meant none of it of course and anyone with a cursory awareness of his life history could have figured that out.

Wealth inequality has worsened , healthcare costs continue to rise and most Americans live lives of precarious struggle and existential disillusionment. \nBernie Sanders acknowledges this despair but for all those who try to equate him with Trump let me remind you he channels anger , resentment and disbelief into a positive vision for the future dedicated to restoring the notion of an egalitarian society where the health of the community is prioritized over faux rugged individualism and winner take all depravity. \nTrump vs Bernie ain\u2019t the battle of angry white guys . It\u2019s the choice between the politics of grievance and fear and the politics of vision and humanistic values . \nAmerica needs this fight and this clear choice of who and what we want to be as a country . \nIt\u2019s time we stop living in Ronald Reagan\u2019s world.",

Joe Biden is finished - even without the heavy shadow of corruption and nepotism cast by his daddy's boy's express lane to questionable wealth. Biden has neither gravitas nor color nor youthful energy. As for Elizabeth Warren, anyone who has has a plan for everything has a plan for nothing. By contrast, Donald Trump may not be the smoothest man in a suit, but his list of achievements as President - grossly unreported or underreported by the MSM - is legion and cannot be ignored.Virtually every American - especially those who would normally be default Democrat voters - has benefitted from the . current administration. And they vastly outnumber the noisy, unemployed, trust fund socialists buzzing around the Bern. Hence it is understandable why a Democrat Party, aware of the dismal odds, will turn the ousting of Trump by any possible means into a full time legislative obsession. We can look forward to more preening self righteousness from Adam Schiff, more gurgled waddling from Jerry Nadler, more sanctimonious sign language from Nancy Pelosi.

You have to be nuts to think that the Bernie/Warren/AOC Socialism and their take over of the US economy can pass either even a Democratic House or even harder get a 2/3 majority in any Senate. The name of the game is get someone in who can win, period (old school politics).\n\nKlobuchar being way down now in popularity is a long shot. But put you money on her nose, because if she can get out of the starting gate cleanly she'll win down the stretch.",

If Democrats really want to win, just close your eyes and give the nomination to Bernie Sanders. After all, he's only going to be the President for four years. I'm  saying this from numerous personal encounters here in Pennsylvania since 2016 with Bernie Supporters who are usually anti establishment and their Second Choice is normally either Trump or Stay Home. They don't trust the two major political parties or politicians except Bernie, because he's Independent like them. I don't  know why they only like Bernie, but I think because he's politically outcast like them by the two major political parties. Maybe They See Themselves In Him As The Enemy Of Their Enemies, so he's Their Friend.  Apart from Bernie, I don't see any other democratic presidential candidate that has that ability to mobilize this anti establishment and young difficult voters in swing states; and Democrats usually only win when young and independent voters turn out in large numbers. That's because young Independent voters usually vote more progressive than their conservative parents in swing states. That's why Hillary lost those three key swing states, including Michigan and Wisconsin that Sanders won during the 2016 primaries.",

I am concerned though that if Sanders doesn't get the nomination will his ardent supporters show up and vote for someone else?

A weak Senate, particularly one with a majority the same as the President, has demonstrated that the President can exercise powers that can harm U.S. standing in international affairs and be a disruptive force in global markets.  Under the U.S. Constitution, the Senate has unique powers in treaties, trade, and  advice and consent on the appointment of cabinet secretaries and other key positions in government. \n\nSo, my plea, we need to strengthen the Senate by using this election to inform the voters in the States that have seats in contest, about one third, to restore a Democratic Majority in the Senate.\n\nI strongly believe that a Democratic Majority in both houses can begin to build a Good Government.",

Qualifiers get public financing, a set, equal amount for each region's primary, based on the number of eligible voters in the region. No outer outside spending is allowed during the primarys period. No party money is allowed. No 'super-PAC's. No 'interest groups'. The entire 'running to nominated' cycle can take '5-6 months' instead of 'two weeks less than forever...' No more endless campaigns.\n\nAll kinds of good ideas out there that can be considered.

What we have to get into our heads is that a candidate like Sanders of Warren may appeal to a large number of overly optimistic and idealistic Democrats, and win primaries, they are going to turn off the Independents and center leaning Republicans who are critical for a win in November.\nThis election isn't about principal. It's about getting Trump out of the White House and stopping him from  ever appointing another Supreme Court Justice.\nSo here it is in Black and White, my fellow Democrats.\nGet off your high horses and nominate a candidate who can appeal to the largest number of voters in areas of the country that matter. All of your principals and dreams of free college educations and single payer healthcare won't mean a thing if we repeat the defeat of 2016. Sanders and Warren will be just as polarizing as Clinton and we simply cannot take that chance. Let's play it safe and rally behind a candidate who will give us the best chance at beating Trump.

I guess it's not that different from the large number of centrists who defected in 2008, when Clinton lost to Obama.  Obama won however with strong support from independents, young people, and people of color, and Sanders can also win. \n\nSupport for Sanders is growing because people support his stance on the issues and are willing to do the work to advance these issues.  In my estimation he has the best chance of beating Trump because he has built the widest most energized coalition.  \n\nIn 2016, Clinton outspent Trump and still lost.

If the NYTs does not get behind Sanders, if he is the Democratic candidate, it is flat out advocating for another 4 yrs of Trump. This election cycle the NYTs has not published one positive article on Bernie - not one. Get with it NYTs and let's get Trump out of the White House. If Sanders wins the nomination he will represent the majority of Democratic voters in 2020 and he has an excellent chance of beating Trump. That is because the majority of Americans are drawn to what he has stood for all his life. It is that simple. Sanders is not a fringe movement or a fan club.

Others?)   \n\n4)  She was a force behind the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.    Would the ousted Well-Fargo head have had to pay a $17 million fine without CFPB?  \n\n5)  She's pledged  to tax the wealthy.   Wealthy people  like Abby Disney and  Warren Buffet support that.  \n\nI like politicians  who are honest,  fair,  bipartisan --and well, yes, it doesn't hurt that she's a policy wonk.   Not with me,  anyway.   I find that refreshing.   And yes,  I have been contributing to her campaign.   I hope others will.

We've all seen how the Presidency can age an individual, and I wonder if the pressures of the office will just physically crush someone of that age group, no matter what they say about their health now.

In 2016, I was very excited to caucus and reveled in the experience. Four years later, it feels like everything has changed.\n\nFirst, I have a small child. Everyone we know who could babysit will be caucusing. Therefore my husband will have to stay home. This led to me to consider the other thousands of Iowans with no childcare, who work evenings, are home bound, or have no transportation. All are effectively disenfranchised. After months of living in a political circus, this seems unfair and downright wrong. It also limits our electorate to a very small group, potentially those more privileged further distorting the conversation about deservedness.\n\nSecond, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all aware of what's being written in these articles and by commenters who say we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve to be first because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re disproportionately white. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re desperately anxious about elevating the wrong candidate or prematurely winnowing the field. I am likely supporting Klobuchar with the hopes that she'll get her 15%.\n\nFinally, I have family and friends on the East Coast in later voting states. Almost none of them have watched any of the debates - we watched them, almost in their entirety, painful as it was. None are studying the candidates with the intensity we are because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the point - their preferred candidate may not be around. This is also wrong. The whole system is broken and needs to be changed.",

It will be unexciting,uninspiring, uninteresting and low energy. Biden's online or social media presence is negligible compared to Trump or Bernie Sanders.The largest crowd that Biden has drawn to his political rallies in his entire political life was 6,000 people in Philadelphia last Summer. Compare that to Bernie Sanders 26,000 Strong Energetic Crowds in New York last October. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF ENTHUSIASM. If Biden is the Nominee and polls show him defeating Trump on paper, many Democrats and Independents will not even be energized to actually vote and they will forget to actually vote in real life just as they forget to attend his rallies. Then Trump will energize all his 45 percent supporters to polling box and win re-election. That's Exactly What Happened To Hillary 2016, and it will be insanity to repeat it again in 2020 based on Albert Einstein Advice.",

While there are Americans struggling and the middle class always struggles with some expenses (college tuition) there has never been a period in American history where the middle class has done better.  And many Democratic promises, like college debt relief, are regressive, reward sloth, and make the middle class responsible for the debts of others.\n\nMore Americans have health insurance than any time in our history; likewise dental and vision insurance.  Yet Bernie shouts at every debate there are 80 million uninsured and underinsured Americans.  Last debate it magically increased to 87 million.  There are roughly 20 million uninsured Americans who could buy subsidized insurance if they chose to.  Minimum insurance coverage is mandated by federal law so by law there are no underinsured Americans. And the Dems' solution is a promise to take our insurance away?\n\nPeacetime unemployment has never been this low.  Wages for the lowest 10% are increasing faster than anyone else's.

The Us is very influential in world policies, and what the US do, matters for all of us.\n\n I've taken all the \"tests\" available and read about how the candidates stands on a lot of issues, though I miss information on several crucial matters, not the least on cross party cooperation, consensus policies and international cooperation.\n\nWhenever I take these tests two candidates come out at top. Warren and Steyer. With Klobuchar a distant third.\n\nThe Danish main stream politics are likely quite left leaning in US terms, but more importantly it is consistently consensus oriented, and that's what punishes Sanders in my regard. \n\nOur politics are about pushing the public consensus left, right or center, not about one tribe \"winning\" over the other with undeliverable promises. Our parliamentary democracy do not favor dividing populists, though we certainly have our share of them on the far out fringes.\n\nThe only real Danish radical political change in recent times is the climate concerns, and just about every political party has adopted climate policies as a priority. It's obvious our nation will not exist if the sea levels rise substantially. The highest point in Denmark is just 172 meters above sea level and most of our nation is considerably lower.",

Yes, people point to his time as a mayor, but I look to  his accomplishments in the Senate, which are few.  \n\nLet me just say No to the others (for want of space), and go to my two possibles: Amy Klobuchar  and Elizabeth Warren. Neither are polling well, but neither was Bill Clinton at this stage. They may be poles apart in policies, but I look more to what's possible where even a Democratic Senate needs Baucus or Manchin to pass legislation.

            "comment_body": "Trump is in a much stronger position than he was in 2016, but this doesn't mean that he'll win the popular vote. Unfortunately, the Democrats failed to make the Electoral College the crucial issue it should have been after their candidates lost the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections to candidates who won the EC but lost the popular vote. Democratic leaders should have vowed that they would never again allow the EC to determine a presidential election.  Blue states could have supported this by passing resolutions demanding that presidential elections be based on the popular vote beginning in 2020. Given that the EC's 21st century role is to provide small states an antidemocratic advantage over more populous ones, some blue states might have even signaled their intention to secede if the nation continued allowing the EC to determine presidential elections. No doubt, Republicans and their allies would have declared the Democrat's position as unconstitutional and unpatriotic, but the corrupt Trump administration, the majority of the GOPs legislative office holders, and their judicial stooges routinely ignore the Constitution whenever it's to their advantage. At some point a political party and the individuals within it must decide if they wish to continue playing a rigged game, fight for change, or walk away. If the Democrats truly wanted to wield power, then they must be willing to break a few eggs to get it. That they didn't do so may spell the end of the Republic.",

The Republicans are  making me hopping mad, profoundly frightened and absolutely disgusted with their anti-democratic behavior lately, and that's a fact.  Interestingly, the angrier I get about our once great democracy dissolving, the more I move toward Bernie and away from Biden, who I increasingly see as an ineffectual candidate. My favorite candidate is Elizabeth Warren, who reminds me of FDR every time she speaks, and I will certainly vote for her if she remains in the primaries.  If forced to choose between and Biden and Bernie, I would probably choose Bernie, as his positions are closer to Ms. Warren's platform, and in my mind Biden has done very little to distinguish himself as an outstanding candidate.  This is all reminding me too much of 2016, when the DNC kept pushing us toward the supposedly \"safe\" candidate, with the polls all insisting she could win without breaking a sweat.  Also, \"crazy Bernie\" isn't a very thoughtfully chosen nickname. It could work in his favor. People like crazy these days.  Trump is proof.",

None of the candidates will break out of Iowa because the candidates most able to beat Trump have either been pushed out of the primaries or happen to be Andrew Yang - legitimately the only one most people would be interested in hanging out with, and that is really how people vote. It isn\u2019t about policies or leadership in the end. It is about feeling like you like the candidate or that they understand you. \n\nBernie is surging because he has a populist message - but he has one that is the same as Trump\u2019s only different. Both of them inspire anger - which can be a powerful motivator but it means nothing will happen for either side -and while they duke it out the rest of us will suffer in the meantime.\n\nFurthermore, both are rehashing arguments I read about in history books - and I am 1/2 the age of Bernie - which makes me nearly 40 and a regular voter for 20 years! Our entire world changed with the smartphone. \n\nMaybe we can find a candidate who people like, who makes people hopeful and who feels normal and like one of us. That feeling is what beats Trump everywhere - not anger and not rational, well-crafted policy. But we probably won\u2019t because we are so angry and we all know how people just make the best decisions out of anger - just look at Trump!",

Do you remember Trump's margin of victory in the Electoral College? 60 votes---60! Beyond liberal enclaves in CA and NY, impeachment doesn't fly. It doesn't move the needle. If anything, it may help Trump stay in office. Is that what you want to happen, Democratic voters? I don't. Democratic primary voters are trying to convince themselves that anyone can beat Trump, even Warren or Sanders. Again, if you live in NY or CA, that sounds perfectly reasonable. In the rest of the US, Warren and Sanders are unelectable. No chance whatsoever of beating Trump. You Democratic voters have two choices: either focus on beating Trump, or focus on beating up Trump. Choice 1 gets you a new person in the White House come November. Choice 2 may make you sleep better at night, but it will result in the following headline on November 4: \"Trump garners 320 Electoral College votes.\" Don't believe it? Look at the 2016 election, and at the 1972 election. Please, do something in your party to get someone who is electable--and don't kid yourself about Warren, Sanders or even Biden. Your party needs a Buttigieg, Klobuchar or (my favorite) Bloomberg, people for whom we in America's great heartland can vote.",

Over the past 6 months his overall favorability rating has always been in first or second place. \n2. He inspires younger voters to vote for the first time and inspires Hispanic voters to vote for the first time.  Biden only inspires voters over 60.\n3. He has a wide lead in California and is virtually tied with Biden in first place in Texas. \n4. He performs better with independent voters than any other candidate. \n5. He is the only candidate that has the ability to win back the rust belt areas that Clinton lost in 2016 due to #8.\n7.  He has more female donors and volunteers than every other Democratic candidate combined.  He also leads among males. \n8. McCarthyite attacks on socialism do not work anymore because both major parties voted for trade deals which transferred millions of good jobs with pension to the Peoples Republic of China, where labor unions are illegal. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who voted against those trade deals.   \n9. The New York Times map on donor support indicates that Bernie has strong rural support.  Although the map is old, surely the Times would have updated it if Sanders was no longer in the lead in donor support nationwide.\n10. Trump won the Republican nomination and the electoral vote because he campaigned against the trade deals and the invasion of Iraq.  Bernie has a better track record on both of these issues than Trump and any of his Democratic competitors.",

Bernie is the perfect candidate to elucidate how Trump's policies have exacerbated the downward trend of the average person's situation.  After all, this has been Bernie's life work.  People voted for Trump in a desperate attempt to shake the status quo brought about by supply-side economics.  Instead, they got more of the same.  Now we can have a candidate who can appeal to those same voters, a candidate with authenticity and credibility without the corporate big-donor baggage attached to other candidates.\n\nWith Bernie, the Democratic movement to vote out Trump feels energized in a way that the presumed front runner status of Biden never accomplished.  I will vote for whomever Democrat emerges victorious from the primaries, but I think Bernie has the best chance of appealing to huge swaths of disenchanted voters and firing up the base.",

Iowa's unsuitability is exacerbated by a caucus system that is more anti-democratic than the combined efforts of Republicans to suppress the majority of voters.\n\nThat these states cling to their inordinate power in the electoral process is in keeping with Republican's belief that \"Real Americans,\"  usually those most subsidized by the rest of us, in small, rural states, should decide how the majority of Americans should be led.  It won't serve.\n\nThe repair is to lead with a Super Tuesday of representative states and sequence several more \"Super Tuesday's.\"  All could begin later in the election year to shorten the process and do less damage to the Party and its nominee.\n\nTrump and the Republican Party have clearly told us who they do not want to oppose.  I suspect no need to dig up dirt on Bernie.  They will have at least a billion dollars to advertise that he is a big gov't socialist who wishes to take away your health insurance and hugely increase your taxes.  Those ads will have the benefit of being true and uncontested, except by the weak response to  moderate voters that he is a Democratic Socialist. \n\nPeople who do not believe that will stick evidently believe medicare for all and higher taxes will be passed by a senate that includes Republicans.

I choose the latter every time. There will never be another \"safe\" election. The Republican Party is only getting worse. The only way we break out of this cycle -- the only way we get millions of people healthcare and out of poverty -- is by changing flipping the script and tearing down the status quo. Trump did not fall from the sky. He was an inevitability of sorts of all of our nation's sins and mistakes over the last few decades.

I was wrong about Hillary in 2016, after all. But how many times are we going to fail and lose with the \"safe\" option before we decide to go a different course?

And many on the right and middle despised Hillary.\n\nBernie also won 43% of the popular vote in the primaries.   The \"I like Bernie but...\" statement was always followed by he can't win.  Polls said then, and now, Bernie could beat Trump by 11 points.  However the centrist was the nominee and she lost.  We have done this experiment already, the DNC chose their centrist candidate via superdelegates and she lost.  Let's not repeat it.\n\nIt is amazing how well Bernie is doing even though the media and Wall Street hates him.  This country has always been for and by the wealthy.  Bernie would make it truly for and by the people!",

It just passed 10,000 MW nameplate capacity after 4th quarter 2019. In October and November 2019, more than half of the in state electricity generation was by wind power. Bernie et al should be promoting high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission through Illinois to get Iowa wind to eastern US markets. Perfect timing to do so given Illinois politics as usual might get unusual given the Fed's interventions. \n\nEthanol: Iowa is number one in corn. A big chunk of corn production goes to processing ethanol. US total ethanol production is over 1 million barrels per day or roughly 10 percent of gasoline consumption. That keeps somewhere around 2 million barrels of crude oil per day from having to get produced and refined. I'm guessing here, but a good assumption to make is that ethanol isn't liked by the oil patch either, chiefly refiners - so some environmental groups are in good company (satire).",

If I had to pick a winner, I would go with Trump due to the EC and how the two leading progressive candidates struggled in polls against Trump. Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin aren't the same as a solid blue state. Let alone Texas, Arizona, or Florida which are in play nowadays. Yet polls don't show Trump losing to Sanders or Warren today. That said, the moderates fare better, but still a tossup. Again, this is today, so things can change. \n\nThe fact of the matter is why is Iowa deciding the process? The state went heavily for Trump, and has elected Steve King. To me the state doesn't represent the Democrats at all, or even moderate Democrats. It's basically farmers, a mid-size city, and college students. It's not diverse, not a wide range of issues, and somehow they decide who will have to appeal to bigger states who have a diverse range of problems. The primary process needs to be reform, and after Trump I wish the parties decide their nominee since I'm struggling at trusting the people voting on facts over emotion at this point.",

These negative messages stick. It's like the whole Biden \"thing\". If a reporter actually looked at other Senators (Lamar? Barraco?

Their are two issues in this election: who will be the best against Trump, and will this election be fair? Iowa no longer represents the United States. It will make Dems stay home.

My friends who are Independent voters here in Pennsylvania really like him since 2016, though some of them voted for Trump as their second choice when Bernie dropped out 2016. Why are democrats so fixated on Joe Biden even when it's obvious his image is already tarnished? A new Texas Lyceum poll just released shows Bernie Sanders in a virtual tie with Donald Trump in Texas, and doing far better than Joe Biden in that head-to-head matchup with Trump because Bernie wins over many independents like himself. Biden is behind Trump by 5 points in that poll. The poll is debunking the whole Biden's argument that he's the best candidate to defeat Trump in moderate states like Texas. In terms of Democratic primary in Texas, the Texas Lyceum poll also shows Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden in a virtual tie in Texas too; with Bernie Sanders doubling his numbers from the last poll by the same Texas Lyceum from 13 to 26. As reported by several media outlets, this new poll is sending the democratic establishment scrambling.",

If it doesn't, we might have brokered.  \nWe also have a big primary day on March 17, and I think the last big one is the first week in April.  It is virtually all done in two months.  At that point a winning nominee will be declared or unlikely but still possible this year, the nomination will go to the floor of the convention in July.  \n\nAnd that is it. The first week in April is seven months from the actual federal election that will decide the fate our democracy.  The Democrats need to mobilize like never before to make sure they win.

He was also the head of the data science and research, which included polling. Parscale claims that after realizing Virginia and Ohio were unable to be swayed, he decided to re-allocate the campaign resources to Michigan and Wisconsin. This shift included the decision to send Trump to Michigan and Wisconsin and focus efforts heavily on the two states. This decision was instrumental in winning the election as Trump won both the historically democratic states....\n\nParscale did not have data scientists or any digital team during the Republican Primary and did much of the social media advertising from his home...\n\nParscale was able to utilize Facebook advertising to directly target individual voters in swing states.[22] . Although he hired Cambridge Analytica to assist with microtargeting and Cambridge Analytica stated that it was the key to Trump's victory...

This idea of ignoring the mainstream media seems paranoid and cynical to me.  If voters want to get their information from Facebook friends who they agree with they are risking an independent assessment of the facts.  Group think was a problem that caused the Iraq war.  I didn\u2019t come up with that, my professor did.  Group think is dangerous!",

Time to get off their high horse and start doing things that\u2019ll win them votes... if they used the last 3 years to get work done and engage voters or may be even pass useful legislation! using Facebook or whatever other channel to enhance their chances of winning, instead of trying to get trump impeached they would be in a much better position for the 2020 elections.\n\nConclusion: Trump will win 2020... and Pelosi and Schumer need to be replaced with strong, centrist operatives that understand how the modern world works, taking advantage of tools like Facebook vs. Complaining about them... it doesn\u2019t seem that difficult to understand this for me!",

Facebook's only practical option will be to stick it's head in the sand to avoid any such knowledge -- any attempts to monitor or screen users' comments will only increase its risk of publisher liability.  What you'll get is more of a \"wild west\" online.\n\nSecond, let's be clear what Soros is advocating for:  manipulation of news, information and communications to serve political goals.  Regulation of what information you and me are entitled to hear.  \n\nIf you ask me, the more information available online, the better.

Once the govt takes over, the political party establishes the controls and the bureaucrats enforce them. \nFor every Zuckerberg, there are probably three media outlets controlled by and used by those with views on the political left. So there is no real threat of dominance by Zuckerberg. \nThe real concern of Soros is that citizens and voters with more traditional views tend to use Facebook. Soros wants to get to these voters control the information they can get. Not only are these the unwashed, stupid individuals who shop at Walmart and do all those other crude things cited by the Left, but their main fault is that many support Trump and his ideas. Therefore, it is critical that they be fed the proper left propaganda and vision. \nNotice that Soros is described as only as philanthropist at the top.

I don't like it and I use a number of news sources to build a mosaic of \"truth\" in today's events.  Facebook and Twitter are not my primary sources but I can't see a way where there is any apolitical GORT (see when \"The Earth Stood Still\") that can decern and filter truth and political \"truth\"  \n\nI am not naive enough to think that Mr. Zuckerberg doesn't have a profit motive but, with 2.5 billion users, applying Occam's razor leads to this conclusion: Facebook is its most efficient revenue-generating when the most users see it as passthrough of community interest information.  That includes those of the \"village idiots\" from all ends of the political spectrum.  Fundamentally it is a manifestation of the US' First Amendment (no wonder China bans it).  \n\nI am a big proponent of removing all barriers for people being able to vote.  With that comes the realization that many, perhaps will not vote in the same way I would (democracy - go figure...)   Mr. Soros appears to advocate for his vision of thought (laudable in many respects) that leads to a better world.  He also points to \"low hanging fruit\" of abuses of social media that have significantly affected many.   Where does the line get drawn?  Who gets to draw it? Me?  Mr. Soros?

Nowhere. Just like there was no outrage from the left about executive orders under Obama. It\u2019s not facebooks job to identify false speech. They are NOT a news organization. Speaking of which, if fox and nytimes actually did a better job telling the truth, people wouldn\u2019t turn to outlets such as facebook and twitter to know whats going on. It has always been the job of adults to read the news from multiple sources and come up with conclusions. To take that responsibility off of us and put it onto a corporation is infantilizing. Most people primarily get on facebook to keep in touch with their friends, share memes and schedule events. The natural by product of that is discussing things in their lives, including politics. That does not need to be regulated by government. That\u2019d be like going into a barbershop and holding the owner responsible for some outrageous claims somebody is making about candidate so and so. Facebook is basically a national chain of barbershop talk. People talk about cars, girls, guys, politics, war, parenting tips etc...just like they do in a barbershop. I don\u2019t need a billionaire telling me how to talk in my community.",

The PRR became the largest railroad in the world using the metric of revenues and traffic.\n\nFacebook, 140 years later, employing the latest technologies of the day, extended its connected users eventually across the globe.  Facebook has become an electronic information analog of the PRR, based on the similar metric of revenues and information traffic.\n\nAn important 19th Century concept is both relevant and transferable to today.  The concept is that of the Robber Baron.  Robber Barons were admired for their acquisition of wealth and power.  They were hated and reviled for the harm they inflicted on the health and financial well-being of others, on politics and later, on the environment.  A Baron is a title of nobility \u2013 that is a class above the larger population.  It is also an inheritable title and rank in society.\n\nThere are entirely practical day-to-day implications for Americans in the ascendancy of Facebook, and hence Zuckerberg.  One has only to read Thomas Piketty, \u201cCapitalism in the Twenty-First Century\u201d and subsequent work by him and other workers and consider his \u201cU-Shaped Curve\u201d to grasp the changes taking place in America and in her politics.",

Consequently, the application of that law to protect the likes of Facebook is an extreme category error.  In 1996 website hosts (which the law was intended to protect against liability) were like bookstores.  The 1996 Act was modeled after case law that protected bookstores (distributors of content) from liability, but not content publishers.  Web hosts in 1996 were akin to bookstores upon which website creators published their sites.  The website creators were still subject to civil liability suits.  However, in the age of Web 2.0 things are much more complicated because Facebook is not like a passive website host but has algorithms that structure content in far from passive ways.  In that sense, even though it\u2019s machine algorithms as opposed to humans that are constructing what\u2019s presented to the subscriber, those algorithms were written by humans with specific human motivated goals.  Congress needs to revisit the Communications Decency Act in accord with the vast changes that have occurred in the internet since 1996 (24 year!) and come down squarely in defense of objective truth and not algorithmically driven distortions of truth.",

All of this led to an Electoral College decision that put Trump in the Oval Office despite the fact that Hillary had 3 million more votes. The problem lies with this: the American people have sloppy minds--they are unable to spot fake ads and videos (whether Right or Left wing) posted on Facebook and other social platforms.

FB has been linked with increased polarization and misinformation about life saving vaccines; is related to increased social distress among heavy users (including social media addiction which leads to maladaptive cognition and increased rates of self harm); is linked to casual attitudes about vaping among teens;  is related to increased loneliness among active adolescent users and a host of other social problems for adults, teens and children alike. It affects attitudes about climate change.

In social media, there is one set of models (among many) that leverage human social behavior that I think fits this article.  It is often called the Typing of Social Interactions - made up of Altruism, Cooperation, Spite, and Selfishness. \n\nOn any social media platform, there are hundreds of algorithms determining your social interaction interests and uses this information to then \"help\" you find groups of similar interests - your own tribes.   A major reason I left Silicon Valley was that the powers of incitement politics (Trump, Fox, Beck, Limbaugh, etc.)  drove people to spiteful and selfish relationships and the sites that support these views on a variety of platforms (Facebook, twitter, etc.), basically leaving altruism and cooperation in the dust.  I and my peers have no technical remedy for this.  This is about human nature and not technology.\n\nA few nights ago I was watching Frontline's America's Great Divide.  This documentary is made up of interviews of leading social analysts, including Robert Reich,  David Axelrod, Frank Luntz, Steve Bannon, and others.  Their dialog very much addresses the uncontrollable power of social media.  And how spite and selfishness along with incitement politics impact social and voting behavior.  You can see the individual interviews (which I recommend) on YouTube.  Social media is purely a weapon that brings out the worst in us - period.",

Vetting political speech is a non-starter; it is unworkable, and would seriously undermine the free speech guarantees of the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe New York Times and much of the liberal mainstream media regularly supports and endorses political candidates.  And, incidentally, the largest NY Times stockholder is a citizen of Mexico, a foreign country.  The Times very much achieves economic benefit from leaning to the left, matching the political persuasions of much of the paper's subscriber base.\n\nWould you like to shut down the Times, Mr. Soros?\n\nMost of the commentary that appears in social media, including Facebook, likely leans to the left, so I don't know why you are concerned.

            "comment_body": "Trying to cut the Facebook cord is difficult. In 2008, I joined Facebook after the birth of my first daughter because it made it much easier to share photos and videos of the new babe with all  our far-flung family and friends. Since then, I have joined various creative groups, neighborhood groups and often use my FB login credentials to log in to web sites--even NYTimes.com. Also, FB actually houses many many \"memories\"--all those old posts pop up and make me feel nostalgic, which is lovely. In 2020, cutting the Facebook cord for me means no longer being dialed in to my literal and virtual communities. Still, because I'm appalled at the platform's lack of ethics or integrity, sickened by its leadership's laissez-faire attitudes about honesty and morality, my goal for this year is to avoid FB as much as possible. Already, I rarely post personal photos anymore. I've stopped using FB to login to sites, and do not \"share\" articles anymore, either. It is now time to sacrifice the visceral and utilitarian benefits of Facebook because in his undeniable hubris, Mark Zuckerberg has demonstrated that he couldn't care less about truth, justice, or the direction of this country. Now, Instagram...that's another story. (Jeez, Zuck really has a monopoly.)",

There is no need to provide original content, just copy a story you saw somewhere else and express \"outrage.\n\nI have facebook friends on opposite sides of the political divide so I see these one-sentence \"outrage\" comments.  They facilitate formation of \"in-groups\" which can then pressure all of us to take action.\n\nThe problem is that the action is never fully thought out.\n\nIt would be better if people could only forward essays they had written with original content.  This would at least force them to think the issues through.\n\nAn example is Jane Fonda marching about global warming and getting arrested.  The problem is that we need a low-emotion discussion of HOW to fight global warming.  It is not really an issue that should divide us into us-versus-them.\n\nThe development of Facebook and Twitter does threaten our democracy.  It increase partisanship without thought.  The slow discussion of solutions would help us realize that there are at least two sides to every issue, as Jim Lehrer, a journalist from an earlier era, used to tell us.\n\nI don't know the solutions.
