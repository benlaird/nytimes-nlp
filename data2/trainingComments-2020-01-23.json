Also taking from your expressions, you seem to be more intent on finding validation rather than the truth of God's word for yourself. \n\nReal church is more like family; one that is only united in perfection by Christ's love. Its never about the people, the \"Pastor\" or you, it's about Christ. No one can give us that true validation we seek, if we're being honest..there'll always be that great void or emptiness only He can fill. Your goal, if you choose, should be seeking to become more like Him; and don't ever feel like this is impossible to attain, simply ask for His help as genuinely as you can. \n\nDon't stop sseking, and I pray you get your answers soon bro! Love.",

            "comment_body": "I was also raised Roman Catholic, in a more liberal arm of the Church, and as the Church turned Right Wing, I turned Left... as in, left the Church. I didn't go searching in yet MORE conservative bastions for acceptance. I knew I wasn't going to find it. It was not going to be forthcoming. I decided, no gods for me. Mostly, I've been okay for that. I still miss the cultural aspects of Church. I don't miss the nonsense.\n\nA friend of mine, Came Out in his mid 20s. He was extremely devout. Unlike me, he was an Evangelical. His Church was his LIFE. He couldn't see existing without his God. He spent several years searching for a Church, in conservative northern middle Tennessee which would accept him and his partner. He traveled to Nashville, 90 minutes one way. Even that proved ultimately fruitless. \n\nThen with a few friends, he started his own church. At first, they brought in a pastor from the city. It took several years. It met some local resistance. But he was affable, talented, pleasant. It didn't hurt that his father was a respected local political figure. His church and its rainbow banners *flourished.* Everyone is welcome. \n\nSometimes when you can't find the right community for you, you have to start one. Find a denomination that is affirming of LGBT+. Ask them if they will send a missionary. Or if you can simply start a  mission yourself. \n\nNelson, if there is nothing for LGBT folks where you are, you have a light, you do not put it under a bushel. Start something.",

I am not gay, but it seems like in the US for many years it was left to the founding of a new church, the Metropolitan Community Church, that had a specific mission of outreach to the LGBTQ community and other minorities, to provide a safe home for Christian gays.\n\nIt is only in recent years that some other Christian churches in the US have begun to openly welcome gays with true equality.

I am a Nigerian myself and like most Nigerians, I was raised in church and with faith which means I understand the draw back to church. The sad truth is Nigeria and Nigerians are stuck in their ways and refuse to change, our people are very traditional and refuse accept a different way of life. Nigerians are very stuck in what they believe and those who believe differently are considered wrong. \nI was raised in Lagos and i moved to the states for school when I was 14.\n I'm an adult now and my views and how I live my life are a bit different than what I was raised with and I have had multiple people(Nigerians in Nigeria) tell me that my views are wrong because they aren't what the community believes and I am not even a member of the LGBT community.\nI am say this because I don't think it's worth it to wait for Nigeria to change its views on the LGBT community because these are proud people who hold on very tightly to their culture and beliefs. \nI think if you can't find a community in  Lagos, you should build one for yourself.",

The UMC has recently been in the news over the proposed schism over the issue of LGBTQ acceptance, although the debate has been going on longer than that. It hurts to have your humanity debated publicly and it hurts to feel like you have to prove yourself worthy of love and acceptance from the one place it should easily be universal.

Conservative African churches, financially supported by their more liberal branches in the west, consistently vote against those churches core values where homosexuality is concerned. In my Anglican church, Nigerian members twice voted down new pastors whom were married and gay. This really angered many of the white western congregants, and it is only a matter of time until it causes an international schism. I hear that the Methodist church is grappling with this same issue at present and may vote to stop supporting African churches whom refuse to accept homosexuality as a a valid and valued lifestyle. What choice do they have? Young Americans are fleeing conservative churches in droves and with them go future payments that support African churches that insist on rigid Old Testament adherence.",

            "comment_body": "There will be those who suggest the Bible offers a fixed understanding of sin, sexuality, and marriage.  That is simply not true.  The Bible offers a contextual understanding of sin, sexuality, and marriage.  The context of life has changed in the roughly four thousand years since the earliest extant copies of scriptural texts were written.  Marriage, for instance, was the union of a man and women in the time of the patriarchs, and arguably was at the time of Christ as well.  The shift to marriage as the union of two people was a foundational shift in understanding.  Likewise, the notion that two people should marry because of love was a seismic shift in understanding.  \nWhat hasn't shifted is Jesus's teaching that those who would like to hold up one aspect of the Law will be held accountable for the whole Law.  So, those who glibly hold up Leviticus and Genesis as clobber texts to justify their views of sexuality must be prepared to uphold all 613 commandments of the Law.  \nEven more, an understanding of the teachings of the Newer Testament regarding sexuality that does not consider the meaning of the words themselves will be inherently flawed.  The Greek term arsenokoitai specifically targets those who engaged in temple prostitution and those who frequented them.  \nThere is far more nuance than a simple dismissal of homosexual orientation as being unbiblical will permit.  \nJesus, though, is clear: \"Come to me all you who are weary and carrying heavy burdens.\"",

            "comment_body": "Many people apparently find it hard to grasp the scale and scope of the climate problem. For starters, we have to replace the entire global fossil fuel-based energy system -- electricity, transport, heating and cooling -- with alternatives that don't destroy the climate. And we have to do it quickly, because we've wasted decades and will reach a tipping point after which the warming feeds on itself and becomes unstoppable. Until we achieve that, warming continues.\n\nBut even achieving that just stops making matters worse. If we are to return to the climate humans evolved to live in, we'll need to remove a lot of the extra CO2 we've exhausted to the atmosphere by burning enormous quantities of coal, natural gas and petroleum -- and store it back in the ground or into some other form resistant to re-emission.\n\nThe ONLY hope of doing any of this (and it's slight at this point) is through serious action by governments of all the major emitters, i.e., the rich countries. Individual action will be far too little and definitely too late.\n\nThis will cost a lot of money. But consider the alternative. Consider that you're in a car heading toward a cliff and you can spend a lot of money to stop the car. We, as a species have so far decided to \"save\" the money. Off the cliff we go!",

Buying a $80,000 electrical car isn't as good for the environment as a $15,000 compact combustion energy driven vehicle.\n\nAs unglamorous as it may be, the keys to reducing global warming are dramatically curtailing consumption of physical goods.

Since the current population of earth is 7.8 billion, that would have cut global carbon emission by a factor of about 8.\n\nOK, it would be less than that, because controlling population growth would have many of the poor in the third world to raise themselves out of poverty, and as more wealthy consumers would be using more fossil fuels.  But that would be a good thing.  And we would still likely have much lower consumption of hydrocarbons and an easier path towards a future free of fossil fuels.\n\nIn 1968, Paul Ehrlich published the Population Bomb, and in Meadows et al published a more extended treatment of possible scenarios under continued population increase in 1972.  The population then was about 3.6 billion.\n\nPundits and journalists held these prophets up for ridicule.  It was said that controlling population growth was \"similar\" to eugenics.  That it was an attempt to keep the number of poor people down.  Therefore it was \"racist.\"\n\nWhat did we do in 1968 or 1972?  Nothing.\n\nNow talking heads everywhere deny that the doubling of population in Africa is a problem.  We should not interfere with the divine act of procreation.\n\nThey could not be more wrong.",

We sued, lambasted, shamed, dismantled, outlawed; did everything in our power to force the blame for smoking on tobacco executives who, indeed, buried data about the health risks of smoking (even though pretty much everyone knew, even in the 1960s, that cigarettes caused cancer).  At any rate, what worked?  A brilliant, organized public campaign that made smoking undesirable, unfashionable and disgusting, together with taxes that made cigarettes unaffordable.  Consumers responded by smoking less (to a point).  Can it be done with energy?  Probably not because unlike, say, gasoline, cigarettes serve no public good.  None.  Zero.  Aside from the pleasure of smoking and the jobs the industry supported, as a product, cigarettes are pure, negative social value.   Gasoline, for all of its environmental costs, also has immense social value that doesn't need to be explained.  So demonizing gasoline won't work when it has so many demonstrable beneficial uses.  But there are substitutes (electric cars) that are gaining traction, that's good.  But the point is, going after the corporations and evil executives, even with an easy target like cigarettes, didn't change public attitudes and get people off of cigarettes (although it made a lot of plaintiff lawyers rich).  It took a big change in consumer behavior for that, and it happened because consumer attitudes shifted, prices went up, and demand plummeted.",

Think of The Times' recent articles on the realities of \"recycling\" in Indonesia and Southeast Asia.  And I don't expect better from governments.  We're all too likely to see an eventual collapse to a soundtrack of burps from companies and governments patting themselves on the back for doing almost nothing.

Do you think for a billionth of a second that the Saudi's, the Nigerians or anyone else in OPEC is going to stop drilling for oil? It's NEVER going to happen in our lifetime. NEVER. Every ounce ...& I mean every ounce is coming out of the ground into our cars & factories. Oil is the source of Saudi Arabia's power. The kingdom relies on oil revenue to pay for its massive domestic & military spending. Just to break even, the Saudis needs a pump as much oil as possible. Huge production cuts would force Saudis to drain their shrinking pile of cash, borrow money or scale back dividends paid by Aramco. According to CNN oil output from non-OPEC countries is expected to surge too, by a record 2.3 million barrels per day in 2020. That would easily top the previous record of 1.96 million sets in 1978. The US shale oil revolution is a big contributor to the coming gush of oil. US production is expected to climb by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2020. Norway & Brazil are also expected to add 1 million barrels per day next year. In the next ten years, we will be drowning in an ocean of oil. That's our reality.

But little accounting is done to add up the costs and benefits.  Consider all the externalities for both and the outcome is less certain.  We must consider many things:\n\nFor fossil fuels:\n- Subversion of good governance by petro-states (cf. Equatorial Guinea)\n- Ecological effects of fracking, mountain top removal and drilling on the local regions where they occur\n- Issues with transportation including pipeline rupture, oil spills from tankers, \"bomb trains\"\n- Effect on cancer rates from aerial hydrocarbons\n- Losses from evaporation or inefficient engines (e.g. lawn mowers)\n- Mercury and cadmium contamination from coal burning\n- PM 2.5 pollution from combustion\n- Rupture of coal ash confinements\n\nFor green tech:\n- Electrical line losses\n- Nuclear waste disposal\n- Difficulty in obtaining rare earth minerals for generators\n- Intermittency of sun, wind and tides\n- Battery inefficiency\n\nEach approach has difficulties.

Making money off the internet is quite common, but let's not forget that for every dollar earned by Amazon, Macy's or Kohl's loses a dollar. Malls are empty of major stores. Plenty of people are losing retail jobs, just as technology jobs are plentiful.\n\nNo one argues that green technology won't have a huge impact on society, but prudent corporate managers need to figure out exactly how to make money off green before investing the billions required.\n\nWe also need to figure out how to retrain all those workers whose livelihoods depend on coal, gas, and oil.\n\nElizabeth Warren and AOC rashly claim we can create millions of green jobs, but they have yet to articulate exactly what  those jobs are, what training is needed to perform those jobs, where those jobs will be located, and how much they will pay.\n\nIt's easy to make bold claims, a lot harder to make it happen.",

There is an integration of hydrogen into natural gas, to the tune of about 20%, that renders the gas more efficient and decrease emissions of carbon monoxide, a lethal gas.  Hydrogen can be reliably be stored in underground caverns and pumped up when it's needed to keep electricity flowing at times when solar and wind generation is limited.  Batteries may work well for energy storage in cars.  But they're too expensive to store excess energy generated by solar and wind sources.  It is estimated that a significant proportion of that sustainable energy is currently wasted due to lack of storage capacity.  And hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe.  Scarcity will never be a problem.  Me, I'm going with hydrogen with my investments.",

Secondly, by refusing to participate in a serious and meaningful way: they know exactly the lies they are telling are not true, but they cling to them as a means to throw confusion and discord back at the People. And lastly, and perhaps more importantly, using the power of Congressional investigations in Bill Clinton's second term to prosecute an almost never-ending inquiry into his past and then-present. The Special Prosecutor started out looking at a questionable (by Republican standards) land deal, and ended with a deposition in which Clinton took a lawyerly approach to answering a very private question about his sexual relationship with an intern.

In much the same way legal analysis can fall off the edge of the two-dimensional piece of flat paper and fail to serve the 4-dimensional to multi-dimensional universe it exists in.\n\nFor example, Gorsuch's argument re the trucker - with caveats that he thought the law was dumb, the trucking company's retaliation was dumb, but the trucker should have still stayed in the truck and frozen to death, or been amenable to losing his job. All he had to do was ask why the heater in the truck was not working. If it was the trucker's fault, he needs to realize he was operating a vehicle without the proper safety equipment and should expect to be fired for his negligence. If it was the company's fault then they need to explain why they sent this trucker out in a defective vehicle and did not offer him a timely remedy.\n\nInstead, being an over-educated, upper-middle-class American Aristocrat he pretended like the law is an infallible and inflexible dictum handed down from the Gods and he was just there to state it even if he thought it was not sensible and even plain wrong. \n\nA simple test is \"will I consider this justice if it happened to my friends and also my enemies?\"",

Trump is proof of that.

Anything he is perceived by his supporters to have accomplished while in office is the product of smoke and mirrors and spin, always the exhausting, mind boggling spin. Politicians and power brokers in his corner are bedazzled by the money he commands or terrified of the axe he somehow wields through the voters he has mesmerized. He is the personification of every flaw in a system riddled with them, the nightmare the country's founders must have known could come true, an embarrassment to himself and the country alike. One cannot defend him. He is a mistake that should never have happened - didn\u2019t actually happen, using the popular vote as a yardstick.

Accordingly, these offenses require a specific remedy--impeachment.\n\nAs for the process of impeachment and trial, although we have analogized it to a criminal trial it is hardly like a criminal trial at all.  The penalty upon conviction is permanent loss of the public office. In this way, it is more like being fired than being convicted of any crime. \n\nIn the end, a party that would have Trump as its standard bearer is hardly likely to be offended (or even surprised) that Trump assumes it is a sinecure. Nothing in the man's makeup or background suggests that he has any concern with the Constitution or the niceties of precedent or decorum. Nor is  anything he says or does particularly concerned with the welfare of the United States.  His concern is with himself and his own power and financial well-being. To the degree that Trump has any other concerns, it is solely with his 'base.' Republicans cannot imagine that Trump has committed an impeachable offense because he is doing exactly what they hired him to do.\n\nSo, in my analysis, an impeachment is better analogized to whether Trump has committed a 'fireable' offense rather than any class of statutory or common law offenses.",

Even bribery, one of the two specific impeachable offenses listed in the Constitution, would not be encoded in federal statute until 1962.

This ignorant, Fox News-fueled talk about the \"deep state\" and \"rogue elements in the FBI and CIA is nothing more than Goebbels-type propaganda from the wrong doers. So many lazy minds on the right who apparently don't understand or embody the concepts of integrity, honor, truthfulness, empathy and just good common sense about what is right and what is wrong. Four government officials of impeccable character and long service testified to the wrong doings of Trump, a man who never misses a chance to stuff his pockets with taxpayer money and who uses the military as a prop for his disconnected ramblings. You Trump supporters ask yourself, \"Is this the kind of person I would want my children to emulate? Is this the code of honor that I live by? Has he made the life of struggling Americans, not millionaires, better\" If you answer is yes, I feel sorry for you as you have lost your moral compass. My point was do you want your children growing with the values such as morality, integrity, honesty, service, truthfulness and duty to country that is so lacking in the individual who is now in the White House.",

McMahon is a master melodramatist, creating ingenious scenarios for the wrestler-entertainers to learn and then perform.  Trump performed as a 'Heel' at one event, shaving McMahon's head. \nThe resistance to the three-day limit by 'moderate Republicans' culminating in the change to three days gives the impression that the Republican senators are not in lockstep with the President and so will be impartial.  Here is classic pro-wrestling storytelling. Let the audience think the 'good guy' might get beat, let a few moves and punches succeed. Mix it up for a while.  Otherwise, it will look like there was never any competition.  Otherwise, it will seem like the senators are sycophants.\nTrump's brand (the style of a wrestling character) is a hit.  The golden brushed back hair, tan, sneering cockiness, nicknaming enemies, outlandish rants, disregard for authority, bored with formality, and all the rest is pure pro wrestling thrills-a-second showmanship. Wrestling promoters learned that fans like their 'sport' to be fake.

The NYTimes knows it, Donald Trump knows it, and we all know it. I am not even sure that I understand why the NYTimes keeps pointing out how bad a person he is.\n\nI think that the real story is why do tens of millions of Americans voted for him and still support him, despite all the scandals and evidence of wrongdoing. The presence of Donald Trump at the White House has something to do with this support, the disenchantment of rural America and the underlying causes that convinced people to rabidly follow him. Democrats should really try to understand these causes and the mindset of people affected by these causes.  Unless they propose solutions that Republican-leaning voters can understand and agree with, they are not kicking Trump out of the White House. Impeachment or not. I'd like to read articles and analysis about that in the NYT!",

TV courtrooms with video of the previous sworn testimonies are a lot more compelling and less complex to absorb to those who probably never understood the details of the Ukranian saga before (even some senators) during those tedious first days of nonstop hearings. They are excellent real life counterpoints especially when played  back to back against the backfiring words of the self-proclaimed \"impeachable One.\" They must not allow his portrayal of himself as a victim to continue. It is predictable that in the end he will announce himself to having been exonerated but at the very least the testimonies of those believable witnesses must substantiate the fact that he has indeed already been impeached by the House of Representatives. Perhaps in the end those other witnesses will serve as vindication and consolation by the Democrats as well as sway some of those who had not yet decided if Trump had indeed abused his power.",

They would marvel at his appearance and mentality, from the tip of his cloud of white blond dyed puffy hair through his orange glossy-cheeked face-paint, porcine bulk disguised behind a very long bright red tie and ill-fitting blue suit as a mirage, as a frightening chimera of the future.\u00a0\n\nCan we know, Gail, what the young men who created our democracy would think of our inarguably dreadful commander in chief who tweeted his people a record 140 times yesterday during his Senate Impeachment Trial?\u00a0 Our Constitution framers would be still and pay heed to court proceedings without resorting to frequent food and drink breaks, cloakroom breaks to look at their forbidden iPhones,working a hidden crossword.\u00a0 Our\u00a0 young FFs paid attention in the 1700s to abuses from the English Monarchy and rebelled and created American democracy.

In 1974 there were newspapers and only four TV networks offering news. There was no internet to allow any idiot to pontificate and reach a broad and large audience. Although the judiciary and specifically the Supreme Court reaching a unanimous decision that Nixon could not hide the tapes set the table for the endgame, it was the press that was the hero of 1974 because curated, sourced, professionally delivered, with opinion soft-pedaled if not absent, the news once had power. Today, not so much. And in that vacuum, Trump has proven that a shameless man can get away with anything.",

But there's no way the four Presidential candidates have had time to absorb any but the \"Impeachment for Dummies\" version of events.\n\nToo bad an exam isn't required to determine whether any of what Schiff and his colleagues are laying out in such compelling detail.  But if there were such a requirement, I feel safe in saying that a majority the GOP Senators would get wrong the first question on the exam: Who is being impeached?  The leading response would likely be Hillary Clinton, or Barack Obama.",

But our Founding Fathers realized that abuse of power could be committed not only by the President of the United States but also the Congress. Imagine if both Houses of Congress were controlled by one party and it required only a simple majority to both impeach and convict. The Founding Fathers understood this and imposed a required 67 Senators to vote for conviction and removal from office. One hundred Senators must rely upon this notion of high crimes and misdemeanors. Richard Nixon knew the gig was up when he chose to resign rather than face conviction in the Senate. For those of us who are old enough to remember Watergate from its June 1972 DNC headquarters break-in through Nixon\u2019s August 1974 resignation, it was generally understood that Republican Senators could no longer defend Nixon\u2019s actions. We live in a very different time now. It might be said that in 1974 members of Congress were more noble and ethical compared to today; but probably not. Rather, today Washington is highly partisan; acrimony and polemics rule the day (and night). Hard core Republicans and Democrats know where they stand on the issue of President Trump\u2019s behavior. It will now be up to the independent voters; the ones with still a shred of objectivity in their bones. They will decide in November whether or not Donald Trump should stay or go.",

He believes that everything is a business 'deal' and this is one big game show that he can rig to help himself and others like him.\n\nOf course he is guilty, but so is just about everyone in Washington. Corruption is tolerated as patronage. He is just such an embarrassment that most educated people can't believe he is representing the United States on the world stage. He needs to go.",

Trump broke the law by withholding the aid, it's that simple.\nSecond, it conveniently ignores the hired goons and the conspiracy against a US ambassador and one of our fledgling allies.\nIt ignores the cover-up.\nEverybody with a brain and conscience sees Trump is an impeachable criminal, using the presidency as a cash machine and ego machine.",

The actual distribution of the money was a normal administrative process carried out by OMB--Mullvaney's dept. The money was set to go. That's when Trump stepped in and said, no, don't send it.

What matters is that Trump took action to commit an illegal act - per the impeachment investigation and GAO findings - that resulted in foreign aid being illegally withheld from an ally. The primary flaw is that Blackman assumes Trump, the man, is analogous to Presidents Lincoln and Johnson. That alone is an absurd suggestion as Trump is an astonishingly ignorant human being, lacking both an understanding of history and the mental fitness required to lead. Indeed, what is ignored here is Trump's pattern of behavior. The impeachment investigation came about not just because Trump committed what was clearly an abuse of power, but because he has always been this way, proudly and without reservation. This is a man who has openly praised dictators, sided with Putin on a world stage while critizing his own intelligence agencies, heaped praise upon psychotic tyrants like Kim Jong Il, divided the country with hateful rhetoric, tweeting vitriolic attacks and disproven conspiracy theories, and on and on.  The House responded accordingly because they knew that withholding military funds from an ally was a continuation of the behavior we have seen with Trump for his entire adult life. Let's not pretend we are talking about a man who can share the stage with Lincoln and Johnson. There is no precedent for this \"President.\"",

Mr. Blackman's rationale that actions for \"personal political gain\" are not impeachable entirely misses the point. The President's actions were illegal. He cut off aid, which itself is illegal, and then strong-armed President Zelenski - extorting him to investigate Trump's political rival in order to get the money flowing again. Any opinion that the US Constitution doesn't permit a President to be impeached for such conduct is, at best, ill-informed, and at worst, a sycophant's viewpoint.",

We just can't play with federal policy, military aid, for personal gain. \n\nWe can argue that Hunter Biden was really in a corrupt situation, more corrupt, somehow, than the position of the President's own offspring, and that the situation was not a conspiracy spun out of wishes, trumped up - what a marvelous verb our President is - for expediency. We could argue it, but we'd be wrong.\n\nI am tired of pro-Trump advocates ignoring the underlying facts. It was the extortion using government funds and the cover-up that got Trump impeached.  \n\nThe President has not been impeached for being political, but for being corrupt.",

This was amplified when Trump continued on to publicly excoriate China and Russia to also find political dirt he could use.  His second demand from Ukraine for the DNC server is ludicrous.  This is merely a continuation of his obstruction of the investigation into Russian meddling in our elections to throw the blame on Ukraine.  Putin must be so pleased.

Heck  when Obama was president, Republicans were all up in arms when the IRS targeted conservative religious institutions on taxation (a part of government policy) and called it a political hit job. The bar is soooo much lower in this case. Congress approved tax payers money to support Ukraine's defence as part of US national security strategy, Trump dangled it infront of Ukraine's president and said in paraphrase: \"I will give it to you as soon as you help me get re-elected.\" Aside from obstructing the will of Congress without a legitimate policy justification,  since when do public officials get to use taxpayers money to support their re-elections? If that is ok then the US should get ready to become an authoritarian state with a president in office for life enriching themselves off of the public purse. Congress would become a tool of the president's political and economic power (Senate and House Republicans you are well on your way on that front)....How can Mr Blackman fail to see this?",

The crime-boss innuendo will have been clear, and Z almost delivered.\n\nCoda: Bolton likened Trump's pressure on Zelensky to a \"drug deal,\" telling Fiona Hill to specifically inform White House counsel of his distance.

Post OpEd): \"Trump\u2019s lawyers shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use bogus legal arguments on impeachment\" whose opinion suggests that Alan Dershowitz and this author are not lawyers he'd consider a serious constitutional scholars. Here's an excerpt:\n\nThe argument that only criminal offenses are impeachable has died a thousand deaths in the writings of all the experts on the subject, but it staggers on like a vengeful zombie. In fact, there is no evidence that the phrase \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors\u201d was understood in the 1780s to mean indictable crimes.\n\nOn the contrary, with virtually no federal criminal law in place when the Constitution was written in 1787, any such understanding would have been inconceivable. Moreover, on July 20, 1787, Edmund Randolph, Virginia\u2019s governor, urged the inclusion of an impeachment power specifically because the \u201cExecutive will have great opportunitys of abusing his power.\u201d Even more famously, Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 65 defined \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d as \u201cthose offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\u201d \n\nThe related suggestion that, even if some noncriminal offenses might be impeachable, \u201cabuse of power\u201d is not among them is particularly strange. No serious constitutional scholar has ever agreed with it. The suggestion turns the impeachment power on its head.",

Get a foreign country to smear your opponent and that becomes the narrative during the whole campaign. Why can\u2019t he do that on his own without getting foreign help? What\u2019s next? Saudi, Israel, China?  The day after mueller testimony, he is emboldened to do it again and when people keep saying the mueller report came up empty, it was nothing and no one disputes this on tv, it shows what a short memory we all have.

The \"national security\" risk was losing an election to southern sympathizers, not thinning the ranks of Sherman's juggernaut.\n     The Johnson example is so far from the issue of foreign interference as to be ludicrous...\n     This narrative ignores the illegal hold on Congressionally allocated aid, the lives of Ukrainians fighting a war against our once and future enemy, and the damage to our nations credibility both as a beacon of democracy and as a champion of its best practices. I think we NEED to impeach for this crime, and that 53 GOP senators can find it possible to defend the actions of this loathsome president is the only dangerous precedent being set.",

Of course all politician's consider the political consequences of their actions but what Lincoln and Johnson did in these examples are in no way analogous to what Trump did. Trump conditioned a white house meeting, something only the President can do, on Ukraine announcing investigations into a political rival. He also illegally withheld congressionally approved funds from an ally for the same reason. On top of this he wanted Ukraine to publicly give credence to Russian propaganda. The idea that Trump's actions here are typical or benign is absurd. Sad to see such half baked thinking on the NYT Op-Ed page.",

The issue for me is not whether President Trump is found guilty.  Rather, it is whether Republicans are willing to put aside their small-minded party-centric thinking and acknowledge the danger of a president who is willing to allow a cadre of treacherous people in whom he recklessly places his trust to fill his brain with conspiracy theories and boogeymen in order to manipulate him to engage in actions that are detrimental to our nation.

Now we have people like John Bolton, who no longer works for the president, musing publicly about whether they will 'agree' to comply with a congressional subpoena.

Mr. Trump wanted to learn about potential financial corruption concerning Hunter, realizing that such an investigation would, perhaps, yield greater scrutiny of Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe evidence clearly shows that Trump was not interested in *learning* anything. The demand on Zelinsky was not an investigation: it was the *public announcement* of an investigation, specifically on CNN and drafted by Trump's minions. There was zero national interest in such an announcement and 100% personal interest. That is plain abuse of power.\n\nAs for analysis: *of course* what Trump did was not illegal! It was an *abuse of power*, which means he was using the power legally invested in the office for corrupt purposes. The trial is not a criminal trial, and the worst punishment is just loss of a job, not a fine or jail. So even bringing the question of legality into the discussion is pure spin and deflection. It would be *legal* for Trump to issue pardons to all his friends and nobody else. But it would be corrupt and impeachable.\n\nWas Trump motivated by considerations of personal interest and not national good, and did the act only serve his personal interest and not the national good.

Most, however, perceive the noises they make offensive, both to truth and justice alike.\n\nBehaviorally, the Ever Trumper cannot stand alone, congregating in clusters of unidirectional assertions. Interestingly, if an individual strays, often it is summarily \"fired\", a sight not seen, but observed by means of a \"royal tweet\". \n\nAdditionally, they appear when called upon to emerge, parroting what they have been told; their gift of mimicry considered exceptional among savvy sycophants. \n\nConsuming the goodwill of others and the public trust, Ever Trumpers know no shame. Guided by their curious sense of being offended by any who challenge their sense of privilege or entitlement, they seek out common venues to relieve themselves. \n\nRecently, consequent to unusual impeachment weather, Ever Trumpers have appeared with greater frequency, particularly among the visual and print media. \n\nOne expert's suggestion of how to handle this phenomena is to place newspaper randomly on the ground so the Ever Trumper may guided to deposit their message, rather than spreading it everywhere. The irony, however, is not lost on those who publish. \n\nFinally, do not seek the Ever Trumper. Unfriendly to all but their own kind, hostility often meets such efforts.",

            "comment_body": "Sorry Mr. Blackman, but you don't get to cherry pick the facts you want to present, then call your conclusion persuasive. Mr. Trump's attempt to bribe (or extort, or coerce, they all fit) the incoming Ukrainian president- in the meantime, holding up military aid as a threat- in order to announce an investigation into the Bidens, for NO OTHER reason than his own political benefit is an abuse of power, and clearly rises to the level of impeachable conduct. And don't even try to give me that \"concern about corruption\" canard.   Moreover, the two articles of impeachment sent over to the Senate represent only a fraction of the impeachable conduct that could have been leveled against this despicable demagogue. Conflicts of interest from day one of his presidency because he refused to divest his holdings, immediate violations of the emoluments clause- the list is truly staggering, and I've not done justice to the totality of his corrupt behavior by listing only these examples. Finally, trying to equate these proceedings to a vote of \"no confidence\" in parliamentary governments is ludicrous on its face. \n\nWe do, however, agree on one thing. The final judgment will be rendered by the American voting public at the ballot box this November. Lincoln famous phrase is cogent here. Trump's vaunted base is fooled all of the time. The rest of the public isn't even fooled some of the time anymore. And the verdict will be rendered November 3, 2020.",

It's not that Trump simply requested the head of a foreign government to perform a domestic political task for Trump's personal interest.  It's that he did so by a) using public money -- that's *your* money and *my* money -- to provide leverage in the request. He did so illegally, as the GAO ruled.  And not only did he illegally re-purpose our money for his private gain, but he did so in a manner that threatened our national security, threatened the lives of Ukrainian citizens and the security of that state, and abetted the goals of one of our international foes.\n\nThere has been no contest on any of this by Trump or his abettors.  Why this is so hard to understand -- and why some Americans fail to see the outrageous gangsterism of this act -- is beyond me.  Given the shallowness of the author's argument, I'm a little surprised too that the Times chose to publish it.  Is this the best argument they could muster up?  Maybe so!",

Rather, most of the comments are repetitions of ill-informed talking points. \n\nThe reality: no money was withheld beyond the time period specified by Congress so a \"withholding\" claim is baseless and silly. There is no evidence -- none -- about  what was in Trump's mind during his conversations with the President of Ukraine so there no evidence (just breathless supposition) of whether Trump sought the investigation of Biden's son for \"personal gain\" or because exposing corruption is a good idea. Maybe it was both. Who knows?\n\nThe \"Obstruction of Congress\" is nothing more than the normal rejection of Congressional meddling in Executive Branch decision-making, similar to the positions taken by all prior Presidents of both parties.  The Democrats could have (should have?) gone the normal route of seeking a Court order for dragging Executive Branch officials before Congress.  The fact that they didn't speaks volumes about the weakness of the \"obstruction\" charge.\n\nThe irony is that impeachment debacle is likely to strengthen Trump's appeal (or more accurately enhance public distaste for Democrats) and might be enough to get him re-elected and tip the House back to Republican. This is an undeserved gift to Trump.",

Trump broke the law by withholding them, as the GAO has now told as, and as his administration was repeatedly advised the hold would do. Therefore, Trump also violated the \u201cTake Care\u201d Clause of the Constitution.\n\nThere was no legitimate government purpose in withholding the aid.  The \u201cdo us a favor\u201d in Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, a/k/a the quid pro quo, was looking into Biden, not corruption.  And, as the witnesses testified, Trump did not even want an actual investigation.  He just wanted Ukraine to announce one.  His purpose was to dirty up his political opponent, nothing else.\n\nAnd, this piece ignores the obstruction article of impeachment. If Trump\u2019s conduct was nothing but consideration of politics in connection with lawful government policy, why the embargo on documents and witnesses who supposedly could exculpate him? Does the fact that Mr. Blackman does not address Trump\u2019s directing witnesses not to even show up mean he cannot defend that conduct?

Trump was seeking a \"thing of value\" from Ukraine and to get it, he was illegally willing to withhold millions of dollars of military aid approved by Congress to get it. He was willing to have his henchmen threaten a 30+ year foreign service officer - Ambassador Yavonavitch, And we know he's willing to lie with abandon daily to keep up the charade. \n\nFor you, a law professor, to hoist this serious illegal and illiberal conduct on to the American people as if it's legit is in itself a sham.

And if the Senate would allow witnesses, would almost certainly prove it was only released after the President got caught by a whistleblower complaint that was also illegally withheld from Congress.  Second, he did not just do this for \"personal gain\". His attempt was to basically disenfranchise the 60% of voters who would likely vote against him in the next election. Why does the GOP continue to whine about disenfranchising Trump voters when the President's entire strategy was to create chaos in the early stages of 2020 to set him up for another smear campaign against his opponent. Do that on your own dime Mrt President, not by holding up funding that was approved by a Congress that represents all Americans, not just your voters.

And if it helped Trump get reelected?  Oh, he'd most certainly get more \"money and property.\"  He's got emoluments running amok!  \n\nAnd these examples from the Lincoln and LBJ presidencies?  This is some soggy oatmeal, professor.  Lincoln - the commander in chief - encouraged his soldiers to exercise a sacred civic duty.  LBJ merely filled a cabinet vacancy, as is his constitutional duty and privilege.  Neither of these acts comes close to amounting to the abject and criminal shakedown attempted by Trump.  \n\n1.

He just wanted an announcement that Ukraine was investigating Crowdstrike and the Bidens. Crowdstrike is about an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine that interfered with the 2016 election, not Russia. And Joe Biden actually got a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor fired. A replacement might have put more focus on Burisma. Trump called that same corrupt prosecutor a good guy.\n\nTrump never brings up corruption in his April call with Zelensky nor in their July 25th call. If Trump was so concerned about corruption, then why go through this in a roundabout way through Rudy Giuliani\u2019s \u201cdrug deal\u201d? Why not deal with it straightforwardly perhaps via the NSC? Why the secrecy and no explanation around the holdup in military aid? Why rag on Ambassador Yovanovitch and recall her with no cause? Because this would have gotten in the way of Trump\u2019s own corruption!\n\nThis was a naked abuse of power by Trump for his own political gain, and he is being rightfully impeached for it.",

Even on its surface, it looks like Mr. Biden has way more to fear from Ukraine than Mr. Trump ever did from Russia.  We should be thanking Mr. Trump for bringing this to light rather than impeaching him.",

No, \"hoping\" is not the right word since I truly believe Trump is a terrible president and that he is a great danger to democracy in the USA and in the world.\n\nNo, I hoped someone that support Trump could come up with a believable argument for why they do. This was not it. Yes, sure, politicians have always maneuvered in such a  way that they get an advantage. Many of those maneuvers are borderline criminal but basically all professionals use the rule book to their advantage. A tennis player will try to put his ball as close to the line as possible. A racing driver will use every inch of the track.\n\nMr. Blackman writes: \"Receiving a \u201cpolitical benefit\u201d does not transform an otherwise legal action (like requesting an investigation) into an abuse of power\"\n\nThat's how he describes what Trump did. Sure, if that Trump only had called up Zelensky and said, \"Hey, can you look into Biden for me?\" I could agree with Mr. Blackman. It would have been an ugly move, but it wouldn't have crossed the line.\n\nBut that is not what happened. Trump used the full power of his country to extort the President of Ukraine. He let Mr. Zelensky know that unless he would be \"receiving a political benefit\" Ukraine would not get the hundreds of millions they where counting on and there would be no official recognition of its new president. He did it secretly.\n\nThe US Diplomats that did not want to play his game was sent home.",

By 1864, fourteen northern states had already enacted field-balloting laws. Among the handful that hadn't, Indiana was one. Letting the soldiers return to fulfill their inalienable right to vote\u2014even if the results would benefit Lincoln\u2014does not in slightest way compare to what we are considering today, namely, that a U.S. President withheld public funds simply to attempt to smear a political rival.

I shudder to think what you teach in your law school classes as it certainly is not American Constitutional Law.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly conceded Trump's malfeasance, yet argue he was purportedly only guilty of attempted crimes, so he's innocent. Like you, they also assert Trump was trying to expose corruption when this has repeatedly been proven a lie. A law professor teaching students using debunked conspiracy theories as facts is horrific. It is the disinformation North Korea uses in its state run schools.\n\nTrump committed \"High Crimes\". It is term of art from the 18th century referring to political corruption as that corruption is the impeachable offense. Only in a post-factual world are Trump's attempts not crimes. Such reasoning means defendants cannot be charged if they repeatedly stab someone yet they survive. \n\nTrump illegally withheld money Congress gave Ukraine for its defense against Russia. He did so to bribe, extort, and pressure Ukrainian President Zelensky to publicly announce an investigation based on a debunked conspiracy theory about Joe Biden. Trump did not care if Zelensky held an investigation, only that a foreign power interfere in our upcoming elections to rig it in his favor. He paid for it with taxpayer money, while illegally usurping Congress's authority.\n\nThe Founders gave Congress, not the Executive, the Power of The Purse to prevent a thoroughly corrupt Executive like Trump from destroying our Republic.",

Contrary to Prof. Blackman's argument, Trump plainly, openly committed statutory and common law bribery and Hobbs Act extortion. \n    The evidence showed Trump personally, illegally withheld transfer of congressionally appropriated military aid for Ukraine, an ally under attack. Trump did so to induce Ukraine to perform the political favor of announcing a probe of his rival Biden in exchange for giving the aid Trump had no right to withhold. Trump personally told Ukraine's president he wanted this \"favor\" in direct response to a plea for anti-tank missiles to repel Russian invaders.  \n    The mountain of evidence would be even higher if not for the conduct supporting the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress.  Refusing all congressional subpoenas on a spurious claim of \"absolute privilege\" is also a pungent abuse of power.  And now, the Trump-dominated Senate refuses to even hear evidence?\n   This simply isn't politics as usual.",

Here, we can conclude that trump is withholding documents and witnesses because that evidence will reveal he committed the wrongs he is accused of and possibly more. Remember, this is a person legitimately and credibly accused of systematic cheating in his taxes, abusing creditors, mistreating renters and breaking the law in doing so, cheating on his wife, covering it up and breaking the law in doing so. Trump is no choirboy. His whole life has been one of scheming and getting away with wrongdoing. He is not behaving like a politician. He is behaving like himself - a person with a history of wrongdoing continuing to commit wrongs. And his withholding of aid has been found to have broken the law by a neutral arbiter.

And perhaps most importantly, they knew the difference between right and wrong.  \n\nThe republicans of 2020 are now beholden to a \u2018republican\u2019 president that represents evil, cloaks himself in lies and deception, and intentionally divides the nation and the world to better his re-election odds.  This is his modus operandi.  He needed help to win in 2016, and he knows he cannot win without it in 2020.  \n\nMy own father - a republican for life voter - has even acknowledged he believes Donald J Trump is immoral.  I never thought our Christian nation could elect and continue to support an immoral man.  And yet... here we are three years later.  \n\nThe only course of action is to remove the cancer from our nation.  Cut off this deadly disease of disinformation and corruption before we lose everything we represent to the world.  \n\nAnd finally, what about your eternal souls?

Speaker Pelosi told Trump that all roads lead to Putin with him.

Mueller was prevented from investigating Trump\u2019s finances by Rod Rosenstein, and William Barr terminated the investigation prematurely. \nFor further information on the Russian conspiracy, see The Moscow Project <a href=\"https://themoscowproject.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://themoscowproject.org</a>/ and The Asset Podcast <a href=\"https://theassetpodcast.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://theassetpodcast.org</a>. \nRemarkably, virtually the entire Republican delegation in Congress is in complete denial of all of this. \nThe GOP has become the Gang of Putin!",

He just wants to hire the Ukraine to run a Russia style misinformation campaign to weaken his top political opponent. Blackman makes it seem like Trump was pursuing a legitimate corruption investigation that just happened to benefit him.  He was not.  3.  He also fired Ambassador to the Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch to help him get away with his scheme. Blackman doesn't mention this either.  Leaving out such information paints a false picture of the events.  So this article is in NO WAY a rebuttal of the charges against Trump, which Blackman fails to articulate.  This article falls well short of the standards of the NYTimes. In a flippant attempt at seeming balanced, the Times propagates misinformation.",

That is precisely the wielding of great power for personal benefit the founders had in mind with \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"   It need not be an ordinary crime because in this case only one person can commit the crime: the one entrusted with the Presidency.  Of course such crimes are not going to be traceable back to standard legal statutes that apply to the rest of us.  The rest of us are not the President and so cannot commit such high crimes.  We are not \"high\" enough to do them.  Trump is.  And he did.  The argument here in this Op-Ed is strained at best.",

He cannot tell the executive branch to ignore lawful subpoenas from Congress. That is the larger high crime here. We have checks and balances in our government to keep the executive branch, but the President specifically, from acting counter to national interests.

That foreign country agreed and signed a deal which the president didn\u2019t send to congress as required, declared a peace victory in a heroic media blitz and flew the cash to the country.  Clearly bribery for his own personal gain.\n\nWhat I\u2019m doing is taking a perfectly acceptable (at least deemed acceptable by the American media) deal by President Obama with Iran and framing it in such a way that it surely seems quid pro quo, actually criminal bribery, in order to make a deal to benefit himself.    My point is that Trumps actions are being spun in the same ridiculous way I spun the Iranian deal.    Both Obama and Trumps,actions were inappropriate,  The difference is that the media believes Obama is god and Trump is the antichrist but in reality all politicians do these things.",

That is not within his power. It is a crime (see the GAO finding).  And holding back aid to a country which is in an active shooting war with an adversary of our country is immoral, and against the national interest.  When that action is done in exchange for a domestic political favor there is in fact something VERY wrong with it. \n\nThe argument that this is not a big deal is ridiculous. What if instead of holding up aid the President had offered to remove troops from South Korea, or stop funding NATO, or turned off our middle defense capabilities? \n\nIt\u2019s so disheartening to see men and women of intellect and success contorting themselves in order to fit the tortured logic of this president and to prostrate themselves before him.",

Now he has done a 180 and seemingly offers his Sgt Schultz excuse \"I know nothing\" as his defense for what he said in '99. Shameful. As to Josh Blackman's piece I say this professor...Asking another country to investigate the person you assume will be your chief rival in the next election literally minutes after that person announced is inviting foreign gov'ts to partake in our elections. Using aid badly needed as a lever endangers our sovereignty even more. Trump wasn't impeached and now in trial because he's told umpteen numbers of lies and outright fabrications. That is up to the electorate. It's his denials of involving foreign nations in our electoral process and the lies he has told about those events coupled with the facts that he engaged non gov't \"surrogates\" with no authority and or negotiating power to do so on his behalf in a plot to subvert the process. And if you think the Democratic House has launched this \"no confidence\" morphing of the impeachment articles you obviously forget what Republicans (and I am one and lived for years in Texas) did in investigating Bill Clinton for EVERYTHING!",

That in itself is a corrupt abuse of presidential power.\n\nFurther, that Congress was frustrated in its ability to exercise its constitutional duty of oversight, by the President, who refused to turn over documents or witnesses, to Congress, is evidence of obstruction.

It is deceitful to the reader to suggest this, and he does us all a disservice in doing so.\n\nThe framers very much had the King George the third in mind when framing the constitution.

They feared an unscrupulous President who may use the tremendous power of his office to advance his own personal objectives, including reelection.  Noah Feldman in his speech to the judiciary committee states this in a clear and coherent manner so please reference that in support of this argument. \n\nBy withholding assistance from the Ukrainian, Trump emboldens Russian aggression and undermines US National Security.

One would be na\u00efve to suppose that such a request by Trump would have been disinterested, but, even so, the request would have had a colorable public benefit, namely, discovering corruption, if it existed. There was no colorable public benefit, however, in extorting President Zelensky to publicly announce an investigation of Burisma and the 2016 election. There was only a personal political benefit to Trump. Recall that Trump, through the letter he finagled from Rosenstein, justified his firing of Comey on the ground that Comey had violated a longstanding Justice Department policy against the public disclosure of politically sensitive investigations. What Trump did was essentially no different than if he had told North Carolina after a hurricane, \"I'm going to withhold disaster relief until you run a campaign ad smearing my political opponent.\"",

The power of the American Presidency in both conditionally offering an Oval Office visit to a new head of state, and in conditionally managing American military assistance.  The condition?  \u201cGive me dirt on my key political opponent.\u201d   Second, when the abuse was uncovered, Mr. Trump tried to cover up the offense.  In another unprecedented move, he instructed his administration to refuse to cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry. I\u2019m curious Mr. Blackman... which other American President has done the same thing, to the same extraordinary degree?  You are right that this trial could establish a dangerous precedent.

Then, the day after the Mueller presentation, an emboldened Trump i proceeded on his plan to extort Ukraine and undermine our foreign service who were actually fighting corruption, our national security interests and our foreign policy.  \n\nSo,  Professor Blackman based on your examples and argument, please follow through and tell us why this could be in our national interests.  \n\nRegarding the 2020 elections.  Unfortunately our faith in the integrity of our elections were shattered in 2016 and all the evidence is that Republicans and Trump will do anything in 2020, even cheat, to win and maintain minority control and power.",

Maliciously re-framing the situation as \"investigating a political rival\" does not disclose the entire set of events and masks the acceptable reasoning behind the issue.  I've seen people provide a litany of mischaracterizations in an effort to support the assertion that Trump could not have possibly had any reason other than simply \"getting\" Biden, but those amount to personal (and biased) opinions, not facts.  The fact this continued Democrat deceit ignores is Trump has stated since before he was elected the US spends too much on foreign aid, other countries should spend more (or to use the favorite progressive phrase, pay \"their fair share\"), and has indeed undertaken actions to reduce foreign spending of US funds.  This Ukraine deal aligns with that philosophy and, despite the outrage against Trump and all the mean things he says and non-progressive attitudes he has, does not create even the shadow of an impeachable event.",

Andrew Johnson was impeached, as history would note, predominantly for the 10th article against him which charged having \"made 'with a loud voice... intemperate, inflammatory and scandalous harangues and ... utter loud threats and bitter menaces...\" (CRS Report For Congress, September 1998)  Here is one area for which the current President could be impeached.  Others include refusing to divest his personal holdings; the appearance of maladministration for violating the emoluments clause; and for utterly disregarding the Constitution and the powers given in it to the Legislative branch, not to mention co-opting the Judicial branch for his own use.  It is true that a President should not be impeached for being a politician.  This is not a case that is so cut and dry.

The whole scheme was inconsistent with the President's duty to exercise his assigned policy functions in the national, not his own, interest. Your analogies are based on examples of mixed motives where a personal benefit and the national interest happen to coincide. They are inapposite on the facts because here there was only a personal interest that also undermined the national interest. You are also wrong on the law, as the great weight of scholarly opinion agrees. Hamilton made this clear in his \"whirlwind\" letter to Washington, and Federalist Paper references to impeachment confirm it.

Perhaps a Presidential action that has tangential political benefit might be acceptable, if it is also a reasonable effort to pursue the legitimate public interest duties of the presidency.  But when it is decidedly NOT in the public interest, and the sole effect is a political benefit...\n\nBasically, the label of \"bribery\" (which is specifically mentioned in the Constitution as grounds for impeachment) seems accurate as a characterization of Trump's actions towards the Ukraine. The articles of impeachment might better have used the term \"bribery\", although \"abuse of power\" seems sufficient and covers more aspects of the administration's misconduct. \n\nFinally, there is an important distinction between policies that are \"insufficiently publicly spirited' and policies contrary to the public interest and having little or no motivation other than personal political benefit. Blackman's final paragraph avoids this distinction.  \n\nFor an illustration paralleling Blackman's final paragraph, we might say that it isn't criminal for one person to inconvenience another, but what if the \"inconvenience\" is murder?  The distinction is important.",

Perhaps Trump's random and unsupportable decisions in foreign policy that have served to alienate America's long-time allies in the world would cary some weight.

The impeachable crime was a violation of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 that was designed to prevent a president from acting against the will of Congress and was codified after Nixon had similarly acted to withhold funds for programs based on his personal opposition to them.

With this article, he argues that for example other presidents have used actions for political gain, that 'all politicians do that'. What he leaves out is the nuance, that actions that have political benefit are okay as long as there are other benefits to the country. When a politician gives out pork, when they make legislation people want, they gain favor, but are doing so in the scope of their job. On the other hand, Nixon using the IRS to go after political enemies was not legal.Johnson had every right to appoint Ramsay attorney general, and if his father resigned (rather than recuse himself from cases the DOJ brought in front of them), that was of benefit. Appointing Marshall was not illegal, it had political benefits, but it also was not only about poilitics (if that were actionable, then Trump should be impeached for Kavanaugh).

He then marched through Georgia, illustrating the weakened military position of the South in late 1864. \n\nAlex Wohl, an author who has studied the careers of Tom Clark and his son, has opined that Tom stepped down from the bench so that his son could be named AG. That Thurgood Marshall was named to the bench seems to be a by-product, and not a cause, of Justice Clark stepping down. \n\nHardly seems reasonable to make moral equivalencies between Lincoln and Johnson, on the one hand, versus Trump on the other. To emulate Adam Schiff, I wouldn't say Prof Blackman was trying to mislead; rather, I would say he is misinformed.",

If that were in fact what happened and the Bidens became ensnared in the process to the president\u2019s benefit, I would tend to agree that the political benefit is ancillary to a legitimate policy goal.

Because he will enlist the help of Russia to win (if he hasn't already.) Trump should have been removed from office because he used Russia to help him win the election in 2016. Secondly, assuming asking for a personal political favor from Ukraine is not an abuse of power, a point I also disagree with, Trump abused his power by blocking the investigation and should be removed from office for that. But because all the Republicans are in lockstep with his wishes and are a majority in all branches that count, he will remain unaccountable for all of his actions. That does not mean he should not be removed from office. It means he will not be removed. We will not have a fair election in 2020. Trump will hire Russia to help him again.

It is illegal for the President to hold up duly approved aid without the knowledge and approval of Congress. So, the two key components of his misdeeds were in fact illegal. Taken together, they constitute failing to take an official action in order to gain a personal or political benefit -- which is the definition of bribery and clearly an abuse of power. \n2. Yes, politicians consider the politics of the actions they take. The special trust that we put in the president is that he put the country ahead of the politics. If Trump pursues something that benefited the country, it is not a problem that he also benefits politically. In this case, however, he put his benefit at odds with the country's interests, and that is not acceptable. \n3. When a president is attempting to illegally and unethically interfere with an election -- the most important component of a democracy and a process which we the people must trust in order for this experiment to work -- it is indeed time for a \"Constitutional parachute.\" The advice to settle this at the ballot box is meaningless when the ballot box itself is the subject of the misdeeds.",

And the VP had great influence given the military support of the US as leverage on whether or not Burisma would investigated by the Ukraine government. \n  So here is Joe Biden running for the Democratic nomination for President for 2020, and starting that run just after his son quits Burisma. What if Joe Biden was not running for President ? Would there be the same allegation of trying to harm a potential political or a real political rival ? Yet, the cozy relationship of Hunter's appointment to the Burisma board was still a fact and with all the money given to him over 5 years, something that should be investigated. Americans employed abroad should be held to US standards of conduct. \n   President Trump asking for help from the Ukraine leader is logical. Is it his fault that Joe Biden decided to run for the nomination of his party ? The real conflict of interest was appointing the son of the Vice-President to the board.",

Third, the POTUS does not have the authority to hold congressionally appropriated funds or condition them unless authorized by Congress to do so. The purpose of the trial is to determine if all of this warrants removal. It may not. But surely it is not as clear-cut as this author would have you believe.",

The fact that he withheld it was unlawful (see recent GAO determination to that effect).  This was inviting a foreign power to interfere in our elections (see Russian interference in 2016 which all agree Trump did not oppose).  Would Mr. Blackman argue that it's OK for Ukraine to help Trump get reelected?  \n\nWhat Lincoln and Johnson did was sleazy, it did not rise to the level that the framers thought was a corruption of the office and specifically did not involve asking for foreign help in staying in office.  Trump's actions were precisely  those that the framers wanted to prevent.

In fact, Lincoln worked to keep foreign influence out of US politics - if he had not succeded, the Confederacy might have won  independence. And re Johnson, the US was (and is) not like a Ukraine needing support of another power for its territorial integrity. Which foreign power was Johnson to draw into his nonetheless despicable scheme?\n\n2) There are legal, official ways of getting an investigation done and, using these, an investigation could have been started years ago. President Trump chose to move outside of the processes for pursuing such investigations. He used a man (Guilliani) to lead the effort who is not part of the government. That seems to be an effort to keep his  communications out of the official record. Why?",

The abuse involves withholding appropriated funds for sanctioned foreign-policy objectives, and leveraging withheld funds to advance an extortionist scheme designed for purely personal benefit.  The abuse also involves pursuing the extortionist scheme via a rogue emissary operating without any govt oversight, directly authorized by the president for his personal gain.  One could also argue that rejecting all intelligence on 2016 election interference to pursue the self-interested conspiracy theory of Ukrainian responsibility also constitutes abuse of presidential power, but then \"Fox & Friends\" would have to be charged as co-conspirators.",

This blind spot among scholars who mingle the personal private interest in being elected president with the execution on the office itself is a grave error in legal analysis.

As for obstruction of Congress, that is silly, as almost every president starting with Washington has asserted that privilege, and nobody has been impeached for doing so.  Plus, Trump has been unusually transparent, and at the same time has been hit with an unprecedented barrage of congressional subpoenas.\n\nIf you know from the inside about how Speaker Pelosi operates, this is her show.  Manager Schiff is only a sycophantic pompous priss who is really managed by Pelosi.  \n\nUnfortunately for the Dems, Pelosi has lost her edge.

If it was a national security concern that the son of the Vice President was getting enormous sums to do a job for which he had no experience than it's absolutely the President's duty to demand an investigation and withhold aid until such an investigation proceeds. Doesn't Biden getting an investigator fired also raise a security issue?\n\nHunter and John Kerry's son-in-law started an investment firm which quickly amassed a billion dollars in assets.  Even if they did not propose investigating gave access to the administration, the mere appearance of it warrants an investigation.\n\nEither investigation could demonstrate no wrong-doing. Irrelevant. The issue is whether Trump was warranted in demanding it.\n\nSecond, it must always be illegal to investigate anyone who might run in an election opposing you. Yes, Joe is running for President but granting him immunity because he is running causes the stalemate Israel has with Bibi's corruption indictment. The argument he sought to investigate his opponent, opens a can of worms.  You get  immunity simply because you choose to run for President?

Motive is everything.\n\nFunny how conservatives cherry-pick history for bad examples of Trump-like behavior. Now, Trump is like Lincoln for they both arranged things in a \u201cpolitical\u201d manner. I anxiously await Professor Blackman\u2019s next article on how encouraging soldiers to vote is a virtue while encouraging minorities to vote is not.",

Johnson as president has the right to nominate anyone he wished as attorney general, no matter the motive.

That would have been perfectly proper and would have involved no need to hold up money that was already appropriated for the defense of a country under attack by Trump's friend, Vladimir Putin.  Professor Blackman, the fact that Trump had the best investigators in the world at his disposal and decided not to use them shows that he did not want anyone actually investigated.  And, since that's true, your argument that there is some quasi-legitimate purpose in the \"ask\" falls apart.  There was never any reason at all to ask the new Ukrainian President to investigate anyone. \n\nTrump will not be thrown out of office, and lame arguments like this will be sited by Republican's as justification.

By decoupling the request for an investigation, from the withholding of Congressionally approved funding, the author hints that the President was harmlessly curious about the Bidens.\n\nHere is the problem with that argument.  The President used a non-government attorney to negotiate with a foreign power, while withholding aid that our representatives in Congress had approved, for (a) his own political benefit; and (2) for the benefit of a foreign adversary--Russia.  The investigation included validating Russian propaganda that Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in our election.  \n\nAnd, let's add into the mix the private attorney. A private attorney is bound to act in the best interest of Trump, individually, and not in the United States' best interest.  The attorney is not subject to public disclosure laws.  That is just the start.  It is also illegal (ask General Flynn).  \n\nHowever, by decoupling Trump's curiosity from the threat on funding, and keeping Russia and Giuliani out of the mix, the author makes Trump's actions look harmless.

Yet, it benefitted the people. Trump's actions derived no potential benefit to anyone but himself. In fact, he used taxpayer funded military assistance dollars -- funding that had been approved by representatives (Congress, who are actually elected by majority vote vs. the Electoral College, and thus directly represent the will of the people).

Let's suppose that Trump's behavior with the Ukraine was totally defensible (which it isn't). Congress still has the right and the duty to investigate, to check the power of the executive branch when the latter's actions are suspicious. Trump not only refused to cooperate in this process but insulted and derided anyone who had the nerve to question what he did.\n\nNo one likes to be under this sort of scrutiny. However, if Trump understood and accepted the checks and balances that have kept our government stable since its inception, he would have cooperated. And, to those who complain that the impeachment investigation has interfered with Congress engaging in its other business, note how much more quickly everything could have been handled had Trump not obstructed. \n\nTo me, this second article is as serious as the first because Trump's action promotes giving the executive branch unchecked power - a very dangerous precedent. Still, the first article is incredibly important as well because inviting foreign powers to undermine our elections renders them meaningless. Herein lies the recipe for dictatorship. Such abuse of power cannot be ignored.",

In other words, it is alleged that he didn't want an investigation, rather he wanted damaging information on the Bidens, whether fabricated or not, and, short of the whistleblower, would likely have continued to withhold aid until he got it.

You act as if Trump merely inquired about dirt on Hunter Biden, but he did so much more.  He withheld Congressionally-appropriated military aid, using hundreds of millions of our taxpayer funds as leverage.  The very day after he had finally gotten past the 2016 investigation and Mueller\u2019s final testimony, based on a defense of NO collusion, here\u2019s what we see:  YES collusion.  Rather than chastened by his earlier experience, Trump has renewed brazenness and a firmer conviction he can get away with anything.  As one prescient Iowa Republican thereafter asked Joni Ernst, \u201cWhere is the line?\u201d\n\nLincoln did not use taxpayer funds to pay for the Indiana voters to go home to vote.  Johnson\u2019s mere hope that Clark might step down is nothing like the transcript of Trump\u2019s call to Zelensky, which reads like a page out of The Godfather script.  Nor did either involve foreign interference, which is a crucial distinction.  U.S. presidential campaigns have grown to where candidates now spend $1B or more (a huge increase).  But that entire total is small potatoes to a foreign country trying to influence who gets elected as our President.  A country\u2019s funds can dwarf all other political contributions combined.  We should all be able to agree it is simply wrong for a politician to take a foreign country\u2019s money or in-kind assistance, since they will expect things in return.",

DOD had already conducted their own review, and had determined that Ukraine had met defined anti-corruption requirements for the release of aid.\n\n4) Trump should have kept the State Department in the loop and employed above-board channels, and he should not have publicly disparaged and threatened Ambassador Yovanovitch.\n\n5) Trump should not have hidden records of his interactions in this case to high-security White House servers intended for far more sensitive materials.\n\nOf course, all this ignores the charges against Trump for obvious obstruction of Congress.",

If all President Trump had done was withhold an Oval Office visit awaiting his \"favor\" you might almost have persuaded me that he shouldn't be impeached and convicted for this (I regret that there was never a move for impeachment based on the instances of obstruction of justice detailed in the Mueller report). But, he also used the withholding of Congressionally mandated aid to Ukraine to try to bend the Ukrainians to his will- just a few days ago ruled as illegal by the GAO- and the fact that he ordered its release when his actions were made public is no more exculpatory than if I stuck a gun in a bank teller's face and demanded money, but then had the gun knocked out of my hands by an alert customer behind me.\n\nStepping aside from the law, I greatly fear the liberties an acquitted and re-elected President Trump will take and the diminished capacity of any institutions that would be able to check him.

He illegally solicited a thing of value (it doesn't have to be money or property) from a foreign entity to aid his re-election campaign. Along the way he obstructed Congress as no President has before, he undermined our national security, threatened an ally, undermined our diplomats, threatened federal employees, and harassed a private U.S. citizen. \n\nAll of this for Trump 2020.",

Some are dual intent actions, and that bears investigation. What is the primary intent? Here, the allegation is not that Trump wanted Ukraine to actually DO an investigation of Burisma and Biden, but rather, to ANNOUNCE an investigation. The truth of the matter seems not to have become relevant until after the whistle was blown. This leads me to believe that the intent was purely for personal gain. \n\nWhere the Democrats blew it, in my humble lawyer opinion, was that the muddled presentation of the \u201cconstitutional scholars\u201d did not present a clear legal standard against which to judge Trump\u2019s conduct.

That's not an impeachable offense.\" This is untrue as it assumes politicians, as a matter of course, break laws and use public money to spear opponents at the peril of allies and then obstruct investigations into their conduct. \n\nLet's not normalize this behavior.

His personal interest in getting re-elected may even be his prime motivation (he may not care a whit about Soleimani personally), but his actions carry out what he believes to be in the public interest in order to get re-elected. If we, in turn, believe America is improved by having killed Soleimani, we will re-elect him.\n\nPresident Trump, however, is accused of exercising his powers merely to smear a political opponent. America cannot be reasonably considered better off as a result of the announcement of an investigation into a US citizen by an historically-corrupt foreign government, the House of Representatives majority asserts.\n\nThe key distinction is that power is exercised within the public trust if it furthers, in the eyes of the president, American interests and, *therefore*, re-election chances improve, but not if it furthers *only* re-election chances as a direct result. It may not always be a clear line, but if the facts as alleged by the House of Representatives are true, this case falls clearly on the abuse side.",

President Nixon, who similarly believed during the time of the war in Vietnam that his re-election was in the best interest of the nation, had his minions burglarize his opponent\u2019s headquarters. He was on the verge of impeachment, but resigned first. There are clear and obvious differences in these examples and it is clear which of these Trump\u2019s actions parallel. As for Lyndon Johnson, he may, as the author writes, have wished for the opportunity to nominate Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court, and have thought it good policy and good for his re-election chances, but he did not commit a crime to carry it out.

There are many direct and indirect material benefits for Trump from winning re-election. These include the obvious - ranging from salary, even if he opts to refuse it, to travel expenses to his golf courses, to free meals. Continued presidency also materially benefits the president by giving him a not insignificant protection from financial and other legal harm, including immunity to many legal actions and unique opportunities to interfere with legal discovery.  Four more years of presidency will also be four more years that the president can opt to engage in much more profitable legally and/or ethically dubious actions, such as violation of the emoluments clause, having the ability to directly or indirectly benefit from being able to manipulate the stock markets by twitter trade action pronouncements, and countless other ways that might only be fully clear many years from now after the legal smoke screen provided by this president\u2019s use of every avenue to avoid scrutiny has lifted.",

That's the missing ingredient, one that, remarkably, the author fails to mention.  And it's surely a more risky, cavalier and directly self-serving action than allowing a few Hoosier soldiers to vote in the 1864 presidential election.  One other point: unlike Lincoln, Trump has engaged in a variety of additional activities that independently could lead to impeachment.  They are not directly referenced in the two articles of impeachment, a legitimate political decision which, rather than creating the type of precedent the writer fears, simply will underline to future generations the bottom line--that a person of Trump's character, instincts and many line-crossing behaviors should never be president, regardless of party or perceived justified ends.",

That any of the politicians equate political gain from a re-election by the people with impeachable personal gain should be surprising, but the media and academics are saying this too.  \n\nPerhaps actions completely unrelated to performing the duties of office could be argued to be removed from the operation of democracy, but seeking an inquiry into possible malfeasance by another office holder, without trying to corrupt the outcome of the inquiry, by an entity with lawful jurisdiction over the matter, that can be regarded as independent, and whose investigative work could be criticized later and debated in the context of an electoral process, is closely related to performing the duties of the office.  Many voters would want this action to be taken, and would want to be free to consider the outcome of the investigation and any criticisms of it.

In fact, Johnson risked political suicide by alienating his fellow Southern Democrats.  Professor Blackman also doesn't take into consideration the facts on the ground in 1864 when he breathlessly argues that Union soldiers in the western theater of the Civil War faced greater dangers as the result of some of their comrades being furloughed in order to vote at home.  In early September Sherman was able to pronounce that \"Atlanta is ours and fairly won\" (John Bell Hood would complete the destruction of secessionist hopes in the west by impaling his remaining forces on Union fortifications at Franklin by the end of November) and had commenced his march through Georgia where he was supremely confident he would \"make the South howl.\"",

The facts are clear: Trump only cared that an investigation of Biden be publicized (not refuted by Trump), he did not follow normal channels for coordinating a criminal investigation with a foreign nation (not refuted by Trump), he sought to keep his \"perfect call\" with Zelensky secret by storing the records on a confidential server not normally used for this purpose (not refuted by Trump), and no investigation of Biden by US officials and been conducted. \n\nGiven the slimness of his win in 2016, does anyone believe Trump would have won the election but for the criminal investigation into \"her emails\"? It's clear as day that Trump was trying to replicate \"her emails\" in the 2020 election with a phony \"Ukraine scandal\" involving Joe Biden. \n\nLet's be clear: Trump was trying to steal the 2020 election. None of the examples cited by Prof. Blackman were so singularly directed at influencing the outcome of the President's own election. It's that simple. Moreover, the fact that other Presidents got away with scandalous conduct in the past is no justification for giving Trump's conduct a free pass now. After all, President Bill Clinton was impeached under circumstances that wouldn't have raised an eyebrow in the 19th Century.",

And, people are more confused than ever.  I have worked some in journalism and I have seen this happen repeatedly.\n\nTrump should not be president.  The Palestinians should not be crushed out of existence by Israel with the support of the US.  Iraq and Afghanistan should not be occupied by the US.  Peter Phillips in his book \"Giants: The Global Power Elites\" should be familiar to anyone wishing to understand why the wealth of the world, and its power centers, are as they are.  30,000 people a day die from starvation and malnutrition in the world when there is fully enough food to feed everyone.

Because, in the end, we're dealing with a matter of interpretation, all good and even great minds will not think alike.  I lean toward the Neal Katyal/Lawrence Tribe side of things, but can give the author of this essay his due.  I don't find this particularly odd, but I am struck by the fact that no one seems to acknowledge it.  Wouldn't it be incredible if Lindsey Graham could say something like, \"It's clear to me why people on the other side of this find serious fault in President Trump's actions.  If he were a Democrat, we'd be having similar fits\".  Or, if Chuck Schumer could say, \"There's often a fine line between corruption and what we do as politicians.  In this case I think the president stepped over that line, but I understand why some do not\".  Maybe I'm naive, but it seems like something less than scorched earth would do a world of good.",

But this article significantly downplays his demagogic tendencies and the ways in which his campaign does sometimes resemble a left-wing version of Trumpism.\n\nSanders' tendency to promise pie in the sky is deeply unsettling. \"Free college\" is as impractical and unlikely as Trump's wall. So many of his policies are non-starters politically, ideas that would never get off the ground in Congress, as Sanders surely knows after decades of failing to build a coalition behind them in the Senate. \n\nAnd let's not pretend billionaires have been the sole focus of Sanders' rage. Try asking any \"Bernie Bro\" about Hillary. It's no coincidence that so many Sanders' supporters voted for Trump, unable to draw a distinction between Clinton--whom they decried as a \"corporate whore\" for not being liberal enough--and Trump, a real threat to American democracy. They believed what Bernie told them. \n\nI remain uncertain about Sanders. He seems to me extremely vulnerable to the negative campaigning Trump will throw at him, and even if he wins, he seems uniquely unsuited to break the partisan gridlock that would likely strangle any policy initiatives.

Populist is not a pejorative term but demagogue is. Now sometimes Sanders does tiptoe along that demagogue line. There is a difference between a president who never had any intention of fulfilling his populist promises and a president who believes in his pie-in-the-sky promises but has zero probability of carrying them out.

In the west the party was incorporated into an movement destined to fail  (the free silver movement).\n\nI think populism's defeat in the south and win in the prairie provinces is instructive.  The PP failed because  it was insufficiently anti-racist -- had the anti racist forces collaborated to defeat a common enemy we would be living a better world. \n\nThe Sanders movement understands this -- is is being bolstered by anti-racist, populist movements like the movement for black lives; a movement that is right to believe that the system is rigged in favor of an entrenched elite.\n\nIt's also right to believe in virtues of everyday people.

Such is NOT the case in this country.  Johnson's Great Society attempt at this has basically been a failure because, instead of promoting self-improvement, the culture of \"let the government pay for it\" has exploded exponentially.   As a result, entire generations of many families have no idea what it mean to have a job.   Sanders idea is to tax the rich for the poor; making this a redistribution of wealth whether he claims it or not.  But what happens when this is not enough?

Only a candidate with realistic proposals and an unflappable countenance who can stand up to the bully-in-chief will have a chance at the White House.  Pease don't let it be Bernie.",

A populist is someone who pits \"us,\" the homogenized virtuous people vs. \"them,\" the undeserving power and money \"mongers.\"  Populists promise you something for nothing, because they think you are \"due\" it.  A chicken in every pot in the case of Huey Long, or in Bernie's, \"free everything for everyone,\" which someone else will pay for, but they'll get your vote.  Sanders does demonize others: the \"elites,\" Clinton, Biden, and now Warren to name a few.  He also doesn't even join the 230 year old Democratic party who's nomination he so desperately seeks, again, nor does he help party leadership, or share his much heralded donations with the party.   Mr. Sanders says he's in it for others, but in the end only a selfish person purports to have the only answers:the leader as personification of the people.  Authoritarianism often goes hand in hand with populism because of this.  So does corruption, as we are witnessing today.  That so many think \"let's try his way,\" speaks to how miserable the Republican minority are making life for so many, but there are other ways and remedies.  I'll take flawed pluralism anyday over most brands of populism.  By the way, Denmark does not have a populist government.",

This is why the MSM and pundits got it wrong in 2016, and are still getting it wrong. Yes, a lot of voters crossed party lines, but they didn't cross the ideological line of populism. \n\nAs a result, the best way to defeat Trump is to run Sanders who can appeal to the Trump voters and their economic interests, while also appealing to Democrats on that same basis, as well as on the basis of MFA, the GND, the environment, and judicial reform.\n\nPopulism isn't bad, it's the people that co-opt it for bad purposes who are bad.",

I am not certain that Bernie can beat Trump in 2020, but I am certain that an overwhelming Wall Street banality like Obama, or a Wall Street cheerleader like Hillary, will not win back the working class people who supported Bernie and Trump in 2016.\n\nHillary is out there bashing Bernie so that she can be responsible for electing Trump twice.\n\nObama needed to pass a 12 trillion dollar infrastructure investment program when he took office with control of both Houses of Congress, and he needed to require banks he was bailing out to make loans.  Instead, he gave 1 trillion in bail outs to Wall Street, trillions more in printed money to the banks without requirements to make loans, and only provided a 1 trillion dollar stimulus for the masses.\n\nBernie was sincere in 2016 in addressing working class problems, and Trump was insincere but spoke about working class economic issues.  And Trump believes in stimulating the economy (no matter how ham-handed it is better than the Obama-Hillary \"sound money\" policies that only help the wealthy).\n\nObama and Hillary belong back in the Republican Party where they might tame down its idiocy.  Bernie is an old-timey Democrat, and he does not insult gun owners, nor mock other aspects of working class culture.  Bernie might not beat Trump in 2020, but he has a better chance than a Hillary clone of either sex.",

Denmark and some other European countries were able to get there not because they strip their rich of the wealth - for that matter, there are no wealth taxes almost anywhere, and if we include state and local taxes an average billionaire in NYC is taxes on income about as much as in Germany (and more than in Switzerland or Ireland).

He cannot enact his social legislation; he cannot strip the profit motive from the capitalists; he cannot convert our capitalist system to Danish like Democratic Socialism. The fact is, the Danes have made a social compact that stresses the common good versus the competition that underpins our economy.  Thise  who profit from our economy are not going to march to Bernie\u2019s version of L\u2019Internationale. Most of us believe we are on the profit side of the ledger.\nBernie pushes all the buttons that stimulate progressive minded Americans to overlook the impracticality of his proposals and his inability to enact them. \nFine tuning Obama\u2019s idea of putting capitalism on a lease with Obamacare, Dodd-Frank and enacting campaign finance reform with teeth is realistic progressiveness. Bernie\u2019s appeal to emotion damages the possibility of realistic solutions.",

The heck with 'polls.' \"\n\nIn my lifetime, Castro certainly \"got a pass\" from even a few non-Communists \"because his country was all but under attack from - among others - US.\" It's devilishly hard to \"play God\" at the time these tradeoffs occur. In fact, even 60+ years after he came to power (and took the dramatic early steps that were not universally applauded), it's not clear what judgment Mr. History would make. I very much suspect that it is (and always will be) one of those split verdicts where a truly objective student would say, \"There are no axioms in History as there are in Math.\" \"Democracy\" can be a lot harder to certify than the author would have us believe.

Recognizing that immigrants are human beings with human rights would undoubtedly help those who are currently treated as sub-human.\n\nTrump's policies, on the other hand, are nothing but lip service designed to divide the 99%. One example is Trump's trade war, which undisputably has hurt American farmers, the same people he pretends to represent.

It certainly is not about any label. I guess I have to include myself in that scorned-upon \"moderate\" group as I have apparently been kicked out of \"liberal\" and \"progressive\" simply because I don't care for Bernie's leadership style and have the perception that he would be less likely to accomplish the very things he espouses than someone who has a different set of skills, attributes and approaches.  So few so called authorities seem to explicitly recognize that all of the Democrat candidates are essentially the same in terms of where they want to go and what they want to accomplish; that is direction and goals.   They differ in how they work with others, strategy for achieving those objectives.

Populism simply means a political view that privileges the voices of the majority of the population, as opposed to the wealthiest citizens with the most social, economic, and political power. Using this definition, Senator Bernard Sanders is a populist. Within a US context, populist movements have been waged to improve workers rights from the Agrarian revolts in the early 1900s to the formation of unions in the first part of the 20th century, which speaks to the popularity of FDR of the day. Since then, countless ethnic and women studies scholars have discussed at length how US populist movements intentionally excluded women and people of color. Bernie's brand of populism centers women and people of color as laborers as opposed to right-wing populism, which is inherently white nationalist. As a queer biracial woman of color, I find the cultural smears against Bernie supporters as white toxic male \"Bernie Bros\" is intellectually bankrupt and has little data to support it. Bernie's populism in juxtaposition with Trump's brand, will destroy all the fraudulent claims that progressives are elitist and don't care about working-class voters.

It's Ridiculous\" to a much softer \"Please Stop Calling Bernie Sanders a Populist\".  The original title seems to accurately reflect the author's opinion; why change it? \nArguments in this piece are contradictory to Sanders's stated positions. For example, the author criticizes right-wing populists as \"insinuating that some people do not belong at all\".  Sanders himself has stated publicly numerous times that billionaires should not exist in America, i.e. they don't belong at all.  Trump cannot rid America of non-white people to appease his uneducated bigoted supporters any more than Sanders can rid the country of billionaires to appease his own disenfranchised supporters.  Trump and Sanders use the same playbook of pandering to people seeking an \"other\" to blame for lacking what they must feel is some level of status they think they're entitled to.  \nThe author also misses that Trump, like Sanders, does rally his underclass supporters against elites- he just likes to specify it's costal liberal elites that are destroying their life, whereas Sanders paints with a broad brush that all wealthy individuals are bad and must only have become wealthy by ruining the prospects and opportunities for the non-wealthy. \n\nSanders loves authoritarian rule, as long as he's the one making the rules.  Sander's supporters are being duped.",

It was supported in the mid-west and south by farmers, who were hurting economically and wanted tariffs for protection against foreign competition.  They also wanted low interest rates, so they could afford to borrow money to tide them over until their crops sold. So they wanted silver to act as a currency, as well as gold. The most famous leader of the populists and its related ideology, progressivism, was William Jennings Bryan, who ran for president in 1896, declaring that we should not crucify mankind on a cross of gold. In his Pulitzer Prize--winning book, the Age of Reform, Richard Hofstadter argued that many populists harbored anti-semitic and nativist beliefs. Other historians, such as Laurence Goodwyn, argued that they were democrats.\n\nBernie Sanders is basically on the left-wing of the Democratic Party, whose views can be traced back to Henry Wallace, Secretary of Agriculture and later Vice-President during FDR's third term. Like Bernie, he was an idealist, who argued that we could have cooperative relations with the Soviet Union after World War II.  Centrists in the Democratic Party became alarmed, and persuaded Roosevelt to drop him from the ticket in 1944 and replace him with Harry Truman. In September of 1946, Truman fired him as Secretary of Commerce. He then formed a third party the Progressives, and ran for president in 1948.",

Give me the \"billionaire\" Bloomberg over the \"millionaire\" Sanders any day. Mike is so clearly better equipped to occupy the Oval Office. We need a calm, focused, accomplished hand on the rudder of our ship--a ship torpedoed by Trump and his minions. Bloomberg's lack of charm, his no-nonsense pragmatism is just what is needed after the ridiculous excess, both in style and substance, of the Trump era.",

They are mainstream in the happiest countries on earth. Countries where people live longest, have strong social safety nets, and are less violent. Armed men do not roam their streets, and children do not hide in school shooting drills. Oh, the horrors!\n\nThe Democratic party expends resources on social identity politics that long forgot that most women are far more afraid of the trapdoor under their feet than they are concerned about the glass ceiling 50 stories above their heads. \n\nBernie addressed the concerns of those women and their families. I suspect every time they hear someone saying Bernie is \"not a real Democrat\" they get excited. They don't want \"real\" Democrats who can tell Camembert from ch\u00e8vre but can't tell SNAP from Snapple.  \n\n Bernie is the real third way.  His supporters know, because he tells them, that he cannot accomplish the programs he champions without a Democratic Congress and the strength of popular support. His \"revolution\" aims to end the Reagan one that has stifled us for forty years. Both sides of the aisle want him defeated. We know that so hit pieces are expected - and have no effect.\n\nIt is better to fight the good fight for what you want then to surrender to the status quo that is killing you.",

That means he thinks he knows how history will turn out and that is in a utopia of no markets and no money, because we will all receive according to our needs from those according to their means.  Without that fundamental ideological belief, Sanders would be content to join the Democratic Party and not just con millions of people by using that party to run for President.  It means he would have no qualms about eliminating \"capitalists,\" even if only as a last resort, to achieve socialist \"equality.\"  Capitalists are the exploiter in every socialist's worldview.  It means he would have no qualms about using coercion to get his way and lock up or otherwise remove people from society if they should disagree with him.  That is what Maduro and Chavez have done in Venezuela.  It is what the Chinese have done to dissidents and are doing to the Uighurs of Xinjiang now.  It is what Stalin did in Soviet Russia.  You think benign old Sanders wouldn't, but no one actually knows what he's like yet.  Trump is going to get about telling the country.  And he's going tap into a sentiment in the country that Sanders' supporters chose to ignore or don't understand.  Socialist candidates for President in 2016 got only 94,000 votes nationwide.  That means that not even Sanders support voted socialist.  The should thin about that.",

Several months after Warren's wealth tax was announced, Sanders understood and took on Warren's economic advisers to work on his wealth tax. That's what I mean; Warren has the best plans.",

On many campuses right wing speakers have been unable to speak because of actions on the left. That is not democracy. Colleges should be a place where all types of views are allowed to heard as long as that can take place peacefully. Whether or not this is populism on the left it is concerning and may enter mainstream politics the way extreme views on the right have now entered mainstream politics and are beginning to turn the US into an authoritarian state.",

Ideologues who tend to demonize the other side have never achieved anything -- case in point, look at Bernie Sanders: great talk and nothing to show for it.   But back to electoral politics:  democracy demands that if one's candidate does not win one stays in the game and seeks to win another day.   Sanders has spawned a cadre of \"supporters\" who - like spoiled brats - must have their way or would tear the place the down.   This is anti-democratic.   Sanders's rhetoric is unrelenting, single-minded, refusing to see nuance, and -- frankly -- simple-minded.  You would hollow out this country and ruin it if you sent ALL billionaires packing.

There can be socially progressive and economically leftwing populists as well, such as Podemos in Spain and Corbyn in the UK.  It is not about 'socialism' per se but a style of intolerant rhetoric which is both anti-establishment and pro vox populi. The 'object' of the intolerance differs but it remains intolerance. Most populists are radicals but not all; and not all radicals are populists.  Mudde and Karvallser said as much years ago by distinguishing what they termed 'inclusive' and 'exclusive' versions of populism.  To claim that there is only one variety of 'rightwing' populism is to focus on major cases in Western Europe to the exclusion of populism in the rest of the world.",

The tax system thus drives a wedge between the social and private return to work. \u2026High marginal tax rates disconnect the private and social returns to economic activity and thereby the invisible hand ceases to function. \n\nFor this reason, taxation causes distortions and is costly to society. High marginal tax rates make it less worthwhile to supply labor on the formal labor market and more worthwhile to spend time on household work, black market activities and tax avoidance.",

If he had done so early and more assertively during the campaign we may very well be in a different place now.

Why not  for all Americans?  Radical? \nBernie's \"socialism\" does not advocate \"nationalizing the means of production.\"  He advocates reasonable regulation, universally accepted by Democrats and most Republicans before the disastrous extreme right wing policies of Ronald Regan began  transferring ownership of assets and growth in income to the billionaire class.  That was extreme!  \nPragmatic regulation prevented the crises that have destroyed so much of the 99%, like the Savings bank crash in the 1980's and the crash in 2008.  Unregulated capitalism always leads to such crashes, as it has throughout much of US history.  Regulation prevented such crashes from FDR through the 1970's. \n\"Neutral\" media and \"mainstream\" critics labeling Bernie a fringe candidate is ahistorical.  Returning to the low level of income inequality we had during the halcyon days of reasonable regulation during much of my lifetime is hardly extreme.  \nTax cuts that reduced taxes by trillions providing benefits exclusively for the wealthy, that's extreme.",

What is also very telling to people is to watch his own party elites attack him with obvious disingenuous smears. It tells them that he's on to something and doing something right and it gets their interest in what he has to say.

And then he's representing the 99%, not the 1%.\n\nThe divisiveness comes from the Centrist, Establishment Left that doesn't want to change the status quo. While many Clintonites still complain that Sanders' supporters didn't vote for Hillary in 2016, I see far more Centrists say they could never vote for Sanders in 2020. In fact, some of Sanders supporters who didn't vote for Hillary were never going to. They were Trump supporters that Bernie took away with his populist message. And in that the author is correct. That's where the Trump and Sanders overlap, and where Sanders has the advantage relative to other Democratic candidates of being able to reduce the size of Trump's base by appealing to a significant enough percentage of his voters. And significant could be 3,4 or 5%. That's all it could take to swing the election.",

Especially how Trump is some type of economic Houdini as he brags at Davos. The truth is that Trump is an expert in manipulating people's perception (even if lies) through spinning fantasies in the media. If he can arm twist all of the GOP party & use his Fox propaganda wing to distort the truth, then he wins the perception war. His followers (& Wall St.) don't want to hear the real truth but only sugar coated fantasies that Trump spins so masterfully about how the economy is so great under his leadership. On the one hand he rails against NAFTA & the selling out of America's good paying jobs & then turns around & only tinkers with the old trade agreement & repackages it as the greatest trade deal since sliced bread. The latest Phase One \"deal\" only came about quickly before he was going to impose new tariffs (consumer taxes) on Chinese imports prior to Christmas which would've hurt the economy even further & risk his re-election chances in 2020. Then he has the Chinese supposedly agree to billions in Ag. purchases w/o any penalties if they don't. He just spins the content to seem as if he & his \"supporters\" are really \"winning.\" I'm tired of all this faux winning w/o ever seeing any results to my pocketbook. Tired of being played like a pawn in his Presidential grifter game. Tired of being lied to over & over again w/o accountability.",

Krugman may not like Trump and his actions, but Trump saved our life and well being by taking some simple and practical measures without sacrificing any idealism.",

Unemployment is low, but wages have stagnated. Many people can\u2019t live on the wages they make in one full time job. People working full time live in their cars and are eligible for food stamps\n4. Most Americans can not come up with $500 to pay for an unexpected expense\n5. Most Americans have only $11,000 saved up for retirement\n6. Childhood poverty has increased under Trump\n7. Homelessness has increased under Trump. His administration has done nothing to make housing more affordable. HUD is run by a neurosurgeon. \n8. Young people graduate from college in debt with a degree which will not get them a job anywhere but Starbucks\n9. Consumer bankruptcies have increased largely due to debts arising from unaffordable healthcare\n\nThe only bright side in the economic front is the stock market, which has been on a roll for the longest period ever without a recession. Trump is doing his best to shut off this light by his sowing political uncertainty (Sulemani\u2019s assassination) and enacting off the cuff tariffs, which as Mr. Friedman so ably explains, violate US law. The present day economy has only benefitted the rich (people worth $5 million or more). The rich are not Trump\u2019s base. His base has been hurt by his economic mismanagement. \n\nHistorically, presidents get re-elected if the economy is good.  \u201cAre you better off under Trump.\u201d",

The US trade \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d  the upper 1 percent having strong influence by the lobbists on the US government did not care that our economy was in decline or we become dependent on totalitarian regime such as China. China had played it smartly pretending being a friendly nation and downplaying the fact that they are by definition a totalitarian regime. While many US companies invested huge amount of money there China requested mandatory technology transfer. Recently their leader became a dictator. In small steps China had continued to become a clear a threat to the western world. In spite of calling themselves the US allies the Europeans traded with Russia against whom we have been defending them since WWII. When Russia invaded Crimea we learned that our European allies kept selling to Putin sophisticated weapons and France was caught building three warships for Russia at that time. President Obama had to exert significant pressure to stop France from selling the warship.The EU especially Germany had developed a cozy relationship with China that become wealthy through the trade with the US.The truth is that Europeans does not care about totalitarian China or Russia and they would be happy to trade with totalitarian Iran not caring if they have nuclear weapons or that the Iranian young people wish to live in a democratic country.",

It is an important part of heavy industry that can be diverted to military production, which is what happened in WW II as domestic car production was put on hiatus. One reason the American car industry still exists is because of deliberate federal protection.  When Japan began to make inroads they were forced to limit imports and move some production to this country.  Both Chrysler and General Motors have now been bailed out when they were in difficulty.  Of course other countries do not hesitate to aid their own car industries.\n\nA real security threat is probably not important to Trump, but this does illustrate how there is really no such thing as \"free trade\" internationally.  What must be realized is that national interests are not identical to the maximization of profits by international capitalists.  Those interests include the welfare of workers as well as security.\n\nKrugman is probably right that Trump's tariffs are a means of compelling support for his foreign policy, but such moves are also a means of displaying at least ostensible support for American workers.  The voters who are actually affected by globalization are probably not impressed by economists' arguments on the basis of comparative advantage.  International trade may still be an issue that favors Trump if Democrats and economists do not show that they have plans to reverse the harm that globalization has done to American workers.",

It makes no difference to Trump that tariffs are not simply a social punishment and have nothing to do with national security.  Similarly, Trump said that it makes no difference that there was no imminent threat from Suleimani, he was a bad man so that Trump could kill him without notifying Congress.  Trump gave Erdogan permission to enter Syria an murder Kurds, turn thousands into refugees, and enable ISIS.  He was ignorant of the consequences as a result of consulting no one on his actions, and therefore it was OK.\n\nIt is no longer popular to refer to Trump as a pathological narcissist and a sociopath.  Yet a quick Google on the subject yields many psychologists that have concluded that his behavior is consistent with that diagnosis.\n\nTrump is just plain missing the portion of his human empathy that allows him be affected by consequences to his actions.  Tariffs, foreign policy, domestic tax policy are all just part of his government sandbox with no adults in supervision.",

The Constitution divided the government into three branches, executive, legislative and judicial, and the setting of tariffs would normally be in the province of the legislative branch.\n\nBut Democrats cannot complain too loudly.\n\nAfter all, it was Obama who offered a temporary amnesty to \"dreamers\" which was regarded by many as an abuse of executive action.  It was argued that the proper venue for changes in immigration law was Congress, where negotiation would eventually lead to revised immigration policies which neither side would fully embrace, but each side could live with.\n\nWhy should Congress negotiate, if whatever it does can be undone by the Executive Branch?\n\nThe two extremes are not tenable.  We should be treating illegal immigrants fairly and with compassion, whatever that means.  At the other extreme, is open borders, which will gradually bankrupt America's safety net for the poor.\n\nExcessive partisanship, driven first by Obama's executive action, and then by Trump's inflammatory rhetoric about building a wall, has made agreement on immigration policy all but impossible.\n\nTrump is partly to blame, but also the Democrats.",

The American people democratically decided that they do not want those policies and elected Trump on his promises to change them. That is called democracy - live with it. If you don't like the new policies, then convince the voters to vote for someone else in 2020. For someone who will revert to the same old killing of American industries via unfair trade with so-called 'allies' to protect us all from scary Putin. Good luck with that. Meanwhile Trump managed to extract important unilateral trade concessions from China even without lifting most tariffs - just by threatening to introduce new ones. Tariffs work to make trade fair. The very fact that China agreed to US conditions without getting anything in return clearly shows that US-China trade was not fair before and drained US of money unnecessarily. Is that what Krugman advocates? American workers paying for good life in China and Europe out of their pockets? Because they are our allies? I don't think so.",

Now the foreign makers are here and still, Detroit can't see the winds of change.\n\nBut beside the background, the Tariffs are likely meant to offset the large budget deficit increase Trump's and Republicans tax cuts created. \n\nThe wealthy are bailing out and ruining us as they leave.\n\nAnd the Trump Wall st wants to keep us in.",

Revenue from tariffs narrow the budget deficit by imposing a flat tax on American consumers. Smaller budget gaps make reckless tax cuts for corporations and billionaires more palatable for Americans who worry about the deficit.  The tariff idea was a component of Paul Ryan's tax plan to cut taxes for nearly ten years.  It was called the BAT. Bat was omitted from Trump's tax cut; but Trump is recouping the revenue through direct tariffs.  Tariffs are here to stay.",

As for the Patriot act and all of the subsequent invasions of our civil liberties, it is time for an American revolution at the ballot box and an opening of our society. No more metal detectors, barriers, and Pat downs. These are nonsense jobs just made to turn us into sheep.",

What better way to tear apart any and all alliance with \"the Free World\" than to do it under the pretense of patriotism - to help re-balance America's trade deficit and to generate more manufacturing jobs for the US? And if Putin were to have a mole sleeping and watching Fox and Friends, will he do it any different?\n\nWell, that is the point. Three cheers for Putin.",
