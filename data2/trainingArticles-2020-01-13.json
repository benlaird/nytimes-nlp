            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Trump\u2019s Frightening Vision of the Presidency Is on \nTrial, Too  The president believes that what is good for him and what is good \nfor the country are indistinguishable.  By Susan Hennessey and Benjamin Wittes \nMs. Hennessey and Mr. Wittes are the authors of the forthcoming \u201cUnmaking the \nPresidency: Donald Trump\u2019s War on the World\u2019s Most Powerful Office.\u201d When the \ntrial of President Trump begins, perhaps as soon as this week, the Senate will \nformally confront only the two questions posed by the articles of impeachment \npassed in the House of Representatives. Did Mr. Trump abuse the powers of his \noffice in his interactions with Ukraine? And did he obstruct Congress\u2019s \ninvestigation of that matter? But the real question before the Senate is far \nbroader than the specific scandal recounted in the articles. What is on trial, \nat the most basic level, is Mr. Trump\u2019s vision of the American presidency. It \nmay seem to give Mr. Trump too much credit to suggest that he has a coherent \nvision of the presidency; he is plainly not a political theorist. But over his \nthree years in office, and in the campaign that preceded them, he actually has \nput a vision of the presidency on the table. Throughout this most unusual \nadministration, Mr. Trump has shown how he imagines the presidency should work, \nwhat he believes it is for and how he thinks its powers should be deployed. The \nUkraine scandal presents a near-perfect distillation of Mr. Trump\u2019s conception \nof his office \u2014 and the House\u2019s articles of impeachment will put many of the \nelements of his vision before the Senate for judgment.  Fundamentally, Mr. Trump\n proposes that the purpose of executive power is to serve the individual \ninterests of the president. It serves the public good only coincidentally and \nonly when convenient. Throughout his tenure, Mr. Trump has rarely needed to \nexceed the limits of executive power in order to abuse his office. Rather, he \nhas inflicted damage again and again by personalizing and misusing powers that \nthe presidency clearly possesses. That is what happened in the Ukraine affair, \nwhich is a scandal less because of the specific acts Mr. Trump took than because\n of why he took them. As president, from the moment he swore an oath to \n\u201cfaithfully execute the office of the president of the United States\u201d and to \n\u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d the Constitution, Mr. Trump has never pretended \nthat he serves an interest larger than his own. Rather, he boldly asserts that \nthere is no public good distinct from his personal, political and financial \ninterests \u2014 that what is good for him and what is good for the country are \nindistinguishable. This is why he seems unable to fathom that he did anything \nwrong in the Ukraine affair: His attempt, by leveraging military aid, to force \nan embattled country\u2019s president to investigate one of Mr. Trump\u2019s political \nopponents was business as usual. This personalized vision of his office and its \npower is why Mr. Trump openly embraces deploying law enforcement authorities \nagainst his political enemies. Law enforcement should go after the bad guys and \nprotect the good guys. But to Mr. Trump, the \u201cgood guys\u201d are his friends and the\n \u201cbad guys\u201d are his enemies. In the earliest days of his administration, that \nview led him to ask his F.B.I. director to drop an investigation of his national\n security adviser and to demand that the attorney general investigate Hillary \nClinton. With the Ukraine affair, the impulse is merely exported to the arena of\n foreign policy, where the president is even less legally constrained than he is\n domestically. If it is legitimate to use the awesome law enforcement powers of \nthe American federal government to serve Mr. Trump\u2019s interests, why shouldn\u2019t he\n expect a foreign leader to do the same? In Mr. Trump\u2019s highly personalized \npresidency, foreign policy is a matter of impulse and whim, with no concern for \nfacts or national interests. As fateful a step as the killing of an Iranian \nmilitary figure can take place because the president, upset about leaks and \nnegative press coverage, wants to look stronger than his predecessor. When \nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey suggested to Mr. Trump that United \nStates forces could withdraw from Syria, the president was happy to oblige \nwithout any significant consideration of the consequences \u2014 even announcing it \non Twitter. But when the newly elected president of Ukraine requested a meeting \nat the White House, Mr. Trump required \u201ca favor\u201d first. In every policy arena, \nthe president\u2019s traditional management functions \u2014 as chief executive of a giant\n organization \u2014 have been subsumed by Mr. Trump\u2019s desire for self-expression and\n impulsive announcements of his desired outcomes. In issuing the hastily written\n travel ban in his very first week in office, Mr. Trump chose to push aside the \ndepartments of State, Justice, Defense and Homeland Security. Those departments \nthen had to spend months contorting themselves to claim that a travel ban \naffecting Muslims was not the Muslim ban that candidate Trump had promised.  In \nthe Ukraine affair, Mr. Trump again overrode ordinary processes. A request that \na foreign country announce an investigation didn\u2019t go through the Justice \nDepartment and the State Department; instead the president\u2019s private emissary, \nRudy Giuliani, represented the United States government. Why should Mr. Trump \nstick to the talking points his staff prepared for his conversation with \nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky? Why should he agree, as his own senior officials \npleaded with him to do, to release military aid instead when he could hold onto \nthe leverage a bit longer? Those officials were attempting to carry out the \nstated United States policy \u2014 providing Ukraine with support to hold off Russian\n occupation of its territory. But our national security interests were no match \nfor the president\u2019s own political interests. Here\u2019s the thing: In a very basic \nsense, Mr. Trump has the power to do all of this. In his efforts to pressure \nUkraine, there have been few specific deployments of presidential power that \nexceed the formal boundaries of his authority. If he had undertaken the same \nacts for some public-spirited reason, each might individually be construed as a \ndefensible exercise of presidential power. What makes this scandal a scandal is \nnot the specific powers that he deployed but the corrupt vision of the \npresidency that lay beneath his use of them. In the impeachment trial, senators \nwill vote on whether to ratify the propriety of Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior \u2014 and \nRepublican senators will no doubt seek refuge in the narrowness of the articles \nand the constitutional technicalities of executive power. But they will also be \njudging the legitimacy of Mr. Trump\u2019s vision.  That, in all likelihood, they \nwill not vote to convict the president does not diminish the importance of the \nquestion at stake in his trial \u2014 whether it is O.K. to understand the presidency\n as Mr. Trump apparently does and to use the powers of the office to realize \nthat vision.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Trump\u2019s Plot Against Health Care Continues He is \nstill coming for your coverage \u2014 and lying about it. By Paul Krugman Opinion \nColumnist Make no mistake: Health care will be on the ballot this November. But \nnot in the way ardent progressives imagine. Democrats running for president have\n spent a lot of time debating so-called Medicare for all, with some supporters \nof Bernie Sanders claiming that any politician who doesn\u2019t demand immediate \nimplementation of single-payer health care is a corporate tool, or something. \nBut the reality is that whatever its merits, universal, government-provided \nhealth insurance isn\u2019t going to happen anytime soon. I say this because even if \nDemocrats take the Senate in addition to the White House, the votes for \neliminating private health insurance won\u2019t be there; nor will the kind of \noverwhelming public support that might change that calculus. In practice, any of\n the Democratic candidates \u2014 even Sanders \u2014 will, if victorious, end up building\n on and improving Obamacare. On the other hand, if Donald Trump wins, he will \nprobably find a way to kill Obamacare, and tens of millions of Americans will \nlose health coverage. Let\u2019s talk for a minute about Obamacare. There\u2019s a sort of\n perverse alliance between Republicans and some progressives, both of whom are \ndetermined, albeit for different reasons, to see the Affordable Care Act as a \nfailure. These downbeat assessments are made easier by the fact that the A.C.A. \nleft much of its implementation up to the states, and that national performance \nhas been held down by states that have done their best to sabotage health \nreform. But look at states that have tried to make the law work, and what you \nsee is a huge if incomplete policy success. Take the case of California. In \n2010, before the A.C.A. went into effect, 21 percent of nonelderly Californians \nwere uninsured, above the national average. By 2016 the uninsurance rate had \ndropped to 8 percent. And Californians with pre-existing medical conditions saw \nan enormous improvement in their health and financial security. Now, 8 percent \nuninsured is still too many, and even those with insurance often face high out-\nof-pocket costs. But relatively minor improvements in the law, especially a \nmodest increase in the generosity of insurance subsidies, could substantially \nimprove both the quality and the quantity of coverage. Does pointing out the \npossibility of incremental progress mean giving up on a truly universal system? \nNo. By all means let\u2019s make something more ambitious, such as Medicare for all, \na long-term goal. But this goal shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of policies that \nwould immediately benefit millions of Americans, and save thousands of lives. \nAnd while we debate the ideal health system, we mustn\u2019t forget that Trump and \nhis allies are as determined as ever to undo the progress we\u2019ve made. It\u2019s true \nthat so far repeated Republican attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act have\n failed. In 2012 the Supreme Court rejected claims that the whole law was \nunconstitutional. In 2017 a Republican-controlled Congress narrowly failed to \nrepeal Obamacare. And a variety of narrower efforts to undermine health reform \nand send insurance markets into a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d have fallen short: Markets seem\n to have stabilized, and one by one, states that initially rejected Medicaid \nexpansion have been relenting. But the people who want to take away your health \ncare haven\u2019t given up. The latest attempt is a lawsuit claiming that the 2017 \ntax cut, which reduced the penalty for not having insurance to $0, somehow made \nthe entire Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It\u2019s a ludicrous claim, both in\n terms of substance \u2014 would the law suddenly become constitutional if the \npenalty were a penny? \u2014 and because it\u2019s clear that this was not legislators\u2019 \nintention. But the Trump administration has joined the suit and a partisan \nRepublican judge has indeed ruled that the A.C.A. as a whole should be struck \ndown. Clearly, this case is headed for the Supreme Court. But Trump doesn\u2019t want\n it heard until after the election. Why does Trump want to leave this court case\n hanging? Partly because his side would probably lose. As I said, the lawsuit is\n ludicrous, although, given the partisanship of Republican-appointed judges, it \nmight prevail anyway. Beyond that, however, Trump\u2019s political health care \nstrategy is to flat-out lie about what he has done and is trying to do. On \nMonday he made the breathtakingly dishonest claim that he is \u201cthe person who \nsaved pre-existing conditions\u201d \u2014 breathtaking because he has tried at every \nstage to remove the protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions \ncreated by the Affordable Care Act. And while Trump, who lies constantly, often \nseems to pay little penalty for those lies, this one \u2014 which touches the lives \nof millions of voters \u2014 would be thrown into sharp relief if the case were heard\n by the Supreme Court. He wants to take away your health care, but he doesn\u2019t \nwant you to see him doing it until the election is behind him. So that\u2019s the \nreal health care issue this year. Will it be expanded coverage under a Democrat \n\u2014 it probably doesn\u2019t matter much which one \u2014 or will it be tens of millions of \nnewly uninsured Americans under Trump?

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Bearable Whiteness of \u2018Little Women\u2019 There is a \nfine line between a story that is about the worldview of a specific person and \none that declares that this worldview is the only one that matters. By Kaitlyn \nGreenidge Ms. Greenidge is a contributing opinion writer. About a week before \n\u201cLittle Women\u201d premiered in December, the tweets started rolling across my \ntimeline. \u201cI don\u2019t care about \u2018Little Women\u2019,\u201d read one. Another pondered why \nthis movie was being made now. And a perhaps kinder one that more aptly \ndescribed the derision, \u201cLittle Women is white women\u2019s Black Panther.\u201d I think I\n understand those reactions. \u201cLittle Women\u201d is a book that its devotees tend to \nstress as a defining description of American girlhood. Its characters are \nlovingly interpreted as archetypes. Every girl, it is decided, must be in some \npart a Jo, a Meg, a Beth or an Amy. It\u2019s that assumption of universality that \nirks when you are a black girl reader. In the decades since \u201cLittle Women\u201d was \npublished, children\u2019s novels with black girl heroines have also been published \u2014\n \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\u201d; \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d; the works of Virginia \nHamilton and Octavia Butler. But they do not possess the assumption of lingua \nfranca that \u201cLittle Women\u201d is given in cultural conversations. I do not know \nmany who ask, for example, \u201cAre you a Lauren?\u201d in reference to \u201cParable of the \nSower.\u201d If you are a black girl reading the American canon, you often have to \nperform a special equation. We do not appear in many of the books deemed classic\n literature. As Toni Morrison noted after she wrote her own contribution to the \ncanon, \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d \u201cthat subject \u2014 those most vulnerable, most undescried,\n not taken seriously little black girls \u2014 had never existed seriously in \nliterature. No one had ever written about them except as props.\u201d So when we as \nblack girls read most books, we have to will ourselves into the bodies on the \npage, with a selectivity and an internal edit that white readers of the same \ncanon do not necessarily have to exercise. \u201cSo what?\u201d one might think. Isn\u2019t \nreading fiction an exercise in empathy? But empathy for whom, and for what \nhigher purpose, always complicates this supposedly benevolent action. Is empathy\n really empathy if it\u2019s generally asked to flow in only one direction? Under \nthose circumstances, empathy looks less like identifying with the other and more\n like emotional hegemony. I saw \u201cLittle Women\u201d the day after Christmas, with my \ntwo older sisters and my 12-year-old niece. The film I saw was one that explored\n how the small decisions made in childhood affect a whole life\u2019s trajectory; how\n gender, birth order, social expectations can raise or dampen a spirit; and the \nprices paid for rallying against all those constraints to declare a self. Even \nwith the imbalance of empathy, the criticism of the film\u2019s perceived unbearable \nwhiteness seemed unfair to me. There is a fine line between a piece of art that \nacknowledges it is about the worldview of a very specific person \u2014 in the case \nof \u201cLittle Women,\u201d that of a white girl in Massachusetts, raised in an \nabolitionist family during the Civil War \u2014 and a piece of art that declares that\n this worldview is the only one that matters and is fatally incurious about all \nothers. This adaptation is alive with curiosity and is intent on reminding us of\n the context in which the March sisters lived. This is most evident in the shot \nof the March family walking to a poorer neighbor\u2019s house to give away their \nChristmas dinner and passing the rest of the town leaving morning church \nservices \u2014 an institution to which they do not belong. I should, perhaps, admit \nmy own bias here. Maybe I am too comfortable, too unquestioning of performing \nthese calculations over and over again. I read \u201cA Tree Grows in Brooklyn\u201d three \ntimes a summer, every summer, from ages 12 to 16. I read it so many times, I \nknew the opening lines by heart. \u201cSerene was a word you could put to Brooklyn, \nNew York. Especially in the summer of 1912.\u201d The novel is perfect because it \nends on a question: What kind of person will Francie become? But I didn\u2019t want \nto be Francie. I wanted her to be me. Around the fifth or sixth time I read it, \nI decided that Francie must be black. I just liked her so much. I loved her \nfamily. I read the chapters that told the history of their arrival in America \nover and over, and seized on the phrase \u201cblack Irish.\u201d I grew up in a \npredominantly Irish suburb of Boston \u2014 I knew that people used the phrase to \ndescribe Irish people with darker hair and darker skin. I took that murky \ndefinition and decided it must mean Francie was black like me. Francie \u2014 with \nher fierce and sometimes unknowable mother, in her allegiance to her block, in \nher ability, borne of necessity, to create better worlds for herself inside her \nmind \u2014 all of these read as markers of black girlhood to me. I claimed her as \nmine. When I made my claim, I did not feel as if I were betraying my blackness. \nIndeed, I felt an immense power, as if I\u2019d found a way to read the book that \nonly I was clever enough to discover. So I feel conflicted about the criticisms \nof \u201cLittle Women.\u201d I understand the fatigue of watching a prestigious film about\n white women being claimed as a cultural watershed for women everywhere. But I \nalso feel the pull of narrative, of images on the screen, of watching an artist \nbuild a world and inviting others to enter. \u201cWhere are the black characters?\u201d I \nremember reading on Twitter. And then a response saying you don\u2019t want to see \ndirector Greta Gerwig trying to portray black characters. Never mind that Ms. \nGerwig did include black actors as townspeople. And then the turn again: Let\u2019s \nstop imagining ourselves in white stories and instead create our own. To this \npoint, I think of the life of Ellen Garrison Jackson. Nine years older than \nLouisa May Alcott, she was a black girl in Concord, Mass., the second generation\n to live in her family\u2019s homestead. Like Alcott, she grew up in a family \ncommitted to radical social change. Her mother worked as an abolitionist, \noccasionally working in coalition with white female activists in Concord. In \n1866, she initiated an early lawsuit over segregation in public transportation, \ntesting the nation\u2019s first Civil Rights Act and predating Rosa Parks and the \nMontgomery bus boycott by nearly a century. Many of the things that readers \nrespond to in the story of the March family \u2014 the questions of how to live a \nlife of moral fortitude in an immoral world; the fierceness of righting \ninjustices that young girls feel when they encounter the world \u2014 are a part of \nthe history of Ellen Garrison Jackson. She could easily and with historical \naccuracy be included in the \u201cLittle Women\u201d universe. The fact that she isn\u2019t \nspeaks to the value of the question of \u201cWhere are we?\u201d The question can be \nvaluable in helping to find the stories that are deeper and more complicated \nthan the conventions of narrative fiction. In the movie theater, watching the \nMarch sisters onscreen, I sat beside my own sisters, Alcott superfans, and my \nniece, who has been dragged to Orchard House, the Alcotts\u2019 home in Concord, more\n times than she can count. Watching a movie and dissecting it scene by scene \nafterward with my sisters is one of my keenest pleasures, one I took for granted\n in childhood. One I recognize as an adult now as rare. As we left the theater, \nwe fell into the practiced conversation of sisters, a volley of interjections, \nan endless round of \u201cand then,\u201d \u201cbut so,\u201d \u201cand now.\u201d It is worthwhile to point \nto the absences, the silences, the erasures in stories. But the questions should\n be an invitation to creation, not an end to conversation.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by J.Lo Was Robbed. Latinas Were Robbed. Jennifer Lopez \ndidn\u2019t get an Oscar nod for her career-best turn in \u201cHustlers.\u201d Her snub \nhighlights a larger problem with Hollywood\u2019s Latinx representation. By Carlos \nAguilar Mr. Aguilar is a film critic. Jennifer Lopez was having a moment.  For \nher performance as an enterprising exotic dancer in Lorene Scafaria\u2019s \n\u201cHustlers,\u201d the Ms. Lopez earned some of the highest praise of her career. A \nstrong awards season campaign was mounted, and she was honored with a string of \nnominations and wins among film critics\u2019 circles at the end of last year. \nMomentum seemed to be building for her to earn a nod for a best supporting \nactress Oscar \u2014 with most awards season pundits deeming Ms. Lopez\u2019s chances in \nthe category a fairly sure bet. Yet on Monday, Ms. Lopez\u2019s name was not among \nthose announced during the Oscar nominations unveiling. The extreme \ndisappointment I feel is twofold.  While the track record of the Academy of \nMotion Picture Arts and Sciences as a measurement of artistic excellence is \ndebatable, its cultural cachet is undeniable. A nomination for Ms. Lopez would \nhave burnished her legacy as an actress, more than 25 years after her breakout \nrole in \u201cSelena.\u201d  Even more dispiriting is what Ms. Lopez\u2019s snub means for \nLatinx representation more broadly \u2014 Ms. Lopez was the only Latinx performer \nwith a real shot of recognition in the major categories this year and seemed to \nshoulder much of the burden of fending off another #OscarsSoWhite. (A kind \nreminder that the Spanish-born Antonio Banderas, who earned a deserved \nnomination for best actor for \u201cPain and Glory,\u201d is not Latinx.) The absence of \nLatinx representation is a longstanding issue for the academy. Had she been \nnominated, Ms. Lopez would have been the first American Latinx actress singled \nout by the academy since Rosie Perez, who earned a best supporting actress nod \nin 1994 for \u201cFearless.\u201d The magnitude of this quarter-of-a-century gap might be \ndifficult for some to understand at first \u2014 the entertainment industry tends to \nlump together American-born Latinxes, Latin Americans and Hispanics into a \nmonolithic entity, inaccurately plumping numbers in otherwise well-intentioned \nstudies about diversity.  Indeed, only a handful of American Latinx actors have \never been nominated for film\u2019s highest acting honors: In addition to Ms. Perez, \nthey include Rita Moreno (who won in 1962), Jos\u00e9 Ferrer (a winner in 1951), \nEdward James Olmos (nominated in 1989) and Benicio del Toro (a winner in 2001). \nIf only American-born Latinxes were considered in the data research focused on \ndiversity in studio productions and what types of roles they are offered, \ncalling the results dismal would be an understatement. And then there\u2019s the fact\n that no American Latinx filmmaker has ever been nominated for the best director\n Academy Award, in part because they are rarely considered to helm the \n\u201cprestige\u201d films Oscar voters are usually attracted to. It\u2019s evident that an \nillusion of inclusion in relation to Latinx people has permeated Hollywood over \nthe past decade. The heavily decorated Mexican directors Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, \nAlejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Guillermo del Toro \u2014 collectively referred to as\n \u201cthe Three Amigos\u201d \u2014 have served as a flimsy Band-Aid to an industry that \nheralds their accomplishments as proof that everyone who matches their idea of \nLatinx is being celebrated. Mr. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cRoma,\u201d a Latin American behemoth \nbacked by Netflix, took home three awards at last year\u2019s ceremony. This followed\n closely on the heels of Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s \u201cBirdman\u201d and \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d Mr. del \nToro\u2019s \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d and Mr. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cGravity,\u201d all awarded some of the \nhighest honors by the academy. A narrative of substantial Latinx representation \nwas constructed, one that doesn\u2019t acknowledge how that representation hasn\u2019t \ntranslated to the screen even in works by Latin American filmmakers. (Aside from\n \u201cRoma,\u201d which is set in Mexico with Spanish dialogue, those other films starred\n the likes of Sandra Bullock, Leonardo DiCaprio and Michael Keaton.) And \nstateside Latinx creators have been virtually erased both onscreen and behind \nthe camera. This year, without any of the men in the overachieving trio in the \nrace, the mirage of collective advancement has vanished. While the Mexican \ncinematographer Rodrigo Prieto received his third nomination, for \u201cThe \nIrishman,\u201d and the Brazilian filmmaker Petra Costa was nominated for her \ndocumentary \u201cThe Edge of Democracy,\u201d they serve as little consolation. Ms. \nLopez\u2019s snub should show pundits and other observers how blatant the exclusion \ntruly is, not only from the glitz of the red carpet, but more alarmingly, from \nthe production pipeline as a whole. A good start on the path to overhauling this\n outrageous reality is for more people in high places to become aware that Latin\n American and United States-born Latinx people aren\u2019t granted the same \nopportunities, nor are their stories, while related, the same.  The few Latin \nAmerican actresses who\u2019ve been shortlisted for the acting categories in recent \nmemory have delivered monumental performances playing characters exhibiting \nfamiliar tropes: Mexico\u2019s Adriana Barraza in \u201cBabel\u201d as a nanny crossing the \nborder who is eventually deported; Colombia\u2019s Catalina Sandino Moreno in \u201cMaria \nFull of Grace\u201d as a drug mule; and more recently, Yalitza Aparicio in \u201cRoma\u201d as \na housekeeper for an upper-middle-class family in 1970s Mexico City. What\u2019s \nnoteworthy about Ms. Lopez\u2019s turn is that it does not abide by preconceived and \nclich\u00e9d expectations of who a Latinx woman is, specifically one born and raised \nin the United States. In a recent interview with Variety, Ms. Lopez recalled the\n limiting biases that affected the jobs she was offered early in her career: \n\u201cMaybe 30 years ago, it was very \u2018Oh, you\u2019re the Latin girl,\u2019 \u201d she said. \n\u201c\u2018You\u2019ll do Spanish roles; you\u2019ll play maids; you\u2019ll only be limited to this \nlittle box.\u2019 \u201d Characters that are unambiguously Latinx, but are depicted beyond\n their cultural identity, are a rarity \u2014 in several of Ms. Lopez\u2019s earlier \nroles, she often portrayed women who could arguably be coded as white. But as \nRamona in \u201cHustlers,\u201d she doesn\u2019t have to erase her ethnicity. Ramona isn\u2019t a \nLatinx stereotype. There\u2019s no use of Spanish-language dialogue or references to \nher abuela to make the point that she is a Nuyorican.  But the hints are there \u2014\n her last name is Vega, and the actress Emma Batiz, who plays her daughter in \nthe film, is also Latinx. And of course and above all, it\u2019s J.Lo in a role she \nwas meant to play, a role that shows off her strengths, while allowing her to \nbecome the force of nature she hasn\u2019t always seen herself as. \u201cI\u2019ve always been \nso much a romantic, so much about having a relationship, and this woman is the \ntotal opposite,\u201d she told A.O. Scott in an interview for The New York Times \nMagazine. \u201cAnd to play that, to live in those shoes, to walk in those very high \nheels, in that skin, made me realize I\u2019m out here on my own. That\u2019s what I need \nto teach my daughter, that aspect of it, that you can do it on your own.\u201d Ms. \nLopez was Lorene Scafaria\u2019s first choice for Ramona in \u201cHustlers,\u201d and through \nMs. Lopez\u2019s company, Nuyorican Productions, the actress served as a producer of \nthe film. But a couple of questions arise: If it has taken this long for a \nhousehold name like Ms. Lopez to attain such a meaty and perfectly tailored \npart, what\u2019s the fate of those emerging Latinx voices without such clout? And \nwhat does it mean that this type of Latinx character \u2014 not a maid, not a drug \nmule, not a nanny \u2014 wasn\u2019t acknowledged by the academy?  Ms. Lopez will be fine;\n her degree of superstardom and ability to produce her own projects should \nhopefully ensure even more great roles for her. But even if she had been \nnominated this year, no one person can or should shoulder all that \nresponsibility. It\u2019s imperative to have a wide array of Latinxes partaking in \nall disciplines. Pioneers and symbols are important \u2014 needed even, as \nlighthouses in oceans where role models have been scarce \u2014 but more so is \nfoundational change to an industry that continues to bet on our money as \naudiences, but not our talent and stories.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Progressives Are the Real Pragmatists Medicaid \nexpansion is just the latest example of how liberal policies make for good \npolitics. By Jamelle Bouie Opinion Columnist When left-wing Democrats push for \nuniversal benefits and expansive new policies, they do so with a theory of \npolitics in mind. It goes like this: The reason to fight for debt-free college \nor Medicare for all isn\u2019t just to improve life for Americans, but to build new \nground for progressive political activity. New programs create new \nconstituencies, and new programs with broad benefits can give more Americans a \nstake in the expansion and preservation of the welfare state. Conservatives know\n this. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve fought so hard to block or undermine even modest new \nprograms. Take the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which \nstands as the latest proof of the truth of that progressive theory. In its \noriginal form, the expansion relied on a significant bit of legislative \ncoercion. If states adopted it \u2014 and expanded Medicaid eligibility to up to 138 \npercent of the federal poverty line for virtually every adult \u2014 the federal \ngovernment would bear 100 percent of the cost for the first three years, phasing\n down to 90 percent of the cost over time. But if states refused, they wouldn\u2019t \njust lose this new funding \u2014 they would lose all existing federal Medicaid \nfunds. It was an offer states couldn\u2019t refuse, which \u2014 for Chief Justice John \nRoberts \u2014 made it unconstitutional. In his opinion for the majority in NFIB v. \nSebelius, he invalidated the penalty. States could refuse the expansion without \nlosing all Medicaid funding. A program intended to expand health insurance in \nevery state was now voluntary. By the time President Barack Obama left office in\n January 2017, 32 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid \nunder the Affordable Care Act. The holdouts were states where Republicans held \nenough power to either reject the expansion or keep a Democratic governor from \nimplementing the program. Future prospects looked poor. During the 2016 \npresidential campaign, Donald Trump had promised to repeal Obamacare. With \nRepublican majorities in the House and Senate, the incoming president was poised\n to do just that. But his plans unraveled. The legislative effort to torch \nObamacare ended in failure, sunk by key Republican defections (John McCain voted\n no in a critical, late night vote) and an intense, nationwide public outcry \ncentering on the Medicaid expansion. In Kentucky, where in 2014 the state\u2019s \nDemocratic governor Steve Beshear expanded Medicaid, voters turned out to defend\n the program, protesting against the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, \nand other Republican lawmakers. Republican lawmakers faced similar protests in \nPennsylvania and West Virginia, as well as at the Capitol itself. Medicaid also \nfueled an offensive drive. In 2015, Louisiana Democrats ran on Medicaid and won \nthe governor\u2019s mansion. In 2017, Virginia Democrats placed the Medicaid \nexpansion at the center of their campaign and swept the ballot, winning every \nstatewide office and fighting Republicans nearly to a tie in the state \nlegislature. Maine voters approved the Medicaid expansion in a 2017 ballot \ninitiative, but the Republican governor, Paul LePage, refused to implement it. \nIn her 2018 campaign to succeed LePage, the Democratic candidate, Janet Mills, \npledged to implement the expansion on her first day in office. She won and \nimmediately followed through. And last year, the fight to protect or expand \nMedicaid drove Democratic victories in Louisiana (where incumbent governor John \nBel Edwards won re-election), Kentucky (where the Democratic candidate Andy \nBeshear unseated the incumbent Republican governor, Matt Bevin) and Virginia \n(where Democrats won a majority in the state legislature for the first time \nsince 1993). Medicaid also helped Kansas Democrats win a 2018 election for \ngovernor, and on Thursday the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Laura Kelly, and its \nRepublican State Senate leader, Jim Denning, announced the details of their \ncompromise to expand the program. The state will implement the expansion, \ncovering up to 150,000 additional Kansans. In return, Republicans will get a \npilot program meant to reduce private health insurance premiums and keep people \nfrom dropping existing insurance and signing up for Medicaid, paid for an \nincrease in the state cigarette tax by a $1 per pack. The proposal would also \nallow the state to charge recipients a premium of up to $25 per individual and \n$100 per family. If and when it becomes law, Kansas will become the 37th state \nto expand its Medicaid program. Major new programs are difficult to pass. The \nstruggle to make them happen is almost always \u201cdivisive.\u201d But if you fight that \nfight and win, then in addition to passing the program, you\u2019ve also laid \ngroundwork for future political victories. Despite being undermined by the \nSupreme Court, the Medicaid expansion has found a toehold in American politics, \nproducing a powerful constituency for itself. The social safety net depends on \npublic support to survive. And one way to generate that support is to make it as\n strong and expansive as possible, with the most ambitious policies you can \nbring to fruition. Conservatives understand this in their bones. As Democrats \ndebate their choices and decide on a presidential nominee, they should also keep\n this lesson uppermost in their minds.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Facebook Loves to Pass the Buck Most of us fear that \nthe company will continue to take a hands-off approach to policing its platform.\n And that\u2019s exactly what it plans to do. By Kara Swisher Ms. Swisher covers \ntechnology and is a contributing opinion writer.  Nobody writes a blunderbuss of\n an internal post at an internet company without wanting it to be read widely \nand leaked, least of all a top executive at the most scrutinized company in \nSilicon Valley. Which is why the memo from Andrew Bosworth, a key adviser to \nFacebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, that somehow got out into the wild,\n is worth parsing. Dated Dec. 30, Mr. Bosworth\u2019s memo became public last week, \njust before Facebook announced how it will handle political advertising in this \npresidential election year.  In short, not much will change at Facebook; it will\n continue to have a hands-off approach to political ads. Facebook\u2019s plans, moves\n that were signaled in Mr. Bosworth\u2019s ruminations, boil down to one basic idea: \nDear consumer ensnared in our digital panopticon, you might want to fashion a \nhomemade shiv right about now because you are on your own in this prison of hate\n speech and dangerous lies we built.  Too harsh? I suppose I could give soft \nclaps to Facebook for tweaks to make its political ad storehouse more \ntransparent \u2014 a boon for those who have time to fuss with a complex dashboard \n(presumably the same folks who fix their own cars and such) \u2014 and for offering \ntools to let consumers see fewer of these ads (more do-it-yourself!). But this \nis the same tiresome ruse that Facebook leaders have used many times: pushing \naway responsibility for the ugly parts of their inventions onto the rest of us \nand conflating different, complex concepts \u2014 like paid ads versus free speech \u2014 \nin order to \u2026 well, I am not sure why.  And it\u2019s all perfumed with the faint \nodor of undeserved victimhood that Facebook executives apparently feel for being\n so maligned, even as they continue to benefit extravagantly from sucking all of\n our data into their maw, and even though they do less than they should to \ncontain some of the damage of social media that they are so clearly responsible \nfor. Mr. Bosworth, whose well-known nickname is Boz, personifies the most jolly \nversion of this, presenting himself through pugnacious and often amusing tweets \nas the blunt one at the company, ready to drop the real truth on the media and \nother critics. He delights in pointing out the small mistakes that journalists \nmake that undercut their larger and correct points about how Facebook has let \nsociety down by running the world\u2019s most important communications medium with \ntoo little care. Often, in his big bouillabaisse of words, he is a little right \nand a little wrong, making his pronouncements difficult to understand. His \nlatest post checked all these boxes, with a once-more-unto-the-breach tone as he\n assessed how to deal with the godlike power of the company going into the 2020 \npresidential election. Yes, Boz actually compared Facebook to a powerfully magic\n royal elf in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d series \u2014 in this case, Galadriel, who \nrefused to take the ring of all power because, while she might do good with it, \nshe might also eventually do evil. Dum, dum, dum! Thus, better to do nothing, as\n Boz wrote with a rather dramatic flourish, noting with faux-agony that he too \nwas bereft that Facebook helped President Trump achieve victory in 2016. But \nrather than acknowledge any manipulation of the platform by Russians, Boz argued\n \u2014 which is also now the gospel at Facebook \u2014 that Mr. Trump\u2019s success was all \ndue to his campaign\u2019s \u201cunbelievable work\u201d in using digital ad tools like a boss.\n Awe and then shock, I guess. \u201cAs a committed liberal I find myself desperately \nwanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result. So what stays\n my hand?\u201d wrote Boz, as if he were yielding Gandalf\u2019s Glamdring sword. \u201cI find \nmyself thinking of \u2018The Lord of the Rings\u2019 at this moment\u201d \u2014 specifically, he \nsaid, when Frodo offers the ring to Galadriel \u201cand she imagines using the power \nrighteously, at first, but knows it will eventually corrupt her. As tempting as \nit is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we \nmust never do that or we will become what we fear.\u201d Except that what most people\n fear is a Facebook that continues to take a hands-off approach to a platform \nthat always seems to be running amok somewhere, well beyond whatever \nmicrotargeted ads Mr. Trump\u2019s brilliant campaign staff runs.  Facebook\u2019s lack of\n significant action to police political ads is in contrast to recent moves by \nthe two other important platforms, which are either outright banning those ads \n(Twitter) or severely restricting how they are presented (Google). Facebook is \nthe only platform that really counts in this space, so what it has decided is \nwhat will be the oxygen of the 2020 race. There is a fair debate to have on the \nissue of microtargeting \u2014 which essentially allows for the slicing and dicing of\n a message into the tiniest bits, for potentially very narrow groups of users. \nSome feel microtargeting lets small and more marginalized political voices find \ntheir audience in a cost-effective way, since they cannot afford pricier mediums\n like television ads. Others think that microtargeting allows the powerful to \nplant millions of lies in the specific ears of the those who are easy to \nmanipulate. Both are true, but by not better policing the practice, Facebook \ncertainly creates an atmosphere of chaos, especially for those interested in \nmore transparent and truthful debate. Honesty may never be possible, according \nto Facebook, since the company has opted to keep allowing our elected officials \nto lie like a rug online. This is an astonishing abrogation of responsibility by\n the company, although if you have watched it do this same kind buck-passing \nover the years, it is no surprise. In a post defending Facebook\u2019s policy, Rob \nLeathern, the director of product management overseeing the advertising \nintegrity division, rehashed the approach to political ads: \u201cIn the absence of \nregulation, Facebook and other companies are left to design their own policies. \nWe have based ours on the principle that people should be able to hear from \nthose who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be \nscrutinized and debated in public.\u201d Leaving aside the fact that nothing can be \nheard any longer with all the noise Facebook has created, let me translate one \nbit of that for mere mortals who do not have the power Facebook wields with the \nglittering weapons it has also invented: It really means warts for all.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Neil Peart, Beyond the Gilded Cage Fans of Rush \nmarched to the beat of a different kind of drummer. By Bret Stephens Opinion \nColumnist Whenever I\u2019m walking in Midtown Manhattan, there are moments when a \nlyric written about 40 years ago runs through my mind. The buildings are lost / \nIn their limitless rise / My feet catch the pulse / And the purposeful stride. \nThe words are from the song \u201cThe Camera Eye,\u201d written by Neil Peart, the drummer\n and lyricist of the Canadian progressive-rock trio Rush. It\u2019s an 11-minute, \nB-side track from the band\u2019s best-known album, \u201cMoving Pictures.\u201d Along with \nother Rush classics like \u201c2112\u201d and \u201cPermanent Waves,\u201d I must have played it \nabout 10,000 times or so in high school. Not that this is the sort of thing \nthat, until news of Peart\u2019s death of a brain tumor broke last week, I would have\n easily admitted to anyone. LA Weekly once called Rush \u201cthe anchovies of rock \nmusic\u201d\u2014 loved by a select few, hated by many. Growing up, my friends listened to\n Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, the Steve Miller Band, Pink Floyd. To be a Rush fan in\n the 1980s had about as much social cachet as being treasurer of the math club. \nYet that was also what made the music so irresistible to me. Rush was rock for \nnerds, by nerds (and sometimes about nerds). You didn\u2019t dance to Rush. It wasn\u2019t\n heavy enough to bang your head to it or simple enough to tap your feet. You \nwould never play it at a party, or for a love interest, unless your goal was to \nbreak up. The music didn\u2019t set a mood, like Tears for Fears, or put you in the \nmood, like Roxy Music. What Rush\u2019s music did was compel attention. Songs \nunfurled in intricate, unexpected, subtle but cohesive patterns that always \nseemed to involve more instruments than the band had hands, fingers and feet to \nplay. Every member of Rush was a virtuoso, and sometimes the joy of the music \ncame in trying to focus on just one player: Geddy Lee\u2019s bass in the instrumental\n piece \u201cYYZ,\u201d or Alex Lifeson\u2019s guitar in \u201cLa Villa Strangiato,\u201d or Peart\u2019s \nthunderous drumming in the middle section of \u201cTom Sawyer.\u201d That\u2019s the section \nwhere, no matter where I am or what I\u2019m doing, my arms start air-drumming all by\n themselves. And then there were Rush\u2019s lyrics. Most pop songs are about love. \nMost heavy metal songs are about sex. Most country music seems to be about hard \nknocks and heartbreak. Peart\u2019s songs, by contrast, were about \u2014 anything else. \nHe wrote about suburban alienation (\u201cSubdivisions\u201d), the cosmological \nsignificance of tidal pools (\u201cNatural Science\u201d), metaphorical struggles for \nequality between oaks and maples (\u201cThe Trees\u201d) and a futuristic dystopia in \nwhich fast cars are banned by something called \u201cthe motor law\u201d (\u201cRed \nBarchetta\u201d). The themes were political, scientific, interpersonal, futuristic, \nphilosophical. My all-time favorite Rush lyric, \u201cI can\u2019t pretend a stranger / Is\n a long-awaited friend,\u201d is from the song \u201cLimelight,\u201d a meditation on the \ndecidedly mixed blessings of fame. I think of it every time I\u2019m asked to \nschmooze before a speech. No other band did this. None that I know of even came \nclose. To listen to Rush was to march to the beat \u2014 the complex beat \u2014 and the \neven more complex thoughts of a different kind of drummer. Pretentious? It could\n be, sometimes. But that did little to alter the experience of encountering the \nmusic as a teenager and feeling not just transfixed, but also understood by it. \nAt 46, I generally listen to music as a way of relaxing into my work. At 16, I \nwas trying to figure out who I was. Though Peart\u2019s themes and inspirations \nranged widely, the through-line for most of his songs was the struggle of \nbecoming, and the anxiety and marvel of being. Too many hands on my time / Too \nmany feelings, / Too many things on my mind. / When I leave I don\u2019t know what \nI\u2019m hoping to find. / And when I leave I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m leaving behind. \nThat\u2019s from the song \u201cThe Analog Kid.\u201d As a teenager going to a school 3,000 \nmiles from home, I felt as if it had been specifically written for me. It must \nhave seemed the same way for thousands of other kids my age, just trying to work\n out our place in the world. Implicit in the lyrics was the reassurance that the\n songwriter had been there before us, equally befuddled and afraid. And that it \nwould be O.K. Over years of going to Rush concerts, I always came away awed not \njust by the quality of the musicianship but also by the length of the shows: The\n band never seemed to want to give audiences anything but its full measure of \nappreciation. And while I was never any sort of groupie, I also watched more \nthan a few interviews with the band on the internet. The impression was always \nthe same: Here were three guys who had remained grounded, grateful, humble and \nsane. Another Rush discovery: Not every star has to be an awful person to be a \ngreat artist. For his 2013 induction speech at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, \nPeart quoted a line he attributed to Bob Dylan: \u201cThe highest purpose of art is \nto inspire. What else can you do for anyone but inspire them?\u201d The inspiration \ncontinues. Thanks to Neil Peart for helping so many of us find it.
