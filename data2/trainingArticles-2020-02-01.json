            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Requiem for a Dream Britain exits Europe. It will be \npoorer, above all in its shriveled heart. By Roger Cohen Opinion Columnist I \nhave covered many stories that marked me over the past 40 years, in war zones \nand outside them, but none that has affected me as personally as Britain\u2019s exit \nfrom the European Union. Brexit Day, now upon us, feels like the end of hope, a \nmoral collapse, a self-amputation that will make the country where I grew up \npoorer in every sense. Poorer materially, of course, but above all poorer in its\n shriveled soul, divorced from its neighborhood, internally fractured, smaller, \nmeaner, more insular, more alone, no longer a protagonist in the great miracle \nof the postwar years \u2014 Europe\u2019s journey toward borderless peace and union. \nBritain, in a fit of deluded jingoism, has opted for littleness. The fiasco was \ncaptured this week when that pompous and pitiful British nationalist, Nigel \nFarage, waved a miniature Union Jack in the European Parliament as he bid \nfarewell and was cut off by the vice-president of the Parliament, Mairead \nMcGuinness. \u201cPut your flags away, you\u2019re leaving, and take them with you,\u201d she \nsaid. Farage looked like a sheepish schoolboy caught breaking rules. He blushed.\n An Irish woman from a country uplifted by European Union membership \nreprimanding the new breed of little-England male as he exits history in pursuit\n of an illusion: the symbolism was perfect. \u201cHip, hip hooray!\u201d Farage\u2019s flag-\nwaving Brexit Party cohorts chanted. Save me, please, for I shall weep. Speaking\n of symbolism, the fact that President Trump has been a fulsome supporter of \nthis folly is apt. An ahistorical, amoral American leader cheering on a British \nabdication sums up the end of an era. The world was rebuilt after 1945 on \nsomething of more substance than British-American lies and bloviation; it took \nresolve. The torch has passed. To whom exactly is unclear, perhaps to a country \nslow to contain a plague. That is a problem. Brexit belongs to this era in one \nquintessential way. It is an act of the imagination, inspired by an imaginary \npast, carried along by misdirected grievances, borne aloft by an imaginary \nfuture. The age of impunity is also the age of illusion turbocharged by social \nmedia. Inequality, poor infrastructure, low investment, inadequate schools are \nreal British problems but the take-back-your-country transference of blame for \nthem onto \u201cBrussels bureaucrats\u201d proved that the imagination now overwhelms \nreality. Truth withers. The mob roars. This, too, is a problem. Yes, Britain was\n undefeated in World War II and helped liberate Europe. But it could do so only \nwith its allies; and it was precisely to secure what it is now turning its back \non: a free Europe offering its people the \u201csimple joys and hopes which make life\n worth living.\u201d Those are Churchill\u2019s words in 1946 in a speech that also \ncontained this phrase: \u201cWe must build a kind of United States of Europe.\u201d \nUnbowed Britain was once consequential Britain; no longer. I used the word \n\u201cabdication\u201d advisedly. Europe needs the great tradition of British liberalism \nat a moment when Hungary and Poland have veered toward nationalism and, across \nthe Continent, xenophobic hatred is resurgent. It is perverse for Britain to try\n to look away. Europe is part of Britain. Visit the great Norman monasteries in \nEngland and tell me this is not so. The British dead who lie in the Continent\u2019s \nsoil having given their lives for its liberty tell the same story of interlaced \nfate from a different perspective. To be so orphaned is painful. The 47 years of\n British membership cover the entire arc of my adult life. Europa was our dream.\n I covered Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian president, speaking to the European \nParliament about hope and peace in 1981, eight months before his assassination. \nSo much for dreams. Yet they persist, for otherwise life is unlivable. I \nwandered from Brussels to Rome to Paris to Berlin to London and everywhere I \nlived I experienced some iteration of Europe\u2019s beauty, as a physical thing, as a\n cultural bond and as a transformative idea. The sensation was most acute in \nGermany, where the idea of the union was the most effective escape from postwar \nshame and the rubble of 1945, a form of atonement. But it was ubiquitous, the \nguarantor of our deliverance and the symbol of our capacity to reinvent the \nworld and even make it better. Every European country, through the goal of ever \ncloser union, changed itself. They grew richer, no small thing. But they also \nreframed their self-image. Italy and Spain left Mussolini and Franco behind to \nbecome stable, prosperous democracies. France found its tortuous way to truth \nafter the humiliations and predations of Vichy and discovered a European avenue \nto express once more its universal message of human rights founded on human \ndignity. Central European countries stabilized their escape from the deadening \nSoviet imperium to which Yalta had confined them. Britain ceased equating Europe\n with scourges like intellectuals, rabies and garlic, as it had in my childhood.\n Hyde Park became a babble of European tongues. The British economy surged. \nBritain had given up its colonies and found a new identity in association with \nEurope, or so it seemed, flickeringly. Then I lived in Sarajevo covering the \nBosnian war and I saw, in inert bodies torn by shrapnel, and in history revived \nas galvanizing myth of might and conquest, the horror from which the European \nUnion had saved my generation. It had laid bad history to rest. That was enough \nto be forever a European patriot. But not enough for the British a quarter-\ncentury later. In the words of my friend Ed Vulliamy, who also covered that war,\n Britain has become a country \u201cthat boards cheap flights for stag outings to \npiss all over Krakow.\u201d Hip, hip hooray! When I lived in Berlin, I would cross \nthe nearby Polish border and never failed to marvel that where millions had \nperished decades earlier a nonexistent frontier traced its invisible line across\n fields of wheat. I would pass from the German world to the lands of the Slavs \nand nobody asked me who I was, what papers I bore or what was my intent. If \nGerman-Polish reconciliation has been possible, anything is possible, my only \nsolace at this moment. A bunch of flag-waving fantasists, at the wrong end of \nactuarial tables, have robbed British youth of the Europe they embrace. They \nwill be looking on as 450 million Europeans across the way forge their fate. \nTheir automatic right to live and work anywhere from Lisbon to Stockholm will be\n lost. I\u2019ve lost a limb; more than a limb, my heart. Europe helped Britain grow \nbigger and more open and more prosperous. Now it will shrink. Another suffering \nfriend, Patrick Wintour, the diplomatic editor of The Guardian, sent me these \nlines of Auden: In the nightmare of the dark All the dogs of Europe bark, And \nthe living nations wait, Each sequestered in its hate; Intellectual disgrace \nStares from every human face, And the seas of pity lie Locked and frozen in each\n eye. A better epitaph for the aborted story of Britain in Europe and the \ntragedy of a disoriented nation\u2019s willful infliction of enduring self-harm is \nimpossible to imagine.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Bernie\u2019s Angry Bros The Sanders online army resembles\n President Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters in more ways than either side might \ncare to admit. By Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist Barbara Boxer minces no words \nwhen it comes to describing the people usually known as the Bernie Bros \u2014 a \nsubset of Bernie Sanders supporters who hope to take over the Democratic Party \nand remake it in their image. \u201cThere is so much negative energy; it\u2019s so angry,\u201d\n says the former four-term Democratic senator from California. \u201cYou can be angry\n about the unfairness in the world. But this becomes a personal, deep-seated \nanger at anyone who doesn\u2019t say exactly what you want to hear.\u201d I ran into Boxer\n earlier this week and got to talking about a superb report in The Times by my \ncolleagues Matt Flegenheimer, Rebecca R. Ruiz and Nellie Bowles: \u201cBernie Sanders\n and His Internet Army.\u201d The piece briefly mentions a 2016 incident in which \nBoxer went to Nevada to try to unify the party after Hillary Clinton defeated \nBernie Sanders in the state\u2019s caucus. Boxer was an early Clinton supporter. But \nshe\u2019s also a liberal lioness and felt sure she could mollify the crowd. \u201cI \nthought I could get the booing down,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018Why are you \nbooing? I\u2019m Bernie\u2019s friend. When you boo me, you\u2019re booing Bernie.\u2019 \u201d Things \nonly got worse. The heckling got louder. Someone picked up a chair as if to \nthrow it. \u201cSecurity whispers in my ear, you\u2019ve got to get off the stage,\u201d Boxer \nsaid. \u201cWhen I left, my heart was pounding. I\u2019d never had that before.\u201d Boxer\u2019s \nstory is one of the milder ones The Times tells about the Internet trolls whose \ngoals seem to have less to do with building Sanders up than with hounding and \nhumiliating anyone who stands in their man\u2019s way. \u201cWhen Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters\n swarm someone online, they often find multiple access points to that person\u2019s \nlife, compiling what can amount to investigative dossiers,\u201d The Times reported. \n\u201cMore commonly, there is a barrage of jabs and threats sometimes framed as \njokes. If the target is a woman, and it often is, these insults can veer toward \nher physical appearance.\u201d Does this mean Sanders himself supports this kind of \nbehavior? No, and occasionally he tries to disavow it. But not very hard: Last \nyear, he hired as a top aide and speechwriter David Sirota, accurately described\n by The Atlantic as \u201chis Twitter attack dog.\u201d Nor does it mean that anything \nlike a majority of Sanders\u2019s supporters support the nastiness carried out in his\n name. Yet no other Democratic candidate has so many venomous followers \u2014 no \nBiden Brothers or Warren Sisters to return fire with fire. The only real analog \nin U.S. politics today to the Bernie nasties are the Trump nasties. They \nresemble each other in ways neither side cares to admit. The most obvious \nresemblance is the adulation they bestow on their respective champions, whom \nthey treat less as normal politicians than as saviors who deserve uncritical and\n uncompromising support. \u201cSurrender to a leader is not a means to an end but a \nfulfillment,\u201d the philosopher Eric Hoffer observed in \u201cThe True Believer,\u201d a \nbook that remains as relevant in our populist era as it was in the totalitarian \none. \u201cWhither they are led is of secondary importance.\u201d Since it\u2019s the usual \ndestiny of saviors to be persecuted before they\u2019re exalted, the response of \ntheir followers often is to persecute back. But persecute whom? In the \ndemonology of most mass movements there is usually a near enemy and a far one, \nand the near enemy must be dealt with first and hardest. To this day, hard-core \nTrump supporters reserve their deepest spite for Republican NeverTrump holdouts \n(\u201chuman scum,\u201d according to the president). Just so with the Bernie Bros, who \nsee more moderate Democrats not as kindred spirits or potential converts but as \nsellouts, even traitors \u2014 the proverbial enemy within. Partly this is about the \nnormal competition for power, in which the show of ideological purity is treated\n as evidence of moral superiority. But it also goes to the heart of what the \nBernie Bros are really about. As they see it, ordinary civility isn\u2019t a virtue. \nIt\u2019s a ruse by which those with power manipulate and marginalize those without. \nDemocrats like Joe Biden who play by the rules of civility and bipartisanship \naren\u2019t just falling prey to the insidious manipulation. They are perpetrating \nand legitimizing it. No wonder nearly half of Sanders\u2019s supporters won\u2019t commit \nto or are unsure about voting for the Democratic nominee in the event it isn\u2019t \nBernie, according to a recent poll. Why bother voting for Oligarchy Lite? If \nthere is a silver lining here, it\u2019s that the world has long experience with this\n brand of zealotry. Bernie Sanders may not be one of his own awful Bros, and may\n condemn their worst excesses. But there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019ll lose their\n influence should he win the White House \u2014 just as Trump\u2019s presidency has \nemboldened and empowered many of his own worst followers. Is this the Democratic\n Party the Democrats want? They will cast their first votes for president on \nMonday evening at the party caucuses in Iowa. Now is the moment for second \nthoughts.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Trump, Unrepentant and Unleashed The diabolical duo \nof Donald and Mitch, serving their own interests, not the national one. By \nMaureen Dowd Opinion Columnist WASHINGTON \u2014 During a meeting with Donald Trump \nat Trump Tower in June of 2016, with the op\u00e9ra bouffe builder improbably heading\n toward the nomination despite a skeletal campaign crew on a floor below, I \nasked when he would pivot. We all assumed he would have to pivot, that he would \nhave to stop his belittling Twitter rants, that he would have to cease attacking\n fellow Republicans like John McCain, that he would have to get more in line \nwith the traditional stances of his party, that he would have to be less of a \nbarbarian at the gates of D.C. He crossed his arms, pursed his lips and shook \nhis head \u2014 a child refusing vegetables. How na\u00efve he was, I thought to myself. \nBut I was the na\u00efve one. Trump has forced the world to pivot to him. The state \nof the union is upside down and inside out and sauerkraut. Trump has changed \nliterally everything in the last three years, transforming and coarsening the \ngame. On Friday night, he became, arguably, the most brutishly powerful \nRepublican of all time. Never has a leader had such a stranglehold on his party,\n subsuming it with one gulp. As the Senate voted 51 to 49 to smother the \nimpeachment inquiry, guided by the dark hand of Mitch McConnell, it felt like \nthe world\u2019s greatest deliberative body had been hollowed out, diminished. \nMcConnell let Mitt Romney and Susan Collins vote to allow documents and \nwitnesses such as John Bolton, knowing two could strain at the leash safely. The\n rest of the senators fell into line as sycophantic clones of Mike Pence. The \nimpeachment trial amounted to one side being earnest and one pretending to be. \nIt was exactly what Nancy Pelosi feared would happen before she was reluctantly \ndrawn into the show trial. \u201cNow the State of the Union is going to be the Stay \nPuft Marshmallow Man coming down the street and standing in the rubble of what\u2019s\n left of the Congress,\u201d keened one Democrat on Friday night. \u201cThe Republican \nParty has now lost whatever control they could exert over this president, any \noversight they could have. It\u2019s gone. The state of the union is there is no \nunion. How can there be, when one side is petrified of their Godzilla?\u201d Senator \nChris Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat, dismissed Republicans as \u201ca cult of \npersonality\u201d around Trump. \u201cThis trial in so many ways crystallized the \ncompletely diametrically opposed threats that Democrats and Republicans see to \nthe country,\u201d Murphy told The Times\u2019s Nicholas Fandos. \u201cWe perceive Donald Trump\n and his corruption to be an existential threat to the country. They perceive \nthe deep state and the liberal media to be an existential threat to the country.\n \u201cThat dichotomy, that contrast, has been growing over the last three years, but\n this trial really crystallized that difference. We were just speaking different\n languages, fundamentally different languages when it came to what this trial \nwas about. They thought it was about the deep state and the media conspiracy. We\n thought it was about the president\u2019s crimes.\u201d I feel like I have spent my \ncareer watching the same depressing dynamic that unspooled Friday night: \nDemocrats trying, sometimes ineptly, to play fair and Republicans ruthlessly \ntrying to win. I watched it with the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings. I \nwatched it in the 2000 recount with Bush versus Gore. I watched it with the push\n by W., Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld to go to war in Iraq. I watched it with \nthe pantomime of Merrick Garland. Democrats are warning Republicans that they \nwill be judged harshly by history. But in the meantime, the triumphant \nRepublicans get to make history. And a lot of the history that Republicans have \nmade is frightening: the endless, futile wars, the obliviousness to climate \nchange, the stamp on the judiciary. As Carl Hulse writes in his book, \n\u201cConfirmation Bias,\u201d about the Garland fiasco: \u201cThe success in naming judges was\n the signal achievement of Trump\u2019s first two years. In the coming years, those \njudges will be among the members of the federal bench called to rule on Trump\u2019s \npolicies and practices in cases arising from challenges initiated by \nincreasingly confrontational Democrats and other legal adversaries around the \nnation. Mitch McConnell made a snap decision one night in 2016. The consequences\n will reverberate for decades.\u201d For hours on Friday, the House managers made \ntheir vain final arguments. Pressing for Bolton\u2019s testimony, Val Demings \nimplored Republican senators: Aren\u2019t you worried that, if left in office, Trump \nwill harm America\u2019s national security, seek to corrupt the upcoming election and\n undermine our democracy to further his own personal gain? Don\u2019t you want to \nhear the witnesses and see the documents that would give the full story and make\n this a fair trial rather than a mock one? \u201cThis is the American way and this is\n the American story,\u201d Demings told the Republican senators as they looked back \nat her, impassive or impatient. But, of course, they didn\u2019t want that. As he \nvoted against witnesses and documents, Lamar Alexander, McConnell\u2019s pal, said \nTrump did something inappropriate but they just did not accept that it was \nimpeachable, and they did not want to tear up ballots and \u201cpour gasoline on \ncultural fires that are burning out there.\u201d So why not shut it down and cover it\n up? The books were cooked from the start. As with so many other pivotal moments\n in modern history, Republicans wanted to win, not look for the truth. And \nhistory, God help us, is written by the winners. The Times is committed to \npublishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Mayor Pete\u2019s Gay Reckoning Win or lose in Iowa, \nButtigieg has challenged and changed America. By Frank Bruni Opinion Columnist \nANKENY, Iowa \u2014 You can listen to long stretches of Pete Buttigieg\u2019s remarks and \nhear little or no reference to the trailblazing nature of his campaign. You can \nalmost forget. But as he wrapped up a rally here on Thursday night, with the \nclock ticking down fast to the Iowa caucuses, he made soaring, stirring mention \nof it. You remembered. \u201cIowa has a remarkable knack for making history,\u201d he told\n hundreds of supporters, noting that he\u2019d initially visited the state to support\n Barack Obama during the Democratic primary in 2008, when Obama\u2019s Iowa victory \nset him on his way. \u201cYou changed America\u2019s \u2014 and the world\u2019s \u2014 expectations for \nwhat was possible.\u201d Then he alluded to Iowa\u2019s legalization of gay marriage in \n2009, six years before that happened nationally, and how it gave him hope that \nhe might someday \u201cbe a happily married man.\u201d The crowd roared. I had one foot \nout the door \u2014 it had been a long, long day \u2014 and I stopped in my tracks. As a \ngay man and an American, I felt a surge of pride. It\u2019s do-or-die time for \nButtigieg, whose poll numbers recently have been moving in the wrong direction. \nHe probably needs to finish first or a very strong second on Monday to preserve \nany shot to be his party\u2019s 2020 nominee. He needs neither to claim an enormous \naccomplishment. Win or lose, Buttigieg is the first openly gay American to \nbecome a serious presidential candidate, one who landed on the covers of \nprominent magazines, was fawned over on the most-watched television talk shows, \nraised exponentially more money than any of the governors in the race, outpaced \nBeto O\u2019Rourke, outpolled Kamala Harris, caught President Trump\u2019s attention, \nqualified for all of the Democratic debates and more than held his own in each \nof them. Win or lose, he\u2019s an example, an education and a hell of a story. That \nnarrative is about youth \u2014 he just turned 38 \u2014 and the power of hyper-\narticulateness in an era of presidential crudeness. But it\u2019s also about sexual \norientation, which has and hasn\u2019t factored into his pitch in surprising ways. He\n has grappled, on the national political stage, with questions that all \nL.G.B.T.Q. people ask, so that his candidacy is a metaphor for our lives: To \nwhat extent am I defined by my sexual orientation or gender identity? What does \nand doesn\u2019t it tell you about me? Buttigieg\u2019s answers have disappointed some \nL.G.B.T.Q. people \u2014 and were bound to, given the expectations placed on any \npolitician who is blessed and cursed to become a symbol. Female candidates have \nhad experiences similar to his; candidates of color, too. These pioneers are \nexhorted to open doors closed to the groups they represent but to represent \nthose groups first and foremost, and that\u2019s tough. Check with Obama. Or Hillary \nClinton. Or, now, Buttigieg. He has weathered complaints, even derision, from \nL.G.B.T.Q. progressives, many of whom say he\u2019s not gay enough, his manner and \nmannerisms too strait-laced, his policy preoccupations too moderate, his success\n infuriatingly reflective of how readily and well he assimilates into \nheterosexual America. \u201cGays Seem to Be Mayor Pete\u2019s Worst Critics\u201d was the \nheadline of a column in The Washington Blade, an L.G.B.T.Q. publication. That \nsaddens me. As I\u2019ve written before, part of what so many gay people have fought \nso hard for is the recognition that we don\u2019t fit into tidy boxes, otherwise \nknown as stereotypes \u2014 not sartorially, not ideologically. Absolutely disagree \nwith Buttigieg\u2019s opposition to \u201cMedicare for all\u201d if you have a different view, \nbut don\u2019t suggest that he should support it because he\u2019s gay. Yawn at all those \nperfectly pressed white dress shirts that he wears, but don\u2019t cast them as a \nbetrayal. And don\u2019t say that by discussing his own Christianity, he\u2019s consorting\n with the enemy. Yes, religion has been used cruelly against L.G.B.T.Q. people. \nBut one of the most profound dimensions of Buttigieg\u2019s candidacy is how he has \nturned that around, for instance asserting that his marriage to his husband, \nChasten, has brought him \u201ccloser to God.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that I wish the Mike\n Pences of the world would understand,\u201d he said in a speech last year, referring\n to the vice president\u2019s anti-gay record. \u201cThat if you have a problem with who I\n am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\u201d \nButtigieg has campaigned frequently with his husband, embracing him onstage, and\n has mentioned his marriage in debates. And he doesn\u2019t shy away from questions \nabout his sexual orientation, which he didn\u2019t publicly acknowledge until the age\n of 33, shortly before his election to a second term as mayor of South Bend, \nInd. But he doesn\u2019t volunteer lengthy ruminations about its impact on how he \nsees the world or showcase it in any other way. It\u2019s there if you look and \nlisten for it. But sometimes you have to look and listen hard. None of the \nvoters at his rallies in Iowa brought it up when I asked them what drew them to \nButtigieg. They mostly raved about his intelligence. Were there any particular \nobstacles he might face in a general election? \u201cHis youth,\u201d said Louann Cooling,\n 62, of Le Grand, Iowa. It was the same answer \u2014 his youth, or his inexperience \n\u2014 that others gave. No one mentioned his being openly gay. Being gay and an \nemblem of progress hasn\u2019t given Buttigieg any special traction with younger \nDemocrats, who respond much less favorably to him than older Democrats do. It \nhasn\u2019t established any solidarity with other minorities, though he reached for \nsuch a connection when stating a commitment to racial justice during the \nDemocrats\u2019 November debate. \u201cWhile I do not have the experience of ever having \nbeen discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the \nexperience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on \nthe news and seeing my own rights come up for debate,\u201d he said. \u201cWearing this \nwedding ring in a way that couldn\u2019t have happened two elections ago lets me know\n just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every\n day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.\u201d Those remarks \ndidn\u2019t have the effect he intended. Some African-Americans accused him of \nequating very different kinds of discrimination, and polls show that his support\n from black Democrats remains abysmal. When they appraise Buttigieg, they notice\n a whole lot beyond his sexual orientation, including worrisome friction between\n him and some black residents of South Bend and a path of extraordinary \nprivilege (Harvard, a Rhodes scholarship, a job with McKinsey) that brought him \nto this point. What does Buttigieg\u2019s being gay tell you? That he has trepidation\n and caution in him \u2014 he stayed in the closet all those years \u2014 but that he has \ncourage, too, enough to pursue the presidency despite the inevitable spotlight \non him as a novelty. What doesn\u2019t his being gay tell you? His musical tastes, \nfor one. The last time I had a long talk with him was in mid-December, and he \nhad just met the performer Lizzo, who was a fellow guest on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d \nShe\u2019s an icon for outsiders, brimming with delicious attitude, and I assumed \nhe\u2019d be thrilled. But I\u2019m not sure he really does \u201cthrilled,\u201d and he confessed \nto being more a Dave Matthews Band fan. In any case, he said, \u201cI usually have a \nkind of celebrity blindness.\u201d A gay man who doesn\u2019t twinkle at the stars around \nhim? Yep, our creator makes us in all shapes and stripes.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by She Helped a Customer in Need. Then U.S. Bank Fired \nHer. This from a company that says employees should \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d By \nNicholas Kristof Opinion Columnist To understand how some companies have lost \ntheir souls, consider what happened after U.S. Bank stiffed a customer before \nChristmas. Marc Eugenio had deposited a $1,080 paycheck into his account at U.S.\n Bank. The bank put a hold on most of the sum, and he spent many hours in a \nbranch office over two days, trying to get access to the money so he could buy \npresents for his 9-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son. On Christmas Eve, \nEugenio found himself parked at a gas station in Clackamas, Ore., a Portland \nsuburb, both his fuel gauge and his bank balance on empty. A bank employee had \ntold him that money would soon show up in his account \u2014 perhaps a ruse to get \nhim out of the branch office. For hours Eugenio then tried his debit card at the\n gas pump, so he could buy a few gallons and get home to his wife and children. \n\u201cI was stranded,\u201d he told me. \u201cI could have walked home, but it would have been \nfive miles in the cold.\u201d That\u2019s when Eugenio found an angel. He telephoned the \nbank\u2019s toll-free number and spoke with Emily James, a senior officer at a call \ncenter in Portland. She spent an hour on the phone with Eugenio, trying to get \nsome money released so he could at least get home. She soon realized that he had\n been misled, and that money wouldn\u2019t reach his account any time soon. Feeling \nbad for a customer stuck on Christmas Eve, James offered to drive over from her \ncall center and personally hand him $20. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Eugenio told her. He \ncouldn\u2019t impose. But she suggested she could use her break, and she received \npermission from a supervisor to drive 20 minutes to Eugenio. She later recalled \nthat when she arrived, she wished him Merry Christmas and handed him $20 of her \nown money. \u201cTwenty dollars wouldn\u2019t break me,\u201d she explained to me, \u201cand it \nwould enable him to get home to his family.\u201d When U.S. Bank found out that it \nhad such a generous employee, what did it do? It fired her. \u201cShe broke the \nrules, putting herself and the bank at unnecessary risk,\u201d U.S. Bank said in a \nstatement. The company bars call center workers from meeting customers, so it \ndismissed both her and the manager who had approved her trip. The manager, \nAbigail Gilbert, told me that James\u2019s account was essentially correct. James had\n worked at the bank since 2017 and had received numerous commendations and \nawards that I examined, but the bank paid her no severance. She is single and \nused her last paycheck to buy sacks of food for her two dogs, Domino and Harley \nQuinn. She is now reduced to selling blood plasma, at $25 a visit. \u201cI won\u2019t let \nmyself be homeless,\u201d she told me. Eugenio is horrified at what happened. \u201cI was \nlied to and treated like dirt\u201d by the bank, Eugenio said, and he can\u2019t \nunderstand why the bank axed the one employee who was helpful. \u201cI felt really \nbad,\u201d he told me. \u201cHow could she get fired?\u201d U.S. Bank\u2019s vision statement \nboasts: \u201cOur employees are empowered to do the right thing.\u201d So I tried to ask \nthe company\u2019s C.E.O., Andrew Cecere, why the bank fired an employee who, with \npermission, rescued a frustrated customer on Christmas Eve. Cecere wouldn\u2019t \nreturn my calls. David Palombi, a bank spokesman, told me that an internal \n\u201cinvestigation\u201d had concluded that James misled her manager to get permission, \nthat James could have found other ways to get money to Eugenio, that the $20 \ncame from the manager (which Gilbert confirmed to me) and that James previously \nhad disciplinary \u201cissues.\u201d I found the bank\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d a whitewash and \nits explanations to be incoherent, meanspirited and contradicted by a series of \ninternal bank messages that I reviewed. The bottom line is this: Cecere, who was\n paid $14.1 million in 2018, presides over a company that has smeared a much-\ndecorated employee who helped a customer and as a result survives by selling \nblood plasma. I suggest Cecere apologize, reinstate James and promote her; he \nmight also show contrition by selling his own blood plasma and donating the \nproceeds to a charity of James\u2019s choosing. When young Americans say in polls \nthat they react more positively to \u201csocialism\u201d than to \u201ccapitalism,\u201d it\u2019s \nbecause of the hypocrisy of institutions like U.S. Bank. I\u2019ve often noted that \ncompanies have enormous capacity to help their communities. But too often they \nact like American tobacco companies, which killed more people than Stalin did, \nor pharma companies peddling opioids, or McKinsey & Company advising a business \nto \u201cget more patients on higher doses of opioids,\u201d or Boeing mocking regulators.\n That\u2019s one reason to seek stronger private-sector labor unions: At least unions\n and corporations can then provide some check on each other. One bit of \nreassurance: Some chief executives do seem more enlightened than Cecere. After \nThe Oregonian wrote two excellent articles about James, other companies reached \nout to her, saying that she\u2019s the kind of caring person they want to attract. \n\u201cNo job offers yet,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut there are a couple of possibilities I\u2019m \nreally excited by.\u201d Update: On Saturday evening, after this article went online,\n I had a contrite phone call from Andrew Cecere, the C.E.O. of U.S. Bank. \u201cThis \nis not who we are,\u201d he said. He added that companies sometimes make mistakes, \nand that he accepted ownership of what went wrong. He also telephoned Emily \nJames and expressed concern for her and for her supervisor, Abigail Gilbert. \u201cI \nwill fix this,\u201d he told me.
