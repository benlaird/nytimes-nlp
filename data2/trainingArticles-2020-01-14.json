This article is part of the \nDebatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and \nThursdays. If, as an awards show, you were looking to start a controversy, you \nmight start by nominating only male directors for the second year in a row, \nwhile also taking special care to pass over every actor of color except the one \nwho played Harriet Tubman.  Behold, this year\u2019s Oscars: On Monday, The Times \nreported, \u201cthe 9,000-member Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences largely \nmaintained its traditional point of view, handing out the most nominations to \nfour very male, very white movies,\u201d excluding what The Times\u2019s awards season \ncolumnist Kyle Buchanan called \u201csome of the most exciting performances and films\n of the season.\u201d What started out as a diverse pool of candidates is now just \nanother fight between a bunch of white people. I could be talking about the \nDemocratic race or the Oscars. It's universal! Naturally, the list drew \nconsiderable criticism, but also some limited praise. Here\u2019s what movie critics \nare saying.  \u2018It Could Be Worse!\u2019 Six of the nine movies nominated for best \npicture are almost entirely about white men, but there\u2019s an upside to that, \nwrites The Washington Post\u2019s Alyssa Rosenberg. Yes, it\u2019s a shame that the \nvoters\u2019 preferences are so narrow. (Four years into its diversification effort, \nthe academy remains 68 percent male and 84 percent white.) But this year\u2019s \nselections at least offer welcome attempts at \u201csorting masculinity out,\u201d as she \nputs it, which, under patriarchy, is \u201can important thing to do if we want to \nmake everyone else safer.\u201d Not all of the films nominated do so in ways that are\n artistically satisfying, she argues. While \u201cThe Joker\u201d ran away with the most \nnominations, \u201c1917,\u201d \u201cFord v Ferrari\u201d and \u201cThe Irishman\u201d are far more \ninteresting, partly because they are \u201cabout men trying, and in some cases \nfailing, to be good.\u201d It would be nice if the academy showed the same interest \nin the inner lives of women and people of color, Ms. Rosenberg writes. But until\n then, \u201cthe academy could do worse than to nominate movies that at least show \nsome skepticism about men, instead of taking their heroism and morality for \ngranted.\u201d [Related: What Is a White Man Mad About in This Oscar-Nominated \nMovie?] It\u2019s easy, and dangerous, to overnarrativize the Oscar nominations, \nwrites Mark Harris in Vanity Fair. This year\u2019s nominations are no more \ndispositive of some cultural defeat than the 2017 Oscar season, during which \nseven actors of color were nominated, was dispositive of victory.  \u201cSetbacks \ncertainly give comfort to reactionary elements that exist quietly within the \nacademy and more loudly outside of it \u2014 people who want any excuse to argue what\n they\u2019ve been arguing for years and years on many fronts, which is that \ndiversity efforts constitute both special pleading and an exercise in futility. \nThey are, of course, neither,\u201d he writes.  And there are some bright spots: \nMartin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Irishman\u201d \u2014 \u201ca masterpiece,\u201d in Mr. Harris\u2019s view \u2014 \nreceived 10 nominations, and Bong Joon-ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d became the first South \nKorean film to get nominations for best director and best picture. \u201cAll he had \nto do was make the year\u2019s best movie,\u201d Mr. Harris tweeted.  \u2018Does the Academy \nThink \u201cLittle Women\u201d Directed Itself?\u2019 The Oscar nominations should be thrown \ninto the fireplace for the academy\u2019s refusal to recognize female directors, \nwrites Dana Stevens, Slate\u2019s movie critic. This year saw an abundance of \ncritically acclaimed movies directed by women, including Lulu Wang\u2019s \u201cThe \nFarewell,\u201d Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLittle Women,\u201d Mati Diop\u2019s \u201cThe Atlantics,\u201d C\u00e9line \nSciamma\u2019s \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire,\u201d Lorene Scafaria\u2019s \u201cHustlers\u201d and \nChinonye Chukwu\u2019s \u201cClemency.\u201d  \u201cLittle Women\u201d received six nominations, \nincluding for best actor (Saoirse Ronan), best supporting actor (Florence Pugh),\n best picture and best adapted screenplay, which Ms. Gerwig wrote. But Ms. \nGerwig herself got no recognition for direction. \u201cThe Farewell,\u201d which had \nfigured prominently in the front-runner conversation, was shut out of the awards\n entirely.  \u201cTo respond to a year like that with the studious exclusion of any \none female from the award that above all others confers authorship and \nauthority, the one that attributes a film\u2019s success to the unifying vision of an\n individual, starts to look like nothing else but rank condescending sexism,\u201d \nMs. Stevens writes. \u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable, disheartening, and thoroughly \nembarrassing,\u201d writes Laura Bradley at Vanity Fair. \u201cOnly one woman, Kathryn \nBigelow, has ever won best director \u2014 and that was now a decade ago.\u201d Ms. \nGerwig\u2019s omission is \u201cscandalous,\u201d writes Richard Brody at The New Yorker. \u201cI \ndon\u2019t think that her direction of the movie is literally among the year\u2019s five \nbest achievements in the field,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut it\u2019s pretty close, and it\u2019s far\n superior to that of all the nominees except Scorsese.\u201d Alexandra Schwartz, also\n at The New Yorker, tweeted: \u2018It\u2019s not quite #OscarsSoWhite, but it\u2019s close \nenough\u2019 Where are all the actors of color? asks Yohana Desta at Vanity Fair. \nNineteen out of 20 actors nominated are white, the lone exception being Cynthia \nErivo for Kasi Lemmons\u2019s \u201cHarriet.\u201d Conspicuously absent were Jennifer Lopez, \nthe entire cast of \u201cParasite\u201d and Awkwafina, whose performance in \u201cThe Farewell\u201d\n won a Golden Globe. \u201cThe surprise is not the lack of diversity itself,\u201d Ms. \nDesta writes. \u201cRather, it\u2019s the academy\u2019s sheer audacity to opt for a nearly \nall-white slate (again!), despite the fact that nearly a dozen actors of color \nhave been a serious part of this year\u2019s awards-season conversation.\u201d The \nacademy\u2019s choice not to nominate Ms. Lopez for \u201cHustlers\u201d dispels the \u201cillusion \nof inclusion in relation to Latinx people\u201d that has recently permeated \nHollywood, Carlos Aguilar writes in The Times. (In his review of \u201cHustlers,\u201d \nA.O. Scott, The Times\u2019s chief film critic, called Ms. Lopez\u2019s performance a \n\u201cfinely calibrated,\u201d \u201cincandescent one-woman spectacle\u201d that in some ways \noutshone the movie.)  But even more dispiriting than Ms. Lopez\u2019s snub itself, \nMr. Aguilar writes, are its implications for Latinx representation in the \nindustry more broadly.  He notes that in the academy\u2019s 92-year history, only a \nhandful of American-born Latinx actors have ever been nominated for the highest \nacting honors. Ms. Lopez would have been the first American Latina actress to \nget a nod since Rosie Perez in 1994.  The few Latin American actresses who have \nbeen shortlisted in recent memory played characters exhibiting \u201cfamiliar \ntropes,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s noteworthy about Ms. Lopez\u2019s turn is that it does not \nabide by preconceived and clich\u00e9d expectations of who a Latinx woman is, \nspecifically one born and raised in the United States,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhat does it\n mean that this type of Latinx character \u2014 not a maid, not a drug mule, not a \nnanny \u2014 wasn\u2019t acknowledged by the academy?\u201d A version of that question has also\n been asked about Lupita Nyong\u2019o, who won for best supporting actress in 2014 \nfor her portrayal of Patsey in \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d but whose mirrored \nperformance in Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cUs\u201d (\u201cdazzling,\u201d according to The Times; \n\u201cvirtuosic,\u201d according to The New Yorker) went unrecognized this year.  \u201cIt \nlegitimizes this idea that black stories must revolve around sorrow and loss in \norder to be seen as important,\u201d says Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n at Vulture, who \ncalled Ms. Erivo\u2019s \u201cHarriet\u201d performance \u201cstunningly forgettable.\u201d  Cassie da \nCosta, an entertainment writer for The Daily Beast, tweeted: Do you have \nthoughts about the Oscars or work that went unrecognized?

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The conversation How Does President Sanders Sound to \nYou? Bernie is surging and may have found his moment. By Gail Collins and Bret \nStephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse \nevery other week. Bret Stephens: Hi, Gail. I\u2019ve been coming around to the view \nthat Bernie Sanders could really win the Democratic nomination and the \npresidency, and the numbers show it. A poll released last week by The Des Moines\n Register and CNN gives him the lead in Iowa, and he\u2019s in strong contention for \nNew Hampshire. His fund-raising is just extraordinary: more than $34 million \nlast quarter, raised mostly in very small donations. Do you see him winning the \nnomination? And how does \u201cPresident Sanders\u201d sound to you? Gail Collins: \nDefinitely better than \u201cPresident Trump.\u201d He\u2019s not my favorite Democrat, but \nwhat I\u2019m looking for now is anybody who can win and get us out of this \nnightmare. If you told me Sanders is a guy you\u2019d vote for, I would certainly be \nimpressed. Come on \u2014 give me your appraisal. Bret: O.K. Here goes: I could never\n vote for Sanders. Joe Biden? Sure. Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar? Gladly. \nMike Bloomberg? Enthusiastically. They are all middle-of-the-road Democrats who \nwould restore honor to the White House and sanity to the country, and maybe even\n teach Republicans a valuable lesson in the perils of embracing a demagogue. But\n while I would never cast a ballot for Donald Trump, there\u2019s no chance I\u2019d vote \nfor either Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Gail: We have a disagreement! Bret: Long\n overdue! Gail: I understand that Sanders and Warren have economic principles \nthat you most definitely do not share. But they\u2019re reasonable human beings who \ncould represent the presidency to the nation and the world without causing us to\n hang our heads in shame. Bret: I might say that about President Warren. Not \nPresident Find-the-Silver-Lining-in-Fidel-Castro Sanders. Gail: Once upon a \ntime, Sanders actually had a good record of getting bipartisan support for his \nlegislation. And it\u2019s not as if he\u2019d be able to walk into the White House and \nimpose democratic socialism. Remember that Obama, who ran on the idea of \nnational health care, could barely get a much smaller, flawed version through a \nCongress he theoretically controlled. Bret: Trump also has been able to get only\n a fraction of his agenda through Congress. The wall with Mexico is largely \nunbuilt. We still take in hundreds of thousands of immigrants every year, \nincluding from majority-Muslim countries (though the numbers are declining). Our\n sanctions on Russia are still in place, and we haven\u2019t abandoned NATO. But I \nstill wish Trump had never been elected in the first place. Gail: We\u2019ll agree on\n that forever. Bret: Let\u2019s assume President Sanders got just one-third of his \nagenda through Congress. What would that mean? Dramatic cuts in defense spending\n that would leave us and our allies even more vulnerable to Russian or Chinese \naggression. One or two huge new government spending programs that would weigh on\n fiscal balance sheets for generations. Punitive tax increases on billionaires, \nwho have the means and the savvy to move their assets offshore, and major tax \nhikes on people who aren\u2019t anywhere near as rich, and who can\u2019t avoid taxes. \nDeclining incentives for investment; ever-growing incentives for political \ncorruption as a way of gaining favors from the state. On the plus side, however,\n we\u2019d be seeing much more of Larry David on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Gail: Or \u2026 it\n would mean a turnaround on the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy, which have made \nthe gap between the richest one percent and the bottom 99 even more appalling. \nCutting the defense budget doesn\u2019t mean making the country weaker. It\u2019s stuffed \nwith pork \u2014 expensive and unnecessary projects that please only the egos in the \nPentagon and politicians pushing for new spending in their districts. Personally\n I\u2019d rather go with Sanders or Warren and put the money in schools. Bret: The \none bright spot of the Trump years is an economy that has defied doomsayers and \nsurpassed expectations with historically low unemployment and excellent stock-\nmarket returns. Those aren\u2019t small things, most of all to people who live at the\n margins or outside of the labor market, including people nearing retirement and\n looking expectantly at their portfolios. Gail: Some of us believe he\u2019s just \ncoasting off the Obama recovery. And people who worry about deficits must notice\n that ours is exploding from the lost revenue caused by his tax cuts. But go on.\n Bret: If Trump just wired his mouth shut and bandaged his fingers for the next \n10 months to keep him from saying or tweeting something awful, he could just \nride the economic numbers to victory. But, of course, he won\u2019t. He\u2019ll be \nhimself. Gail: Kinda digging the image of that wired mouth. \u2026 Bret: For the \nlongest time I thought that the best way of beating him would be a candidate who\n projected sanity and balance: a \u201creturn to normalcy,\u201d to cite a president of 99\n years ago. Now, however, I\u2019m starting to think that Sanders may be the only \nDemocrat in the field who can beat Trump. He\u2019s the only one who has a clear \nideological vision, who presents the sharpest possible contrast to Trump and who\n has the same sort of cultlike following that can turn a political campaign into\n a mass movement. What do you think? Gail: If Joe Biden holds up, I think he can\n do fine. Presumably paired with someone young and healthy like Amy Klobuchar or\n Cory Booker. Bret: \u201cYoung and healthy\u201d will definitely be a vital consideration\n in Biden\u2019s choice of a running mate. Gail: And at some point today we\u2019ve got to\n argue about Elizabeth Warren. Bret: It\u2019s what we live for. Sorry, go on. Gail: \nBut first \u2026 I\u2019m confused. We\u2019ve been talking forever about how Trump is worse \nthan anything. And now you say Sanders is the only one who can beat Trump. But \nyou wouldn\u2019t vote for Sanders? So basically you\u2019re throwing your chips into four\n more years.  Bret: Not at all. I\u2019m more than happy to vote for many Democrats \nwith whom I have all kinds of political and ideological differences because I \nwant to see Trump gone. I probably won\u2019t be wild about President Buttigieg\u2019s \nchoices for Supreme Court nominees, and certainly not his court-packing scheme. \nI probably won\u2019t agree with much of President Biden\u2019s foreign policy. I\u2019ll \nprobably have many differences with President Klobuchar on economic and social \npolicy. But, whatever: I can live with all of it because nothing any of those \ncould do would damage the fabric of American life the way Trump\u2019s presidency \ndoes. But that doesn\u2019t apply to every prospective Democratic nominee. And \nSanders is just a bridge too far. Gail: Even though you think he\u2019s the only one \nwho can beat Trump? Bret: Fair point. Let me walk that back a step. What I \nreally mean to say is that Sanders has the strongest chance of beating Trump, \nmuch in the way that Trump may well have had the strongest chance of beating \nHillary Clinton four years ago. But no, I\u2019d be wrong to say he\u2019s the only one \nwho can win. Of the other candidates, Klobuchar would be Trump\u2019s strongest \nopponent. She has a winning combination of an aw-shucks sensibility and a first-\nclass brain. And Trump would have a hard time attacking her, at least not in \nways that wouldn\u2019t expose him to a devastating retort. Gail: Suspect a whole lot\n of Democrats could concoct that devastating retort. Bret: That said, she hasn\u2019t\n built a movement and Sanders has. So I\u2019m just hoping that Democratic primary \nvoters want not only a candidate who can win, but a president who can govern. \nGail: Take me back a step. Weren\u2019t you sorta into Biden as one of the moderate \npossibilities? Bret: That was during my speed-dating-with-moderates phase, Gail.\n I kinda rotated through him along with Buttigieg and Hickenlooper and Bullock \nand Bennet and now Klobuchar. I reserve the right to flip back to Joe if he \nstarts winning. Gail: I don\u2019t think Biden has better ideas than Sanders does \u2014 \nwe really need something more riveting than \u201cWhy can\u2019t we all get along?\u201d But he\n feels like the Democrat with the best chance of winning. Nobody hates him, and \nI think most Americans are very eager to move past the issues about his son. \nBiden would be very strong at drawing black voters, but I have to admit, Sanders\n might be more powerful when it comes to getting a great turnout of young \npeople. Bret: An interesting fact about this primary season: There doesn\u2019t seem \nto be much of a correlation between a candidate\u2019s identity and his support. \nButtigieg is young, but younger voters seem turned off by him. Neither Kamala \nHarris nor Cory Booker was able to elicit African-American support the way Biden\n has. Sanders would be the oldest man ever elected president, but he draws much \nof his support from millennials. And, from what I\u2019ve seen of the polls, Warren \nseems to have all but lost a small edge with women voters. I guess this only \nmeans that people vote according to interest and inspiration at least as much as\n they vote according to identity. What do you think? Gail: Did you see the CNN \nstory about Sanders telling Warren over dinner that a woman couldn\u2019t win? He \nvehemently denies it and, of course, I absolutely do not agree. But it is \ninteresting that we haven\u2019t had all that much talk about gender \u2014 even about \nwomen voters. You know, for years I believed women would not vote for a \ncandidate who yelled because he reminded them of their worst boyfriends. I\u2019m \nkinda wondering as the campaign chugs along whether some women are going to pay \nserious attention to Sanders for the first time and think, \u201cCalm down, please.\u201d\n  Obviously my theory doesn\u2019t always work \u2014 look who\u2019s in the White House. \nStill, if I\u2019m right this time it might suggest a plus in the primaries for \npeople like Biden and Klobuchar. And Mayor Pete. Are you still a Mayor Pete fan?\n Bret: Absolutely. His left toenail knows more about the world than both \nhemispheres of Trump\u2019s brain. But if I had to choose between the former mayor of\n South Bend and Klobuchar, I\u2019d choose her. Experience counts for a lot in life \u2014\n and in politics. She has it far more than he does. Sanders doesn\u2019t strike me as\n a screamer. He\u2019s just \u2026 intense. A lot like my own late great-uncle, who was \nalso a socialist from Brooklyn named Bernie. Lovely, loving man, full of heart \nand good intentions. Wouldn\u2019t vote for him, either. The Times is committed to \npublishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Will Iowa Decide the Democratic Nomination? The \ncaucuses were supposed to be less important this time. But they still might pick\n the winner. By Ross Douthat Opinion Columnist With Cory Booker\u2019s exit, the \nDemocratic field has lost another minority candidate, and revived the arguments \n\u2014 pressed by Juli\u00e1n Castro before his own exit from the race \u2014 that the \nwhiteness of the Iowa electorate explains the increasing whiteness of the \nDemocratic field. The debate over Iowa\u2019s influence is interesting because, as \nBill Scher pointed out recently for Politico, the Democratic Party did several \nthings to make the caucuses less important in 2020: tightening the early primary\n calendar, creating a de facto national primary on Super Tuesday, relying on \npolls from Nevada and South Carolina as much as from New Hampshire and Iowa in \nestablishing who qualifies for the primary debates. Scher argues that these \nchoices worked, based on how much less time candidates are spending in Iowa \nrelative to the past, plus the fact that big spenders like Tom Steyer and \nMichael Bloomberg have pushed their chips onto later states. And he dismisses \nthe Castro argument entirely, pointing out that Booker and Castro and Kamala \nHarris all struggled with minority voters as much as with white Democrats, and \nin diverse states like South Carolina and Nevada and California as much as in \nIowa or New Hampshire. Even if you flipped the order of early states so that \nmore racially diverse electorates voted first, the biggest winners would \nprobably be the old-white-guy front-runners, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Yet \neven if we absolve Iowans of responsibility for how the field has culled itself \nthus far, for the remaining contenders Scher\u2019s headline take \u2014 that \u201cIowa \nMatters Less Than Ever in 2020\u201d \u2014 might turn out to be completely wrong. Indeed,\n with three weeks to go before the caucus, it\u2019s quite easy to see several \nscenarios in which Iowa could turn out to be crucial or decisive. First, it\u2019s \nquite possible that Biden could win Iowa outright, and in doing so basically \nwrap up the nomination early. Biden\u2019s early Iowa swoon has been reversed, he\u2019s \nleading the Real Clear Politics polling average and is even with Sanders in \nFiveThirtyEight\u2019s average, and Elizabeth Warren and Sanders seem headed to war \nwith each other as the race enters the final stretch. Which could set up a de \nfacto replay of 2004, when Dick Gephardt and Howard Dean dragged each other down\n and John Kerry won an Iowa victory that set him up for an easy glide to the \nnomination. Would Biden cruise as easily as Kerry? Maybe not: Sanders has the \nmoney and passion for the long delegate-accumulating march, Bloomberg and his \nbillions are waiting, and maybe an Iowa victory would prompt an anti-Biden \nconsolidation (says the pundit who spent 2016 waiting for an anti-Trump \nconsolidation that never came). But given Biden\u2019s strength with nonwhite voters,\n his stable national lead and his perceived electability, if neither of the \nleft-wing candidates can beat him in Iowa, can they really expect to beat him on\n Super Tuesday? Similarly, if a smooth Indianan in Pete Buttigieg and a cheerful\n Minnesotan in Amy Klobuchar can\u2019t peel moderates away from Biden in Iowa, can a\n grouchy New York zillionaire really expect to pull it off weeks later? The \nlikely answer to these questions means that if Iowa votes for the former vice \npresident, it may have picked the nominee. In the second scenario, Sanders could\n win Iowa, Biden could finish a close second, and the campaign thereafter could \nquickly become a two-man race \u2014 with Klobuchar finished, Warren and Buttigieg \nfading, and no room for Bloomberg in a polarized left-versus-establishment \ncontest. The parallel here would be to the Republican race in 2016, when Ted \nCruz\u2019s Iowa victory made him the anti-Trump standard-bearer, and despite a few \nMarco Rubio Moments thereafter it was basically Donald Trump against Cruz the \nrest of the way. In this scenario, Iowa wouldn\u2019t have picked the winner \noutright, but it would have picked the final two and disposed of every other \ncandidate in a single evening. [Listen to \u201cThe Argument\u201d podcast every Thursday \nmorning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] In the third\n scenario, Warren could rally to win Iowa \u2014 an outcome less decisive for the \nfield\u2019s consolidation because of Sanders\u2019s money and grass-roots strength, but \none that would dispose of Buttigieg and Klobuchar and make it likelier that \nWarren surges past her democratic socialist rival in New Hampshire as well. If \nSanders dropped out after that, the rest of the campaign would be a Warren-Biden\n tilt, in which case Warren would owe everything to Iowa; if Sanders stayed in \nit could be an easy coast for Biden, who would have Iowans to thank for letting \nhim run against a persistently divided left. Is it possible to imagine an \nunimportant or at least undecisive Iowa outcome? Sure. A Buttigieg victory in \nwhich the other candidates clump together in a tie for second would essentially \nleave the current top four intact headed into New Hampshire, which would then \nhave its own chance to play the winnower. (The same might be true of a de facto \nfour-way tie, in which Warren, Buttigieg, Bernie and Biden ended up all within a\n point of one another.) And a surprise Klobuchar surge to victory might end \nButtigieg\u2019s chances, while swapping her moderate-Midwestern campaign for his in \nthe top four. In those scenarios Iowa would be extremely important \u2014 indeed, \ncampaign-saving \u2014 to the winning candidate, but it wouldn\u2019t narrow the field, \nlet alone crown a winner. These undecisive possibilities could certainly come to\n pass. But all the scenarios where Iowa doesn\u2019t matter much \u2014 including the more\n outlandish Bloomberg ones and even the Andrew Yang black swan \u2014 depend on a \nsomewhat random-seeming caucus outcome and a national race that\u2019s unstable and \nvulnerable to early-state shocks and Super Tuesday volatility. And the evidence \nlately indicates that the national race is remarkably stable, that Iowa might be\n the best and only chance for long shots to shake things up, and that both Biden\n and Bernie are well positioned to use the caucus to validate their front-\nrunnership instead. In that case many of the candidates who planned for a long \ncampaign instead of camping out in Iowa would have cause to regret their \nstrategic choices. And despite all the party\u2019s attempts to create a 50-state \ncalendar and reduce the caucus state\u2019s clout, the Democrats could still \ndiscover, well before Super Tuesday, that Iowa has picked their finalists or \nwinner after all.

By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist Over the weekend, a \nminor conflict broke out between the presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders \nand Elizabeth Warren, longtime friends who have, until now, seemed to operate \nunder an unspoken nonaggression pact. It started when Politico reported on a \nscript that Sanders volunteers had been given to persuade voters leaning toward \nother candidates. Warren backers, the script said, are \u201chighly educated, more \naffluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what\u201d and\n that she\u2019s \u201cbringing no new bases into the Democratic Party.\u201d  Attacking \nanother candidate\u2019s supporters rather than her record is kind of obnoxious, but \nas far as political combat goes, it was pretty mild. The reason it caused a \nsmall uproar is that in much of the Democratic Party, there\u2019s tremendous \nresentment of Sanders left over from 2016. Many believe he weakened Hillary \nClinton by dragging out the primary \u2014 at one point even threatening a contested \nconvention \u2014 and then only halfheartedly rallying his fans behind her when it \nwas over. Warren alluded to this anger in a fund-raising email keyed to the \nPolitico article that said, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to repeat the factionalism of the \n2016 primary.\u201d She\u2019s right, and she may be the only person who can save us from \nit. I\u2019ve hesitated to write too much about the Democratic primary because I have\n a conflict of interest \u2014 my husband is consulting for Warren\u2019s campaign. \nBesides, while it seems obvious to me that of all the candidates Warren would be\n the best president, I go back and forth over who would be the strongest nominee\n against Donald Trump. On Monday, CNN reported that, during a private \nconversation at Warren\u2019s apartment in 2018, Sanders told Warren that he didn\u2019t \nthink a woman could win the presidency in 2020. (Sanders disputed this, saying \nthat he argued only that Trump \u201cis a sexist, a racist and a liar who would \nweaponize whatever he could.\u201d) It\u2019s infuriating, but I\u2019ve spoken to more than a \nfew women who share such doubts.  In my darkest moments, so do I. Trying to game\n out electability is often fruitless \u2014 on paper John McCain seemed more \nelectable than Barack Obama, and Clinton seemed more electable than Trump \u2014 but \ngiven the existential urgency of defeating the president, it\u2019s still an ever-\npresent concern. So I\u2019m not going to argue that Warren has the best chance of \nwinning in 2020; I have no idea who does. What I will argue is that she has the \nbest chance of bringing the Democratic Party together. Warren\u2019s increasingly \nexplicit argument that she is the unity candidate is correct.  She excites the \nmiddle-aged women who dominate the Resistance as well as the young people \nDemocrats need to turn out en masse. She shares Sanders\u2019s economic populism, but\n as a registered Democrat who has worked within the party \u2014 including in the \nObama administration \u2014 she\u2019s cultivated more good will inside it. (See how quick\n Juli\u00e1n Castro was to team up with her after ending his own candidacy.)  Both \nstate and national polls often show her with the highest favorability rating \namong Democrats of any of the candidates. When a recent Economist/YouGov survey \nasked Democratic primary voters about candidates whose nominations would \ndisappoint them, Warren was last, with 11 percent. Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders\u2019s \npress secretary, dismissed arguments for Warren\u2019s broad acceptability, writing \non Twitter, \u201cWarren has plenty to recommend her, but nominating the candidate \nwho people don\u2019t feel so strongly about one way or the other is not how you beat\n a man as galvanizing as Trump.\u201d But the claim that people don\u2019t feel strongly \nabout Warren is just wrong.  She\u2019s drawn huge crowds throughout the race, and \npeople wait in line for hours to have their picture taken with her. Warren has \nalmost a million individual donors, which is a bit less than Sanders\u2019s 1.2 \nmillion, but impressive when you consider that Sanders had a previous \npresidential campaign in which to build up his donor list. I\u2019ve heard from many \npeople that they\u2019ve never felt as passionate about a candidate as they do about \nher. Sanders may have even more intense devotees \u2014 it\u2019s one of his great \nstrengths as a candidate. But there are also a lot of Democrats who detest him. \nJoe Biden, too, faces significant internal opposition \u2014 in the YouGov poll, 21 \npercent of Democratic primary voters said they\u2019d be disappointed if he were the \nnominee, including 40 percent of those ages 18 to 29.  With Biden and Sanders \natop many polls, I fear that if the race comes down to the two of them, it will \nbecome vicious and destructive, because each has so many supporters who view the\n other as unacceptable. We could even, God forbid, face the sort of contested \nconvention we avoided in 2016. Obviously, the nomination is going to be bitterly\n fought no matter who comes out on top in the February contests in Iowa and New \nHampshire. But backers of opposing candidates would be quicker to reconcile \nthemselves to Warren than to any of the other front-runners. A Warren candidacy \nwould not force centrist Democrats to make their peace with socialism nor ask \nyoung socialists to jettison their dreams of egalitarian economic \ntransformation.  The better she does next month, the more hope there is that \nDemocrats will be able to fight Trump rather than one another.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Trump Likes Farmers Better Than Some Other Welfare \nRecipients Now why would that be? By Jamelle Bouie Opinion Columnist Donald \nTrump ran for president as a welfare chauvinist. He backed benefits for white \nnatives and social exclusion for Muslim refugees and Hispanic immigrants. He \ntrumpeted Social Security and Medicare \u2014 programs associated with whiteness and \nwhite recipients \u2014 and slammed Obamacare, which disproportionately benefited \nblack and Hispanic Americans. Trump sensed the deep anxiety of some white \nAmericans \u2014 their inextricable fear of racial and economic decline \u2014 and \npromised a government for them and against others. In office, of course, this \ngovernment hasn\u2019t really worked for them. It has worked for the wealthy and \ntheir heirs; for industry and concentrated capital. Trump cut taxes for \ncorporations and slashed regulations on polluters. But his supporters could \nrelish in the anti-immigrant hostility of his administration, as if travel bans \nand detention camps could actually restore the lost wages of racial advantage \nrather than build a worse, more precarious world for everyone. There is, \nhowever, at least one place where Trump\u2019s welfare chauvinism has taken hold \u2014 \nhis multibillion-dollar payments to farmers harmed by the president\u2019s trade war \nwith China. In the context of his larger attack on the social safety net, those \npayments, a direct subsidy to a narrow group of favored Americans, are the \nclosest thing to the kind of help Trump promised during the campaign. In early \n2018, Trump announced tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods. China responded in \nkind with large tariffs on American-grown agricultural products. The brunt of \nthose penalties hit soybean growers in the United States, who sell roughly $14 \nbillion worth of their product to Chinese buyers. As the trade war continued, \nfarmers\u2019 incomes plummeted. In response, the Trump administration announced an \nassistance plan. Using a New Deal-era law allowing limited agricultural support \nfor struggling farmers, the Department of Agriculture would make direct payments\n to growers affected by the trade conflict. So far, the administration has \ndistributed roughly $19 billion out of a total package of $28 billion. \u201cThese \npayments,\u201d notes one analysis, \u201care large enough to constitute the single \nlargest source of subsidies for farmers.\u201d President Trump bragged about these \npayments at a recent rally in Toledo, Ohio, and promised even more for the \nnation\u2019s farmers. \u201cWe\u2019re signing a monster,\u201d he said. \u201cA big, beautiful monster.\n Forty to 50 billion dollars to our farmers.\u201d But \u201cour farmers\u201d isn\u2019t inclusive \nof the whole. The vast majority of payments have gone to white farmers, with \nlarge landowners the greatest beneficiaries. It\u2019s true that most American \nfarmers are white. But disparities exist nonetheless. In Mississippi, for \nexample, 14 percent of farms are run by black operators, but those farmers have \nreceived 1.4 percent of the aid that has been distributed in the state. This is \nwelfare chauvinism, albeit modest in scope. The payments will strengthen Trump\u2019s\n political position \u2014 generous compensation to a vocal constituency will buy \nvotes and keep negative stories about his tariffs out of view \u2014 as well as \nsignal his commitment to one group of Americans over another. Contrast the \npresident\u2019s enthusiasm for his farm payments with his disdain for traditional \nassistance. In December, the Trump administration announced tighter work \nrequirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, \ncommonly known as food stamps. Under the new rules, states will have a harder \ntime waiving work requirements for able-bodied adults in high unemployment \nareas. \u201cWe need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand, but not \nallowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand,\u201d Sonny Perdue, the \nagriculture secretary, said in a news release. \u201cNow, in the midst of the \nstrongest economy in a generation, we need everyone who can work, to work.\u201d The \nchange is projected to end SNAP benefits for nearly 700,000 adults, saving $5 \nbillion over five years \u2014 or less than a third of the $19 billion the government\n has spent so far on farmers affected by the trade war. It\u2019s not too hard to \nimagine a Trump who pursued this strategy much more aggressively, doling out \nchecks and assistance to his core constituencies at every opportunity. One of \nhis early advisers, Steve Bannon, urged as much at the start of Trump's \nadministration, calling for an \u201ceconomic nationalism\u201d to match the president\u2019s \nanti-immigrant rhetoric. It\u2019s an approach that may have left him more popular \nthan he is now, or at least, less unpopular. That gets to one takeaway from the \nTrump years: that there\u2019s a real constituency for the white welfare state he \ngestured at during his campaign. It\u2019s not a majority, but our election rules \n(starting with the Electoral College) and the structure of our government (like \nequal representation of states in the Senate) make it large enough to claim and \nmaintain real political power. And the Trump phenomenon also shows that you \ndon\u2019t have to deliver the benefits to hold those voters in your camp. All you \nhave to do is deliver pain to disfavored groups, to target them and make a show \nof it. Donald Trump has been too erratic and undisciplined to take welfare \nchauvinism as far as it could probably go. But it is almost certainly true that \nsomewhere in American politics, there\u2019s someone who has paid attention to what \nTrump has discovered and is planning accordingly.

I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking. Mm, mm. Can you give \nme a clue? Queen. You were thinking about the queen? Mm. O.K. How do you feel \nabout me \u2014 Mm. \u2014 making a film about you? [LAUGHS] You just kissed my \nmicrophone. [MUSIC PLAYING] Can you help me introduce the characters in the \nfilm? So what\u2019s your name? Jamie. And what\u2019s my name? Clown. I\u2019m not a clown. \nHere\u2019s some family photos. Show me who you can see. Who\u2019s that? Mummy. And who\u2019s\n that there? Who\u2019s that at the end? That\u2019s Daddy. Daddy. Who\u2019s that? Alex. And \nnext to him? D. \u201cNo, no.\u201d [LAUGHTER] Who is it? Jamie. That\u2019s right. Mm, mm. \nWhat are you doing? Well, it\u2019s my place, sitting over here. Yep. Ready? Steady? \nWhat do you imagine he thinks of you? I don\u2019t think he analyzes things at all as\n you tend to. When I\u2019m stressed or maybe not even know when I was stressed, he\u2019s\n come up to me and just touched my arm. And you can almost feel it draining \naway. It feels like a lightning conductor, just a small touch. What do you think\n he\u2019s trying to do? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to do anything. He\u2019s just \nempathetic. So he understands how you see things. I think he understands how you\n feel probably better than you do. What he thinks is a mystery to me. I have no \nidea what\u2019s going on in his head. Maybe nothing is. It could be a total blank. \nMm, mm. Mm. But I\u2019ve no idea. I\u2019ve no idea how \u2014 what goes on in his head. I \nmean, he loves food. Anything to do with cooking and food, he\u2019s there like a \nshot. Because he enjoys his food. But then he hasn\u2019t got that much else in his \nlife really. Music. Music, yes. Oh yes, he likes music. ABBA [MUSIC PLAYING] Mm.\n And of course, the circus. He\u2019s mad about clowns \u2014 The circus. \u2014 and the \ncircus. [HORN PLAYING] Do you know where that came from? No, not at all. I mean,\n he\u2019d obviously like to be a clown. Maybe that\u2019s \u2014 hiding behind the mask. I \ndon\u2019t know. No, no, no. I don\u2019t think he wants to be a clown. I think he likes \nwhat they portray, which is a nice and simple mime of life. But he\u2019s got the \nfamily sense of humor. [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] I just looked at him. I just knew. \nAnd that was good, knowing from the beginning. Because I think it\u2019s harder if \nyou think you\u2019ve got a normal child and then find out later that then there\u2019s \nsomething wrong with them. So you could sort of grieve all at the beginning \nreally. So it was. It was like a bereavement. You\u2019re grieving for the child that\n you hoped you\u2019d have instead of which you\u2019ve got this other child. I remember \nfinding out that he got Down syndrome and just holding him and thinking, oh \ndear, start again. When did your own feelings settle down? No, no. That was just\n an instant. Clearly life would not be the same without Jamie. He\u2019s a blessing. \nYes, I, I \u2014 a bit bemused when people hear they\u2019re having Down\u2019s children and \nonly see the negative side. But there are lots of positive sides. There\u2019s a \nvideo of Jamie and Guy playing recorders. And he\u2019s about 6 maybe, and he\u2019s full \nof energy. And that slowly, slowly diminished. I feel like it correlates with \nmoving out. Yes, it does actually. Because that\u2019s the same time he stopped \ngetting any sort of educational programs, even, like, not being around the rest \nof the family. Yeah, no, you\u2019re right. It did change him. We worry about the \nfuture of how he will cope when we\u2019re dead. So our plan was to find somewhere, \nwhich we have. He\u2019s got to get used to the place. And then we\u2019ll disappear, and \nit won\u2019t be quite so bad. The impact is that carers are paid to do things for \nhim. So he no longer talks or does things for himself because he doesn\u2019t need \nto. Yeah, no, you\u2019re right. But you never know. You can only do what you think \nis best at the time. And really, you can\u2019t regret what you do. What\u2019s your plan \nfor Jamie in the future in terms of living? I found an institution, a charity \nthat provides housing and all sorts of things. So I don\u2019t want to put that guilt\n onto any of my children. But I just hope they would look after him. I know \npeople get busy lives and forget. But I should hate to think of him in his own \nlittle world and then none of his siblings taking an interest. We\u2019re all quite \nspread out now. We are, yeah. But that\u2019s irrelevant. O.K. I feel like I\u2019m being \ntold off. [LAUGHTER] You are, you are. [MUSIC PLAYING] By Alex Widdowson Mr. \nWiddowson is a filmmaker and researcher.

In the Op-Doc above, \u201cMusic \nand Clowns,\u201d I team up with my parents to discuss what it is like caring for \nsomeone with Down syndrome. We piece together fragments of insight to gain a \nsense of his inner life, but our differing perspectives reveal as much about our\n own subjectivity as they do Jamie\u2019s. We rarely see portrayals of the diverse, \nordinary lives of people who have Down syndrome (unless we are connected to \nsomeone who has it). Much of what we hear instead is based on a medical \nnarrative. As prenatal screening tests improve, the birthrate of people with \nDown has fallen. I believe people should be able to base life-changing decisions\n on accurate information. But I also feel that a diagnosis does not reflect my \nbrother\u2019s human worth. This film attempts to complement the medical narrative \nwith firsthand stories of what it is like to have someone with Down syndrome in \nyour family.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Whose Side Is Bill Barr On? The attorney general \nwants Apple to give him the keys to our iPhones. But he should be protecting our\n privacy instead.  By Kara Swisher Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a \ncontributing opinion writer.  You could call it d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but everyone knew it \nwas just a matter of time before it would happen again: another mass shooting, \nunanswered questions and, inevitably, another locked phone that could hold some \nanswers. But how can I say it any more clearly? The safety of our nation does \nnot depend on giving Attorney General William Barr the keys to spy on anyone \nwith a mobile phone. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. Yet in another fatuous speech, \nthe kind of which he seems to specialize in, Mr. Barr attacked Apple on Monday \nfor not helping to unlock two iPhones that he claims the government needs to \nscrutinize, saying the company has given him \u201cno substantive assistance\u201d with an\n important criminal investigation.  Mr. Barr\u2019s focus was a shooting last month \nat a naval air station in Pensacola, Fla., in which a Saudi cadet training with \nAmericans killed three and wounded eight others. (Mr. Barr was also \ncomplimentary of Saudi Arabia in the speech; welcome to the Trump \nadministration.)  Apple rightly pushed back against Mr. Barr\u2019s claims, pointing \nout that the company had, in fact, helped the government by turning over \ninformation on the dead gunman from its servers.  What does Mr. Barr \nspecifically want from Apple? He doesn\u2019t say, of course. There is nothing Apple \ncan actually do to unlock the gunman\u2019s phones that government tech geeks cannot \ndo, short of a systematic change that would weaken the security of all phones. \nThus, his aim is clear: He wants the power to go in and out of any phone, any \ntime.  Believe nothing Mr. Barr says. We should question how long the government\n has taken to make these requests of Apple (I\u2019m told that the company was made \naware of a second phone only last week). And, perhaps most important to keep in \nmind, the government can probably already break into our phones if it wants to. \nIt has before, even if Mr. Barr seemed to indicate on Monday that the government\n could not pull it off without help from Apple.  That was what happened when \nfederal investigators battled with the company over iPhone encryption after the \nmass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people in 2015. In that \ncase, the government was trying to get Apple to \u201cbreak\u201d the protection of the \nsuspect\u2019s phone by demanding it create what Apple called in a court filing a \n\u201cGovtOS\u201d (that is, a government operating system), giving it that metaphorical \nkey to a backdoor to all phones. The F.B.I. director at the time, James Comey, \nand President Barack Obama pressed Apple to help it crack into a device that one\n of the gunmen had owned.  The Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, refused to do \nit, in what was probably the most difficult decision of his career. He stuck to \nthe principle espoused by his predecessor, the Apple founder Steve Jobs, who had\n long maintained that the ultimate act of patriotism is to protect the privacy \nof Apple customers against unnecessary search and seizure.  Over the years, \nApple has increased security for consumers through encryption. In the most \nsimple terms, phones were built to be opened only with a user\u2019s passcode (this \ntech is also what enables fingerprint and face identification), and the company \nhas built in no power to bypass that. The iPhone has been engineered to offer \nmore and more user control.  That\u2019s why Apple would not bend in the San \nBernardino case. In the end, reports say, an Israeli firm unlocked the phone for\n the government, and the collision between Apple and the F.B.I. was averted. In \nthe Pensacola case, Apple has said it has given up all the data it has to the \ngovernment. But law enforcement officials, as all law enforcement officials tend\n to do, are asking for more, claiming this time that they want only to look at \nthe particular phones in the Pensacola case, and are not seeking a back door for\n all phones or a special operating system. The problem? There is no breaking \ninto a single phone without showing the government how to break into all \niPhones.  While public safety is important, we have to ask whether getting into \nthese phones is the only avenue the government has to pursue justice or find the\n truth. We must trust our public officials with confidential and sensitive \ninformation to allow them to do their jobs. But the need to guard users\u2019 data \u2014 \nespecially in an age when hackers and more autocratic governments can use it for\n more nefarious reasons \u2014 still trumps the public-safety concerns Mr. Barr is \nraising.  He said in his news conference, \u201cThis situation perfectly illustrates \nwhy it is critical that the public be able to get access to digital evidence.\u201d \nReally?  Does it also perfectly illustrate that the United States government did\n a bad job vetting the Pensacola gunman, a radicalized Saudi cadet? Does it also\n perfectly illustrate that American officials missed his public postings that \nindicated an interest in jihadism? Does it also perfectly illustrate that the \nSaudi government has backed a lot of the type of extremism that might have led \nto this attack? I don\u2019t know the answers to these questions. I don\u2019t know how to\n deal with phones that have become much more secure. But the issues raised here \nmost definitely require real cooperation between tech companies and the \ngovernment; we may even need legislative solutions. But first we need a whole \nlot of substantive public discussion and debate about the trade-offs we face as \nreal progress in potentially dangerous surveillance is only increasing. Apple \nclearly feels strongly about this matter. The company has benefited from Trump \nadministration policies \u2014 the tax cuts, among others \u2014 and has little apparent \nincentive to pick a fight with the attorney general. Mr. Cook has met with Mr. \nTrump many times and has been cordial, even solicitous. Those days seem to be \nover.  The government appears to be trying to make everyone more vulnerable to \nprivacy violations, which is completely backward. A private company should not \nhave to protect us from the government. The government should be protecting us \u2014\n and the fact that it\u2019s not should be the scariest thing of all. The Times is \ncommitted to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
