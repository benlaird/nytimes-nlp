            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by What\u2019s Better Than Planting a Trillion Trees? \nProtecting the forests while we are at it. By Margaret Renkl Contributing \nOpinion Writer NASHVILLE \u2014 After what seemed like 100 years of impeachments \nhearings, anything uttered on Capitol Hill now sounds to my ear like the voice \nof Charlie Brown\u2019s teacher. Nevertheless, a few words from President Trump\u2019s \nState of the Union address managed to break through the wah-wahs last week: \u201cTo \nprotect the environment, days ago, I announced the United States will join the \nOne Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government \nand the private sector to plant new trees in America and around the world,\u201d he \nsaid. Could it really be true? You will forgive me for thinking there\u2019s no way \nit could be true. The whole point of the World Economic Forum\u2019s One Trillion \nTrees initiative is to reduce carbon in the environment and slow the rate of \nclimate change by growing and preserving a trillion trees, worldwide, by 2050. \nBut instead of addressing climate change, the Trump administration has rolled \nback or weakened 95 environmental protections already on the books. The burning \nof fossil fuels is the leading cause of climate change, but much of this \nadministration\u2019s hostility to environmental protections is a result of its \ncommitment to promoting the fossil fuel industry: allowing drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge and other public lands, approving construction \nof the Dakota Access Pipeline, encouraging more offshore drilling in the \nAtlantic. The Trump administration has even gutted the popular Endangered \nSpecies Act, which was passed with strong bipartisan support at a time in \nhistory when the word \u201cbipartisan\u201d was not an oxymoron. Is it any surprise that \nthe Environmental Protection Agency is now widely known among conservationists \nas the Environmental Destruction Agency? I\u2019m trying to figure out how this \nbusiness with trees might be different. Did the president experience a Scrooge-\nlike conversion at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, with the \nbrilliant Jane Goodall, who supports the One Trillion Trees initiative, playing \nthe role of Marley? If so, it would be a conversion narrative more potent than \nany since St. Paul was struck down by a blinding light on the road to Damascus. \nPaul went from persecuting Christians to becoming the faith\u2019s most famous \nevangelist, responsible for the spread of Christianity around the ancient \nWestern world. Donald Trump\u2019s conversion to environmental sanity could be the \nstart of saving the world itself. Nothing would give me greater joy than a \nconversion story in which the Republican Party recognizes and addresses the \nclimate calamity that is already here, but redemption is hardly at hand. More \nlikely: The president has concluded that planting trees will allow him to \ncontinue his wrecking-ball policies while simultaneously posing as an \nenvironmentalist. Call it an arboreal cap-and-trade arrangement in which there \nare no caps and virtually no trades \u2014 the continued pillaging and polluting of \nthe environment in exchange for planting a trillion trees. For countries whose \nleaders recognize the dystopia we are headed toward if significant emissions-\nreducing measures aren\u2019t taken immediately, the One Trillion Trees initiative is\n a brilliant arrow in the quiver of climate-change policy. Leaves absorb carbon,\n wood sequesters carbon and roots stabilize soil so that the carbon already \ntrapped there stays there. Moreover, some 80 percent of terrestrial biodiversity\n occurs in forests. Protecting trees is a way of protecting much of what makes \nlife on earth life on earth. And planting trees is a tangible way to address \nclimate change that can be done on both a micro and a macro scale. Got a sunny \nspot in your yard? Plant a tree. Got a country where logging or development or \nagriculture has mowed down whole forests? Plant millions of trees. \nUnfortunately, the math is more complicated than that line in the State of the \nUnion address implies. Planting a seedling is better than doing nothing, it\u2019s \ntrue, but it takes decades for a seedling to replace a tree, and that\u2019s if the \nseedling survives at all: In China\u2019s Great Green Wall reforestation program, up \nto 85 percent of the plantings fail over time, according to Yale Environment \n360. For large-scale reforestation to succeed, the right trees have to be \nplanted in the right places \u2014 a variety of species, not a monoculture, all \nnative to the ecosystem at hand \u2014 and they have to be cared for until the roots \nare well-enough established to survive the temperature extremes, storms, floods \nand droughts that are the hallmark of climate change. It can be done, but it \ncan\u2019t be done without effort. Reforestation is a crucial goal, but even more \ncrucial is the other goal of the One Trillion Trees initiative: preserving the \ntrees we already have. So far we\u2019re doing a terrible job of it. Here in the \nUnited States, we\u2019re losing 36 million trees a year in metropolitan areas alone.\n In Canada, the ancient boreal forest is being mowed down for the sake of toilet\n tissue. In South America, the rainforest is being burned down for the sake of \ncheeseburgers. Here in Nashville, we are losing trees to development at a rate \nthat would take your breath away: 918 acres of canopy from 2008 to 2016, and \ndevelopment has continued unabated since that last census was taken. In my \nneighborhood alone, just during the past two months, builders clearing three \nlots have taken down nearly two dozen mature shade trees and more ornamentals \nthan I could keep track of. A beautiful magnolia, a whole stand of towering \npines where the neighborhood crows roosted at night, several hackberries that \nprovided food for migratory birds and local species alike. It\u2019s possible to save\n big, old trees during construction, but these developers didn\u2019t even try. Last \nsummer, Nashville passed legislation that requires commercial developers to \nplant more trees \u2014 increasing tree density from 14 to 22 per acre \u2014 and offers \nincentives to preserve \u201cheritage\u201d trees. It\u2019s an important first step, but it \ndoesn\u2019t impose any penalties on builders who choose not to preserve those \nheritage trees, and it doesn\u2019t apply to single-family homes and duplexes at all.\n The bulldozers on my street aren\u2019t going anywhere until the next round of \nlegislation is negotiated. I have hope for a next round. \u201cWe\u2019re not set up to be\n a very tree-minded city,\u201d Councilwoman Angie Henderson, the lead sponsor of the\n new bill (and my former student), told The Tennessean last summer. \u201cI am \nlooking at this as a series of tree-related regulations.\u201d The president of the \nUnited States should look at the One Trillion Trees initiative the same way. \nIt\u2019s a start. If it stops there, it will accomplish nothing at all. Margaret \nRenkl is a contributing opinion writer who covers flora, fauna, politics and \nculture in the American South.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by How Trump Got Trickled Down He pretended to be \ndifferent. He was lying. By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist One thing many people\n forget about the 2016 election is that as a candidate, Donald Trump promised to\n be a different kind of Republican. Unlike the mainstream of his party, he \ndeclared, he would raise taxes on the rich and wouldn\u2019t cut programs like Social\n Security, Medicare and Medicaid that ordinary Americans rely on. At the same \ntime, he would invest large sums in rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure. He was \nlying. Trump\u2019s only major legislative achievement, the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs \nAct, was absolutely standard modern Republicanism: huge tax cuts for \ncorporations, plus tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy. The \nonly unconventional aspect of the legislation was the variety of new tax scams \nit made possible, like the benefits for investors in \u201copportunity zones,\u201d which \nwere supposed to help poor communities but have actually enriched billionaire \nreal estate developers. Trump also came very close to passing a health care \n\u201creform\u201d that would have imposed savage cuts on Medicaid, eliminated protections\n for those with pre-existing conditions and taken away health insurance from \nmore than 30 million Americans. And there has, of course, been no infrastructure\n bill; in fact, the Trump administration\u2019s repeated proclamations of \n\u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d have become a running joke. Policy wonks are still poring \nover the latest Trump budget, released on Monday, but there was no hiding the \nsame reverse Robin-Hoodism as in previous budgets: taking from the poor and \nmiddle class while giving to the rich. In other words, Trump in practice, as \nopposed to Trump in pretense, has turned out to be every bit as committed to \ntrickle-down economics as Republicans in Congress have been for decades. People \noften say that Trump has captured the G.O.P., which is true as far as things \nlike rule of law and support for democracy are concerned. But it\u2019s equally true \nthat the G.O.P. has captured Trump when it comes to domestic policy. The only \ndifference between Trumpism and the proposals of Paul Ryan in his heyday is that\n the Trump administration \u2014 having blown up the budget deficit from less than \n$600 billion to more than $1 trillion \u2014 has pretty much given up even claiming \nto care about government debt. Back in the day, Ryan called debt an \u201cexistential\n threat\u201d; a few days ago Vice President Mike Pence told CNBC that rising \ndeficits aren\u2019t a concern as long as they help boost the economy. And as I wrote\n last week, the economic good news of recent years \u2014 not as good as Trump \nclaims, but the economy has indeed been strong \u2014 largely reflects the reality \nthat after hobbling the economy with fiscal austerity under Barack Obama, \nRepublicans have embraced runaway deficit spending under Trump. But while Trump \nis willing to run trillion-dollar deficits to give giant tax breaks to \ncorporations and the wealthy, he\u2019s as determined as the rest of his party to \nmake life harder for the less fortunate. The grand plan to repeal Obamacare fell\n just short, but the administration is supporting a court challenge that could \ndeclare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It is also supporting things \nlike work requirements for food stamps and block grants that would de facto lead\n to major cuts in Medicaid compared with current law. But why has Trump turned \nout to be such a conventional Republican? My sense is that he doesn\u2019t really \ncare about policy, aside from protectionism, which I\u2019ll get to in a minute. And \nhe certainly doesn\u2019t feel any empathy for less fortunate Americans, or actually \nanyone. So he was happy to make what amounts to an implicit deal with the \nRepublican establishment: You get to implement your usual policy agenda, and I \nget a free pass on my corruption and abuse of power. The one place where Trump \nhas deviated from conservative orthodoxy is his trade war. But why is he a self-\nproclaimed Tariff Man? The supposed reason was that he wanted to bring back U.S.\n manufacturing. If that were really his motivation, he failed: Amid a generally \nstrong economy, we\u2019re experiencing a manufacturing recession, and estimates from\n the Federal Reserve suggest that Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have raised business \ncosts, have actually reduced manufacturing employment. My guess, however, is \nthat Trump\u2019s trade policy has been motivated less by any substantive goals than \nby the desire to look like a tough guy. And while establishment Republicans \nheaded off any important changes in NAFTA, which would have been really bad for \nbusiness \u2014 Trump basically took the existing agreement and stuck his name on it \n\u2014 they have been willing to indulge his posturing on other, less critical \nfronts. The question now is whether Trump will pay any price for betraying all \nhis promises. Democrats took the House in 2018 largely because of the popular \nbacklash against his attempt to destroy Obamacare. But there\u2019s a real danger \nthat Democrats will blow the election by making it a referendum on ambitious \nideas like so-called Medicare for all that are unlikely to become reality, \nrather than on Trump\u2019s ongoing efforts to destroy programs Americans love.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by A Plea to Save the Last Nuclear Arms Treaty Two \nformer diplomats, from Russia and America, call for extending the nuclear arms \nlimitation pact called New START, to make the world more secure. By Madeleine \nAlbright and Igor Ivanov Dr. Albright is a former United States secretary of \nstate and Mr. Ivanov is a former Russian foreign minister. The relationship \nbetween Russia and the United States has been mired in crisis for much of the \npast decade. Communication once considered routine has been cut off, deepening \nmistrust and making it more difficult to reduce tensions and avoid \nmiscalculation. The current state of affairs does not serve the strategic \ninterests of either country, and it puts global security at risk because Russia \nand the United States are the only countries that possess enough nuclear weapons\n to destroy each other \u2014 and all of humanity. Rebuilding mutual confidence and \nputting United States-Russian relations on a safer track will be a challenging \nlong-term endeavor, given the political climates in Washington and Moscow. But \nthe two countries have a chance to head off even more instability by extending \nthe 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which expires in one year, on \n\u200eFeb. 5. While 12 months may seem like a lot of time, in diplomatic terms and in\n the present environment, the clock is ticking fast. The United States and \nRussia can avoid a senseless and dangerous return to nuclear brinksmanship if \nthey act soon. There is no reason to wait, and extending the treaty, known as \nNew START, is the place to begin. With the unfortunate dissolution of the \nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty last year, New START is the only \nagreement still in place that limits the size of American and Russian nuclear \nforces. It also provides vital verification and transparency measures, including\n on-site inspections, that have helped foster strategic stability. The treaty \nallows for a five-year extension if the leaders of both countries agree. \nPresident Vladimir Putin and President Trump should seize this opportunity. Our \ncountries survived the nuclear dangers of the Cold War through a combination of \nskilled diplomacy, political leadership and good fortune. The fall of the Berlin\n Wall did not eliminate those dangers, but the years that followed saw continued\n progress on arms control, a sharp drop in nuclear peril and a reduced reliance \non military means for addressing potential conflicts. Today, in contrast, \ngeopolitical tensions are rising and the major powers are placing a renewed \nemphasis on the role of nuclear weapons in their military strategies. Experts \nare suddenly talking less about the means for deterring nuclear conflict than \nabout developing weapons that could be used for offensive purposes. Some have \neven embraced the folly that a nuclear war can be won. Late last year, we met in\n Vienna with other former foreign ministers from more than a dozen countries, as\n part of the Aspen Ministers Forum, to review the global security landscape and \nexamine these trends in depth. We emerged from these consultations deeply \ntroubled by the possible worldwide consequences of an accelerating global arms \nrace, the increased risk of military incidents and the degradation of arms \nreduction and nonproliferation agreements. We believe that the world needs to \nmove in a new, less hazardous direction. As a result of that meeting, we and 24 \nother former foreign ministers are now issuing a statement calling upon leaders \nof all countries to counter the uncertainties posed by nuclear weapons more \nurgently. The means to address these dangers are at our disposal, but they can \nbe carried out only through wise leadership. During the Cold War, the world \nproved that well constructed, balanced and faithfully implemented treaties, \npolitical commitments and norms of behavior can effectively reduce tensions and \nthe likelihood of conflict. This spring, 190 nations will gather in New York on \nthe 50th anniversary of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to review current \nnuclear risks and proliferation challenges. Extending New START would send a \nsignal to the rest of the world as other countries consider their \nresponsibilities to help halt the spread of nuclear weapons. It could also lay \nthe foundation for increased international cooperation in the next decade. The \nrecent escalation of attacks between the United States and Iran demonstrated how\n quickly the lack of guardrails can move us to the brink of war. Amid the \nerosion of multilateral agreements and diplomatic channels, we came close to \ncalamity. The dangers of miscalculation are too grave for leaders to resort to \nambiguous communication, threats and military action. In the years ahead, the \nsecurity landscape will be made only more challenging by emerging technologies \nand their interplay with conventional and nuclear capabilities. So it will be \ncrucial to create a revitalized spirit of diplomacy based on a shared \nunderstanding of the dangers, and ways to mitigate potential sources of harm. As\n former foreign ministers, we pledge to continue speaking out on this issue and \ndo our part in this effort. Right now, the most important thing to do is extend \nNew START. Russia has indicated, at the highest levels, its willingness to do \nso. All that President Trump needs to do is agree. Legislative approval is not \nrequired. Time is critical. Doing nothing while waiting for a \u201cbetter\u201d agreement\n is a recipe for disaster: We could lose New START and fail to replace it. The \ntreaty\u2019s agreed limits on nuclear arsenals are too important to be put at risk \nin a game of nuclear chicken. Moreover, we have an opportunity to improve \nsecurity and rebuild trust between the world\u2019s two great nuclear powers. It must\n not be thrown away.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Why Bernie Sanders Praised Amazon My company deserves\n scrutiny. But we have already done many of the things politicians demand of \nAmerica\u2019s leading businesses. By Jay Carney Mr. Carney is the senior vice \npresident for global corporate affairs at Amazon. \u201cHello, Jay?\u201d The voice on the\n line was instantly recognizable. \u201cIt\u2019s Bernie Sanders.\u201d Given that Senator \nSanders is a frequent critic of Amazon, you might think he was calling to \ncomplain about something my company had done \u2014 or wasn\u2019t doing. But on this day,\n in November 2018, his message was different. \u201cListen,\u201d he told me, \u201cI just want\n to congratulate Amazon for raising your minimum wage to $15 an hour. That\u2019s \ngood for your workers. It\u2019s the right thing to do. Please thank Jeff Bezos for \nme.\u201d To be sure, Senator Sanders\u2019s appreciation for Amazon and our founder, Mr. \nBezos, didn\u2019t last long. He and Senator Elizabeth Warren, both candidates for \nthe Democratic presidential nomination, regularly attack the company on the \ncampaign trail, other candidates sometimes echo them. Still, his call at least \nrecognized a reality often forgotten or ignored in debates about the role a \ncompany like ours can and should play in the economy. This year\u2019s elections will\n center, as they almost always do, on the economy \u2014 specifically, on jobs and \nhow things like health care and training opportunities affect the way American \nworkers feel about their economic circumstances. As the employer that has added \nmore jobs to the American economy over the last decade than any other, we at \nAmazon have a unique perspective. Critics and reporters often categorize Amazon \nas a big tech company, and it is true that digital technology powers much of our\n businesses. But in today\u2019s economy, phrases like \u201cbig tech\u201d and the \u201ctech \nindustry\u201d obscure more than they enlighten. Our core business, consumer retail, \ninvolves hundreds of thousands of employees who store, ship and deliver billions\n of physical goods \u2014 not bits of data \u2014 via airplanes, trucks and vans around \nthe world. We are not a social media company, a news aggregator or a forum for \npolitical advocacy (or disinformation). While we fully agree that a company of \nAmazon\u2019s size should be scrutinized, we also believe people should know that \nAmazon is doing exactly what many lawmakers and critics insist the private \nsector should do. And because Amazon is a large company with hundreds of \nthousands of employees, as well as contractual relationships with hundreds of \nthousands of other businesses of all sizes, what we do can generate positive \nripple effects across the country. When Amazon raised its minimum wage to $15 an\n hour, we made sure that every one of the company\u2019s warehouse workers, known as \nfulfillment center associates, got a pay increase. But the change wasn\u2019t just \ngood for our associates. We have 500,000 employees in 40 states; when a company \nour size increases wages, competitors feel pressure to do the same for their own\n workers, or risk losing them. Indeed, after our wage-increase announcement, we \nreceived a record 848,775 applications for hourly positions. We know $15 is not \na lot. In fact, we believe $15 should be the minimum anyone in the United States\n is paid for an hour of labor, and in most areas of the country our starting \nwage is even higher. But while the debate about Amazon\u2019s impact at times focuses\n on how our hourly jobs compare to jobs of the past, or to an idealized vision \nof the future, the truth is that more than 40 million Americans earn less than \nthe lowest-paid Amazon associate. For many people, a job at one of our \nfulfillment centers is by far the best option available in their region. And we \nare proud of that \u2014 even as we agree that our political and business leaders \nmust work together to create more and better options for all America\u2019s workers. \nOne place to start: Raise the federal minimum wage to $15 from its current rate \nof $7.25 \u2014 something only members of Congress like Senator Sanders can do. If \nCongress were to follow our lead, all it would take to greatly improve the lives\n of America\u2019s lowest-paid workers is the president\u2019s signature. In keeping with \nwhat political leaders say they want to see from companies, Amazon has plowed \n$270 billion into the domestic economy since 2010. In economically struggling \nareas like Fall River, Mass., and the Inland Empire in California, our recent \ninvestments and hiring have helped to drive down the local unemployment rate and\n added hundreds of millions of dollars to local economies. Improving the lives \nof American workers is about more than wages. We compete fiercely with Silicon \nValley companies to hire the best software engineers, computer science Ph.D.s \nand data scientists. That means offering generous health care and other benefits\n on top of highly competitive pay. To cut costs, we could follow the model of \nsome other companies by giving cheaper, basic benefits to our hourly work force.\n Instead, we not only pay our hourly workers significantly better than most of \nour consumer retail competitors, we also provide the same comprehensive health \ninsurance and parental leave benefits to our lowest-paid associates as we do our\n most senior executives. While the United States may never restore the \nmanufacturing sector to its 20th-century heights, we can train Americans for the\n high-paying jobs of tomorrow. With that goal, Amazon offers fulfillment center \nworkers the chance to learn new skills and earn certificates in high-demand \nfields that offer better-paying job opportunities. Our Career Choice program \nprepays up to 95 percent of tuition and fees \u2014 making it almost free for \nemployees to learn new skills. In most cases, associates who finish Career \nChoice become eligible for jobs that double or triple their current pay \u2014 either\n within Amazon or, if they prefer, with another employer. Overall, Amazon is \ninvesting $700 million to provide training to 100,000 of our domestic employees \nby 2025. Once again, the scale of Amazon\u2019s investment in its own work force will\n influence other major companies to follow suit. All big institutions, public \nand private, merit scrutiny. At Amazon, we welcome it \u2014 from lawmakers, \nregulators and customers. And we know that our critics will at times have good \nideas about how we, and other major companies, can do both more and better. But \nwe also hope that, in examining what we already do, those critics at least \nacknowledge this: When it comes to creating jobs, raising wages, providing \nbenefits and training employees for higher-paying jobs, Amazon is doing many \ngood things \u2014 for the economy, and for American workers. Jay Carney, the White \nHouse press secretary from 2011 to 2014, is the senior vice president for global\n corporate affairs at Amazon.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Why Are You Still Packing Lunch for Your Kids? While \nparents have been focusing on creating Instagram-friendly school lunches, the \nquality of cafeteria food has improved significantly. By Jennifer Gaddis Ms. \nGaddis is an expert on school lunch policy. Parents today face a steady stream \nof advice about how best to care for their children. Mothers, in particular, are\n pressured to be the perfect parent: Most of the advice on social media and \nparenting blogs is directed at them. How to feed the kids gets a lot of the \nattention. Sending children off to school carrying a healthy, made-from-scratch \nlunch is one of the ways that (mostly) mothers are encouraged to protect their \nchildren from the harmful effects of the industrialized food system. Middle- and\n upper-middle-class women especially are encouraged to pack lunches made from \npricey local organic and fair-trade ingredients \u2014 these women are assumed to \nhave financial resources and time to make healthy lunches every morning. [The \ntopics parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that\n matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] It rarely \ngets said outright, but the subtext is clear: Don\u2019t let the lunch lady feed your\n child. For many parents, school cafeterias evoke memories of subgrade hamburger\n meat, soggy tater tots and grilled cheese sandwiches that taste like warmed-up \ncardboard. But in recent years, while some parents have been focusing on \ncreating Instagram-friendly packed lunches, the quality of school-cafeteria food\n has improved significantly. The passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in\n 2010 was a major step forward, requiring schools to serve lunches made with \nmore whole grains, a wider variety of fresh fruits and vegetables and less salt \nand trans fat while creating opportunities for schools to serve free meals to \nall students. Yet the progress K-12 schools have made toward serving healthier \nand more appetizing lunches may stall unless more middle- and upper-middle-class\n parents can be persuaded to let their kids buy lunch at school. Without greater\n participation from children paying for lunch, local school districts will lack \nthe funds to maintain the gains in quality. In fact, if we could muster the \npolitical will, increasing the financial and public support for subsidized \nlunches would secure a future for healthy school food that would improve public \nhealth, create better jobs for school cafeteria workers (some 90 percent of whom\n are women) and help the country transition to a more sustainable food system. \nNinety-five percent of public schools participate in the government-subsidized \nNational School Lunch Program, which was created in 1946 to improve children\u2019s \nhealth and support American farmers. On a typical school day, roughly 30 million\n children, mostly from lower-income households, eat lunch through this program, \nwhich sorts students into different payment categories, depending on their \nfamily income. Children from a family of four that earns more than $47,638 per \nyear pay full price, while lower-income families pay either 40 cents per lunch \nor nothing at all. The average cost for a full-price elementary school lunch is \nabout $2.50, but local districts set their own prices. Some high school lunches,\n with prices as high as $5 per lunch, exceed the limits of affordability for \nmany families. Putting healthier food on school cafeteria menus has done little \nto change school lunch participation rates: By my calculation, roughly 20 \nmillion eligible children, mostly from middle- and upper-middle-class families, \ncontinue to opt out of the national program by bringing lunch or by buying \nspecial \u00e0 la carte food items not covered by the program. As an individual \nfamily decision, packing lunches might seem like the best option, especially for\n children with special dietary needs. But when millions of families do so, their\n actions reduce the political will and financial resources necessary to make \npublic school lunches better for everyone. The Trump administration isn\u2019t much \nhelp. According to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, providing schools with \nthe flexibility to plan menus that appeal to students\u2019 taste preferences is a \nway to attract more paying customers to the federal program and reduce food \nwaste. Mr. Purdue has pursued this strategy for making school lunch \u201cgreat \nagain.\u201d In practice, this has meant enacting policies that loosen restrictions \non the amount of sodium, flavored milk and refined grains that can be served in \nschool meals. The department\u2019s own data shows that participation in the national\n lunch program is higher in cafeterias that serve healthier meals, yet the \nadministration\u2019s latest proposal, released last month, would allow schools to \nserve more French fries and fewer green vegetables. Despite these setbacks, in \nrecent years, community activists have won universal free school meals in many \nof the nation\u2019s poorest schools and in some large districts like Boston and New \nYork City public schools. Many more districts have started robust farm-to-school\n programs that support local food and farm economies. And Democrats are talking \nabout universal free lunch on the campaign trail. There are limits, however, to \nwhat even the most progressive school food service programs can achieve when \nroughly 40 percent of eligible students continue to opt out of the national \nprogram. The food-service director of the Austin Independent School District, \nAnneliese Tanner, told a local news outlet that the district could afford to \nserve grass-fed beef if the kids who currently opt out of the national program \nwould eat school lunch just once a week. All families stand to benefit from \nmaking a public investment in high-quality, universal free school meals. \nMothers, in particular, would benefit far more than we might realize: According \nto the American Time Use Survey, women spend more than twice as much time per \nday preparing family meals as men. Preparing school lunches cuts into their \nalready limited leisure time and adds to the mental load they disproportionately\n shoulder. The solution is right in front of us. When kids eat school lunch, \nthey and their parents are supporting the efforts to improve the national \nprogram for current and future generations.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by A Solution to the D.N.C.\u2019s Iowa Problem Involve all \nregions of the country in a shared first round of voting. By Charles M. Blow \nOpinion Columnist After the debacle last week in Iowa and the reporting of the \nresults there, even more people began to speak openly about how anachronistic \nand antiquated it is for Iowa and its problematic caucuses to continue to have \nsuch an outsize influence on the Democratic nominating process. When CNN\u2019s Jake \nTapper grilled the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, about \nwhether Iowa should remain the first contest, Perez said, \u201cThat\u2019s the \nconversation that will absolutely happen after this election cycle.\u201d It\u2019s about \ntime. And, it needs to be far more than a conversation. Action must be taken. \nFirst, caucuses are undemocratic anyway, because anyone who can\u2019t afford to or \nis unable to spend hours on one specific day in a gym or hall \u2014 the elder, the \ninfirm, the poor, the struggling \u2014 is frozen out of the process. And those who \ncan participate are divested of anonymity, so peer pressure and shaming can play\n an inappropriate role. Second, Iowa is simply not representative of the \nDemocratic Party in a way that should have so much importance. The Democratic \nParty is becoming more urban and coastal. Iowa is a relatively rural Midwestern \nstate. The party is also becoming increasingly diverse. Iowa is over 90 percent \nwhite. In addition, as The Des Moines Register has pointed out, \u201cThe Iowa \ncaucuses have a poor record of picking presidents,\u201d noting that: \u201cSince 1972, \nthe top voter-getter in the Democratic caucuses has gone on to win the \nnomination in seven of 10 contested races, but just Jimmy Carter in 1976 and \nBarack Obama in 2008 won the presidency. Among Republicans since 1980, the \nwinner of the Iowa caucuses has gained the nomination in three of eight \ncontested races, but the presidency just once: George W. Bush in 2000.\u201d That is \nnot the kind of track record that warrants special, outsize treatment. And yet, \nIowa still retains its power as a campaign killer or king maker. As The Register\n put it, \u201cIn only one instance in the history of the modern Iowa caucuses has \nsomeone finished lower than third and gone on to win a party\u2019s nomination.\u201d Pete\n Buttigieg got a huge boost from his strong performance in Iowa, while people \nbegan to consider an obituary for Joe Biden\u2019s campaign thanks to his poor \nshowing. And, on the heels of Iowa comes New Hampshire, another relatively \nrural, overwhelmingly white state. If Buttigieg and Biden repeat their results \nin New Hampshire, there will most likely be a severe adjustment of expectations \nand a realignment of donors. This says nothing of the campaigns that never even \nmade it to Iowa, including the black and Latino ones, in part because they never\n polled particularly well there, no matter how much effort they expended. In the\n closing weeks of Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign, she focused almost entirely on Iowa \nas a make-or-break proposition. But her dreams crashed in Iowa. Whereas she had \nonce polled at 12 percent in the state, that plummeted to 3 percent weeks before\n she was forced to suspend her campaign. This is not the way the modern \nDemocratic Party should choose its nominee. As an alternative, I make this \nproposal: Have the first four contests \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South \nCarolina \u2014 on the same day. In the spirit of Super Tuesday, you could call them \nthe pacesetter primaries. The benefits are multiple. These states represent each\n quadrant of the country: Midwest, Northeast, West and South. They also, \ntogether, would introduce more diversity into the beginning of the process. \nAbout one in five Democratic primary voters in Nevada are Hispanics, and \ntogether with black voters represent a third of all Democratic primary voters in\n the state. A majority of South Carolina primary voters are black. Nevada and \nSouth Carolina also happen to be among the fastest-growing states in the \ncountry. That\u2019s the energy Democrats need to tap into. Lastly, it wouldn\u2019t \nrequire Iowa to fully relinquish its \u201cfirst in the nation\u201d status, but simply to\n share it. Imagine a world in which Harris was able to concentrate her efforts \nin Nevada or South Carolina \u2014 both states in which her polling nearly hit 15 \npercent during the campaign \u2014 rather than Iowa. Imagine a world in which the \nfirst contests were a mix of caucuses and primaries, because different campaigns\n respond better to different formats. Imagine a world in which the Democrats\u2019 \nfirst contests gave them a fuller, more nuanced portrait of whom the full \nDemocratic base supports. As it stands, the process puts too much power into the\n hands of an unrepresentative few voters, a fickle few donors, and a careening \nmedia focus. Win Iowa and you get the headlines, you raise money and you \ninfluence later voters who simply want to be on the winning team.
