            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by What if Trump Gave Alaska to Putin? Republicans seem \nto think no president\u2019s misbehavior could ever be bad enough to warrant removal.\n By Nicholas Kristof Opinion Columnist Let\u2019s not dismiss the Senate impeachment \ntrial as a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d That\u2019s an insult to kangaroos, who lately have been\n suffering enough. President Trump and Senate Republican leaders seem to be \nplanning a rushed, sham trial with no witnesses and limited evidence. This \nreminds me of a trial I once monitored of a Chinese journalist in Beijing: The \nproceedings were held in a majestic court building with high ceilings, plush \ncourtrooms, crisp microphones and attentive security officers, all overseen by \nsolemn judges \u2014 everything a justice system might want, except justice. What\u2019s \nat stake in this trial is the basic idea that America\u2019s leader is accountable \nfor misconduct. Without that concept, we may have a grand Senate chamber and \neloquent speeches, but our democracy rings hollow. Without that principle of \nequality before the law, our grand Senate under Mitch McConnell simply becomes \nan American analogue of China\u2019s rubber-stamp National People\u2019s Congress. \nMcConnell\u2019s grim determination to see no evidence and hear no witnesses is \nparticularly hypocritical because in 1999, during the impeachment trial of \nPresident Bill Clinton, he did favor allowing witnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not \nunusual to have a witness in an impeachment trial,\u201d he said then. Lindsey \nGraham, a member of the House and an impeachment manager at the time, was even \nmore blunt. \u201cIf there\u2019s any doubt, call witnesses,\u201d he urged. \u201cIn every trial \nthat there has ever been in the Senate regarding impeachment, witnesses were \ncalled,\u201d Graham noted then. By the count of House Democrats, the average number \nof witnesses is now 33 for each of the past impeachment trials. Knowing that \nJohn Bolton as national security adviser referred to the Ukraine mess as a \u201cdrug\n deal,\u201d why would senators not want to clarify what he meant? Why risk covering \nup a cover-up? There are less strained arguments that McConnell and others could\n make against removing Trump from office. They could say that the president\u2019s \nconduct, while improper, did not rise to the level requiring removal. Instead, \nTrump and his defenders are pursuing a line of defense that would create an \nimperial, unchecked presidency, because it\u2019s not clear what would ever merit \nimpeachment and removal by their standards. Trump\u2019s team even suggests that \n\u201cabuse of power\u201d itself cannot be grounds for impeachment, calling it the \u201cHouse\n Democrats\u2019 newly invented \u2018abuse of power\u2019 theory.\u201d Newly invented? Abuse of \npower was central to the discussions of impeachment at the Constitutional \nConvention. Alexander Hamilton said that impeachment was the remedy for \u201cthe \nabuse or violation of some public trust.\u201d It was also the basis for articles of \nimpeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee against both Clinton and \nRichard Nixon (the full House rejected that article against Clinton, and Nixon \nresigned before a full House vote). Frank O. Bowman III, a constitutional law \nscholar who is cited in the president\u2019s legal brief, called that same brief \u201ca \nwell-crafted piece of sophistry.\u201d Trump and his supporters simply make \nassertions without regard to reality. This is an echo in the impeachment domain \nof the 16,241 false or misleading statements Trump made in his first three years\n in office, by the count of The Washington Post. For example, Trump\u2019s backers \ninsist that impeachment and conviction require a violation of a particular \ncriminal statute, even though most scholars agree that that is not the case. \nIndeed, one early impeachment was of a judge who presided while drunk, which was\n not a violation of criminal law. Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that removal from office\n would amount to \u201cnullifying an election and subverting the will of the American\n people.\u201d Under that reasoning, despite the Constitution, a president could \nnever be removed \u2014 and in that case, a president is untouchable. We all \nrecognize that a president has the right to pardon criminals, but suppose he \npardoned hackers in exchange for \u201cinvestigating\u201d the Bidens? Or what if Trump \nannounced that he would pardon every Republican bank robber? Or suppose Trump \nfawned over Vladimir Putin to the point of returning Alaska to Russia? As it \nhappens, Alaska isn\u2019t my example, but that of Alan Dershowitz, the president\u2019s \nlawyer. \u201cAssume Putin decides to \u2018retake\u2019 Alaska, the way he \u2018retook\u2019 Crimea,\u201d \nDershowitz wrote in a 2018 book. \u201cAssume further that a president allows him to \ndo it, because he believed that Russia has a legitimate claim to \u2018its\u2019 original \nterritory.\u201d Even that would not merit impeachment and removal by Dershowitz\u2019s \nstandards. Note to Alaska senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan: Your \nthoughts, comrades? Do we really think that there should be no checks on a rogue\n president as he handed Alaska over to Putin \u2014 or Florida to Spain, while we\u2019re \nat it \u2014 or even as he pardoned streams of Republican bank robbers? Must we \ntolerate an out-of control ruler who engages, in the words of the Declaration of\n Independence, in \u201ca long train of abuses and usurpations\u201d? That\u2019s the kind of \nsystem that we rebelled against in 1776, no? The Times is committed to \npublishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The American People Are Being Scammed by Mitch \nMcConnell Senators have a duty to conduct a fair and full trial. The Republican \nleader is trying to make sure they can\u2019t. By Noah Bookbinder Mr. Bookbinder is \nthe executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \nThe removal of a sitting president is the last line of defense provided by the \nframers of the Constitution against the abuse of power by the leader of our \ncountry. When senators take an oath to uphold the Constitution, they assume the \ngrave responsibility to conduct a thorough and fair trial on behalf of the \nAmerican people. Dismissing this process set out in the Constitution, President \nTrump has called the impeachment process a \u201cscam.\u201d That\u2019s his opinion, of course\n \u2014 but this week Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is doing everything he \ncan to ensure that the Senate trial actually is a scam. An impeachment trial is \nonly meaningful if the American people can have confidence in the fairness of \nthe process; only then will the trial\u2019s verdict be worthy of respect. Mr. \nMcConnell is advocating trial procedures that would undercut any possibility of \nthat. Americans understand the basic contours of a fair trial: Each side \npresents relevant evidence, in the form of documents and witnesses. But Mr. \nMcConnell and President Trump\u2019s allies in the Senate appear to think that the \npresident should be allowed to play by his own rules. The impeachment procedural\n resolution that the Senate adopted early Wednesday morning appears designed to,\n among other things, prevent either side from introducing testimony and evidence\n about President Trump\u2019s alleged abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. It \ncould have been worse. Under intense pressure, including from members of his own\n party, Mr. McConnell slightly modified some of the most extreme provisions. The\n current version expands the time for the parties to present their cases to \nthree days from two, and it allows the admission of evidence developed in the \nHouse \u2014 although the president may still object to evidence on any basis. Mr. \nMcConnell\u2019s rules will weaken the power of impeachment as a deterrent to \npresidential misbehavior by, among other things, permitting the Senate to reject\n evidence and testimony that the House has already collected and that was not \npreviously under dispute. In the worst case scenario, the rule could have the \neffect of allowing the Senate to dismiss the House\u2019s evidence entirely. And \nthese rules add new, unprecedented roadblocks to the Senate\u2019s receiving witness \ntestimony \u2014 including from witnesses who have already provided sworn statements \nto the House, some at great personal and professional cost. Every impeachment \ntrial in American history has heard from fact witnesses. And at least every \nimpeachment trial in the last hundred years has heard fact testimony from new \nwitnesses \u2014 those who have not previously provided evidence to the House of \nRepresentatives. Breaking from this ironclad precedent to protect President \nTrump, Mr. McConnell\u2019s rules provide no assurance that the Senate will hear from\n witnesses or collect evidence. Finally, Mr. McConnell\u2019s proposal would allow \nsenators to make a motion to dismiss at any time. Under a motion to dismiss, a \ndefendant argues that, even if everything the prosecution alleges were true, the\n defendant still did nothing wrong. If such a motion were to pass before \nevidence is introduced, the Senate would effectively endorse the president\u2019s \nconduct toward Ukraine without doing even the most basic fact-finding to \ndetermine the truth of the matter. What happens next is not just for Mr. \nMcConnell to decide. Each senator can uphold his or her constitutional duty and \nvote in the coming weeks, as they should have voted yesterday, to ensure that \nthey have the information they need to decide whether the president solicited a \nforeign power\u2019s assistance in his re-election and tried to prevent Congress from\n investigating that conduct, and whether that conduct necessitates his removal \nfrom office. The president\u2019s allies in the Senate must ask themselves whether \nthey would brush aside such serious allegations if someone else was occupying \nthe White House. One suspects that they would react very differently if, for \ninstance, President Barack Obama had been accused of asking a foreign government\n to investigate Mitt Romney. The American people want their senators to engage \nin a serious quest for the truth. A recent CNN poll of voters showed that 69 \npercent of Americans want the Senate to hear evidence and witnesses in the \ncoming days. As I watched from the Senate gallery Tuesday, the gravity of the \nmoment was palpable. For many senators, the coming days and weeks will see the \nmost consequential votes of their lives. They are being given a stark choice: do\n what is right for the nation or do what is politically expedient for the most \ncorrupt president in American history. History will be decided on their watch. \nWe know what the founders intended them to do in this situation. But only these \n100 senators can decide whether they can live up to that standard.

I\u2019m worried they \nwon\u2019t. By Ylonda Gault Ms. Gault is an executive at Planned Parenthood and the \nauthor of \u201cChild, Please.\u201d I am medium-brown-skinned \u2014 neither rich dark \nchocolate nor creamy cafe au lait. I am a B cup and have, for a black girl, a \nbarely there butt. I have flat feet and oily skin. And like so many American \nwomen of reproductive age, I\u2019ve had an abortion. I, and I alone, made the \ndecision to terminate a pregnancy more than a decade ago so that I could be the \nbest mother I could be to the two children I already had. The Supreme Court\u2019s \nRoe v. Wade decision, guaranteeing a woman\u2019s freedom to obtain an abortion \nwithout undue government restriction, was issued 47 years ago Wednesday. A 47th \nanniversary may not seem like a huge milestone. But it is critical at this \nmoment in history. It is a call for deliberate action to safeguard the most \nbasic and ordinary right of all: to control your own body. Despite what some \npoliticians would have us believe, most Americans support that right. There is \nno state in the country where the majority favors an outright ban on abortion. \nSeven in 10 Americans, across party lines, say they do not want to see Roe v. \nWade overturned. Nearly a half-century after Roe, we must not allow some warped,\n anti-feminist ideology to take away our freedom. That means we all have to \nspeak up. Shouting is O.K., if that\u2019s your thing. What\u2019s most important is that \nwe stand together and stand up against the beat-down on sexual and reproductive \nhealth in this country. Just last week, the Supreme Court agreed to consider \nwhether employers can limit women\u2019s access to free birth control under the \nAffordable Care Act because of moral or religious objections. Last summer the \nTrump administration forced Planned Parenthood and other providers out of Title \nX, the federal program that ensures people struggling to get by can afford birth\n control, cancer screenings, and testing for H.I.V. and other sexually \ntransmitted infections. In the past year alone, legislators in 47 states filed \nmore than 300 bills to restrict abortion access. This administration, at a \nlightning pace, has appointed more than 180 judges, many with records showing \nthem blatantly hostile to reproductive rights, to lifetime posts on the federal \ncourts. And in the coming months, the Supreme Court will review an abortion case\n from Louisiana that could further erode the protections of Roe \u2014 or worse, \noverturn it. If our constitutional right to safe, legal abortion is not upheld, \nmore than 25 million Americans of reproductive age could lose the freedom to \ndecide when and if to have a child. What I took for granted \u2014 the freedom to \nhave agency over my body and life choices \u2014 is a right my daughters and their \ndaughters may well be denied. Roe has never been perfect. The right to safe, \nlegal abortion didn\u2019t mean equal access to it. In communities where people have \nlow incomes and in many areas where black and brown people live, the cost of \nabortion often makes it out of reach. So this anniversary should be about \nprotecting and expanding the health and freedom of all people \u2014 regardless of \ntheir race, income, gender identity, sexual orientation, abilities or \nimmigration status. In a new short documentary film, \u201cOurs to Tell,\u201d which will \nbe shown at the Sundance Film Festival next week, we see how access to abortion \nshould play out. The movie depicts four people: myself, another black woman, a \nnonbinary trans person and a Latina. It celebrates the full and empowered lives \neach of us is now able to live because we had agency. This is not complicated or\n political. When you have bodily autonomy and the freedom to get the health care\n you want, need and deserve, your whole world changes and you are able to \nthrive. Nearly 15 years after my abortion, I am at peace. I now have three \nchildren, ages 12 to 20. The most important gift I can give them is the best me \nI can be. My daughters and my son know I had an abortion just as they know I \nhave a mole on one side of my face, and dimples. My abortion is a part of me, my\n story. And I have no shame that I made the best decision for myself, my family \nand our future. Whether they yell it from the rooftops or not, many other people\n have experiences like mine. Research shows the most common post-abortion \nfeeling is relief. Ninety-five percent of us do not regret our decision. This \nanniversary of Roe v. Wade isn\u2019t golden or even silver, but it should spur us to\n redouble our efforts to make access to sexual and reproductive health care a \nreality for everyone.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The First Time I Said, \u2018I\u2019m Trans\u2019 Looking back on \ntwo decades in which things got better and much worse. By Jennifer Finney Boylan\n Contributing Opinion Writer Twenty years ago this month I stood on the banks of\n Great Pond, in Rome, Maine, holding my children in my arms. It was New Year\u2019s \nEve. Over the frozen lake, fireworks burst, welcoming the new millennium. \nSomething inside of me struggled to be known. The next morning we climbed \nFrench\u2019s Mountain, in Belgrade. We do that every year, on New Year\u2019s Day. We ate\n clementines. At the summit I looked down over Long Pond. What would happen, I \nwondered, if I finally spoke the words aloud, after all these years? Was this \nthe moment I would lose my children, my job, my marriage? On Jan. 6, 2000, I did\n it. I\u2019m transgender, I said. So much has changed since then. In some ways, this\n country has become safer, as more and more of us step forward to proclaim our \nrealness. In other ways, we\u2019re more threatened than ever. When I came out, no \none had yet been schooled on the finer points of hating me; most bigots in this \ncountry didn\u2019t know a trans woman from the Trans-Siberian Railway. Because my \nexistence was so far off their radar, few people had bothered to come up with \nlaws to make my life worse. No one lost much sleep over trans folks serving \ntheir country. Caitlyn Jenner and Chaz Bono and Janet Mock were not publicly \nout; Laverne Cox was 13 years from her epic role in \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d \nThere had been plenty of public fighters for trans people before me \u2014 including \nthe iconic Sylvia Rivera, as well my friend Kate Bornstein. But still, there \nwere times when trans advocacy was a lonely place to be. It is not lonely now. \nThe country abounds with trans people, and not only people like me. There are \ndrag queens and nonbinary people and genderqueer folks and so many others. It is\n awesome to think of how far we have come. But it\u2019s also scary. Because now that\n we\u2019re on the radar, conservatives (and others) have developed a new language \nwith which to demonize us. In 2000, the terrifying prospect of \u201cgay marriage\u201d \nwas used to fire up the base. Since marriage equality became the law of the \nland, though, it\u2019s become fairly clear that letting people love one another has \nsomehow failed to destroy the Republic. So conservatives, led by President \nTrump, have moved on to people like us, coming up with one falsehood after \nanother to diminish our humanity. A Trump cabinet member warns of \u201cbig hairy \nmen\u201d winding up in the ladies room. This is false. I have been in thousands of \nladies rooms, and no one has ever said as much as \u201cLindsey Graham\u201d to me. Fact: \nmore Republican members of Congress have been arrested because of their conduct \nin restrooms in this country than trans women. They warn that trans women \ncompeting in sports will somehow destroy women\u2019s athletics. This is also false. \nA year of hormone replacement dramatically affects performance; most trans women\n lose the events they compete in. It\u2019s only when they win \u2014 as the cyclist \nRachel McKinnon did at a World Championship in California \u2014 that they\u2019re accused\n of cheating, as Jen Wagner-Assali, the bronze medalist, accused Ms. McKinnon. \nMs. Wagner-Assali somehow failed to mention that she\u2019d beaten Ms. McKinnon in \nseven of their 12 previous races. They warn that trans people serving their \ncountry in the military \u2014 something that President Bone Spurs did not \u2014 are an \ninsurmountable problem. This is also false. The chief of staff of each military \nbranch has testified that trans service people pose no threat to readiness. They\n warn that coverage for trans soldiers\u2019 medical care is too great a financial \nburden. This is likewise hooey. A RAND Corporation analysis found the cost of \nmedical coverage for trans service people to be less than 0.017 percent of \nPentagon health care spending. My theory is that people objecting to the \nsanctity of the powder room, or tearfully defending women\u2019s athletics, or \nterrified by the prospect of us serving our country, are not actually concerned \nwith those issues at all. What they really object to, when you come right down \nto it, is the fact that trans people exist in the first place. Our existence, to\n use a technical term, weirds them out. I guess I can understand that. When I \nwas a child, it weirded me out too. But what they never suggest is what trans \npeople should do instead of being ourselves. We still don\u2019t know what, if \nanything, makes people trans, but it\u2019s clear that conversion therapy does not \nwork. You can be upset that trans people exist, I suppose, but no amount of \nupset about us can erase the absolute fact that we are here, same as you, and \nthat we have been here for centuries. Transgender people were not put here to \nmake Mike Pence \u2014 or Germaine Greer \u2014 unhappy. Transgender people, like \neverything else, were created by God \u2014 or nature, if you prefer, glorious \nevidence of creation\u2019s inventiveness. We were not made to hurt your feelings. We\n were made to see if you meant it when you said, \u201cLove each other as I have \nloved you.\u201d Did you? I did not know what the future would hold, as I stood there\n on the banks of Great Pond twenty New Year\u2019s Eves ago. Maybe it would have \nraised my spirits if I\u2019d known that in the years to come, I would get to see how\n truly loving some people could be. Would it have deterred me, if I had known \nfor certain that the world would also contain truly heartless and terrible \npeople, at least one of whom would eventually become the president? It would \nnot. I would still have gone about the business of becoming myself. Which is \nwhat I did on Jan. 6, 2000. It was the night of the new moon, the first of the \nnew millennium. It was the Feast of Epiphany. That night I looked once more into\n a starry sky and said, Enough. I will set out on this journey, although I do \nnot know the way.

By Jamelle Bouie Opinion Columnist RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Around \n22,000 people came here on Monday to protest potential new restrictions on guns \nunder consideration by the new Democratic majority in the General Assembly. Most\n of the protesters were outside the grounds of the State Capitol, and most \nappeared to be carrying weapons: handguns, shotguns, carbines and semiautomatic \nrifles. There were armed men in camouflage and military-style equipment \nthreatening insurrection if the state\u2019s elected representatives acted contrary \nto their wishes. Walking through the crowds, I saw Gadsden flags emblazoned with\n \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d and \u201cCome and Take It\u201d banners alongside \u201cBlue Lives \nMatter\u201d patches sewn into vests and T-shirts with oft-used quotations like \nThomas Jefferson\u2019s famous claim that \u201cthe tree of liberty must be refreshed from\n time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\u201d The rhetoric may have \nbeen violent, but the overall event was calm \u2014 a \u201cpeaceful protest,\u201d Brian \nMoran, the Virginia secretary of public safety, told The Washington Post. A \nmodel of democratic assembly. But that \u201cpeace\u201d can\u2019t be separated from \nintimidation; progressive groups urged members not to go to the Capitol to avoid\n violent confrontation with extremists. There were no counterprotests or rival \ndemonstrations. The Second Amendment had effectively limited the First. As I \nwatched the rally, it was impossible not to think through counterfactuals. What \nif these were left-wing protesters instead? Twenty-two thousand members of the \nDemocratic Socialists of America, armed and threatening insurrection if the \nCommonwealth of Virginia didn\u2019t establish a system for single-payer health care.\n How would the state authorities react? Would they give them a wide berth or \nwould they assume hostile intent? What if this were 22,000 black nationalists, \nsimilarly armed, similarly enraged at the prospect of gun control? Would the \npolice have had the same light touch, watching and listening but allowing events\n to unfold? Or would they have gone into overdrive with riot gear and armored \nvehicles, aggressive tactics and a presumption of criminality? We know the \nanswer. In Virginia and many of the 30 other states that allow open carry, \nAmericans have a right to mass, armed protest. But that right, and the right to \nbear arms in general, is informed by the settler history of the American nation \nand structured by hierarchies of race and gender, despite our collective \npretense to universalism. Or put another way, every American has a right to gun \nownership, but the paradigmatic gun owner is still a white man. The reasons \nstretch back to our colonial origins. The drive to expropriate Native Americans\u2019\n land \u2014 and later, to control a surging population of enslaved Africans \u2014 \nproduced requirements for gun ownership enforced by governments in nearly every \nEnglish colony along the Atlantic Coast. In 1658, the historian Roxanne Dunbar-\nOrtiz notes in \u201cLoaded: A Disarming History of the Second Amendment,\u201d Virginia \n\u201cordered every settler home to have a functioning firearm, and later even \nprovided government loans for those who could not afford to buy a weapon. \nSimilarly, New England colonial governments made laws such as the 1632 \nrequirement that each person have a functioning firearm plus two pounds of \ngunpowder and 10 pounds of bullets.\u201d Colonists formed militias to seize \nindigenous territory and created patrols to combat resistance from slaves. \nMandatory gun ownership went hand-in-hand with strict gun restrictions, and in \nthe emerging racialized polity of British North America, this meant banning guns\n among enslaved Africans and free blacks as well as strong prohibitions on \nselling guns to indigenous people. What\u2019s more, the historian Kathleen Brown \nobserves in \u201cGood Wives, Nasty Wenches, and Anxious Patriarchs: Gender, Race and\n Power in Colonial Virginia,\u201d mass gun ownership among white men enabled a \u201cmale\n popular culture that appeared to transcend social differences,\u201d one which \n\u201cpermitted white men to participate in a solidarity of race that minimized their\n class differences but also in a fraternity of men, united and empowered by the \ngun culture they shared.\u201d The \u201cinherent honor of white manhood,\u201d she writes, \n\u201cbecame increasingly based on the right to carry a gun.\u201d These dynamics carried \nover into the creation of the United States. At its founding, the United States \nwas a white republic whose Constitution reflected settler preoccupation with \nracial control. As it grew and expanded, so would Americans\u2019 racialized \nunderstanding of rights, responsibilities, personhood and citizenship. Gun \nownership in particular was for white men. It took disunion and the threat of \npolitical dissolution to break that taboo, although, in the aftermath of the \nCivil War, many white Americans retained their hostility to arms-bearing blacks.\n Postwar \u201cblack codes\u201d in former Confederate states like Alabama prohibited \u201cany\n freedman, mulatto or free person of color to own firearms, or carry about this \nperson a pistol or other deadly weapon.\u201d None of this actually stopped blacks, \nespecially former Union soldiers, from owning guns, and subsequent decades would\n see black Americans develop a tradition of arms carried for defense against \nwhite supremacists, either lawless terrorists or state-sponsored vigilantes. But\n the right to bear arms would remain structured by race, by the idea that gun \nownership \u2014 and the full citizenship it implied \u2014 was reserved for white men. \nThis held in the face of war. Hundreds of thousands of black Americans \nregistered for military service in the First World War, but most were confined \nto labor and support roles, with few seeing combat. It was reinforced in pop \nculture \u2014 from the \u201cheroic\u201d night riders of \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d to the \nidealized white manhood of western gunslingers like John Wayne and Clint \nEastwood \u2014 as well as in politics. Led by Gov. Ronald Reagan, California banned \nopen carry in response to armed patrols by members of the Black Panther Party. \nRead in light of this history, the demonstrations in Richmond were a touch \nironic. Twenty-two thousand people \u2014 most of them armed, most of them white, \nmost of them men, some threatening insurrection \u2014 afraid of losing an expansive \nright to own and possess guns, seemingly unaware of how they\u2019re the only ones \nwho could protest in this manner. It\u2019s because they are paradigmatic \u2014 because \nthey represent the idealized gun owner \u2014 that the state can tolerate their \npresence. The Richmond rally may not mean much for the future of gun control in \nVirginia, but it definitely illustrates the ways race continues to shape the \nright to bear arms, the same way it shapes almost every other aspect of American\n citizenship.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Apps on My Phone Are Stalking Me I discovered \nthat we\u2019re building a digital surveillance state much like the one in China. By \nFarhad Manjoo Opinion Columnist There is much about the future that keeps me up \nat night \u2014 A.I. weaponry, undetectable viral deepfakes, indefatigable and \ninfinitely wise robotic op-ed columnists \u2014 but in the last few years, one \ntechnological threat has blipped my fear radar much faster than others. That \nfear? Ubiquitous surveillance. I am no longer sure that human civilization can \nundo or evade living under constant, extravagantly detailed physical and even \npsychic surveillance; as a species, we are not doing nearly enough to avoid \nalways being watched or otherwise digitally recorded. Your location, your \npurchases, video and audio from within your home and office, your online \nsearches and every digital wandering, biometric tracking of your face and other \nbody parts, your heart rate and other vital signs, your every communication, \nrecording, and perhaps your deepest thoughts or idlest dreams \u2014 in the future, \nif not already, much of this data and more will be collected and analyzed by \nsome combination of governments and corporations, among them a handful of \nmegacompanies whose powers nearly match those of governments. Why am I so \npessimistic? Over the last year, as part of Times Opinion\u2019s Privacy Project, \nI\u2019ve participated in experiments in which my devices were closely monitored in \norder to determine the kind of data that was being collected about me. The \nexperiments have given me new insight into the psychology underpinning \nsurveillance; I\u2019ve realized how blind we are to the kinds of insights tech \ncompanies are gaining about us through our gadgets. Our blindness not only keeps\n us glued to privacy-invading tech \u2014 it also means that we\u2019ve failed to create a\n political culture that is in any way up to the task of limiting surveillance. \nThat\u2019s why, across the species, whether under American or European democracy or \nChinese authoritarianism, few of our cultural or political institutions are even\n much trying to tamp down the surveillance state. In China, the government is \nbuilding a frightening surveillance dragnet in broad daylight, stitching \ntogether facial recognition, fingerprint and other databases into an all-seeing \neye aiming to closely watch more than a billion citizens. Yet the United States \nand other supposedly liberty-loving Western democracies have not ruled out such \na future. Just consider the odd politics surrounding privacy invasion. Donald \nTrump and his supporters repeatedly argue that the F.B.I. is corrupt and \nuntrustworthy. Yet, like Barack Obama before him, Trump and the Justice \nDepartment are pushing Apple to create a backdoor into the data on encrypted \niPhones \u2014 they want the untrustworthy F.B.I. and any local cop to be able to see\n everything inside anyone\u2019s phone. Apple, mercifully, is resisting, just as it \ndid the request of Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department to create a loophole in \niPhone security \u2014 but the fact that both Obama and Trump agreed on the need for \nbreaking iPhone encryption suggests how thoroughly political leaders across a \nwide spectrum have neglected privacy as a fundamental value worthy of \nprotection. Indeed, because of a dearth of laws protecting our privacy \u2014 and \nalmost no high-profile political discussion about the stakes at hand \u2014 Americans\n are sleepwalking into a future nearly as frightening as the one the Chinese are\n constructing. I choose the word \u201csleepwalking\u201d deliberately, because when it \ncomes to digital privacy, a lot of us prefer the comfortable bliss of ignorance.\n As a result, much of the surveillance engine operates underground \u2014 just beyond\n where many of us dare to look. In recent months my colleagues at The Times and \nother media outlets have published a series of shattering investigations into \nmodern digital surveillance. Among other revelations: Advertising companies and \ndata brokers are keeping insanely close tabs on smartphones\u2019 location data, \ntracking users so precisely that their databases could arguably compromise \nnational security or political liberty. There are few meaningful checks on \nscanning for people using facial recognition, genetic profiles or other \nbiometric data. Tracking technologies have become cheap and widely available \u2014 \nfor less than $100, my colleagues were able to identify people walking by \nsurveillance cameras in Bryant Park in Manhattan. This past weekend, The Times\u2019s\n Kashmir Hill reported on a company called Clearview AI that has created a tool \nthat \u201ccould end your ability to walk down the street anonymously.\u201d By scraping \npictures from Facebook, YouTube and other websites to create a huge database of \nfaces, the company lets cops identify people just by snapping a photo. It\u2019s \nShazam for faces, not very different from the kind of facial recognition tools \nwe worry the authorities may be using in China \u2014 and even though hundreds of \npolice departments may have access to it, almost no one outside the company \nunderstands how it works. The Clearview AI story suggests another reason to \nworry that our march into surveillance has become inexorable: Each new privacy-\ninvading technology builds on a previous one, allowing for scary outcomes from \nnew integrations and collections of data that few users might have anticipated. \nI was recently confronted by this sort of cascade with my own smartphone \ntracking data. Late last year, with the help of Stuart Thompson, an Opinion \neditor, I set up my phone to monitor how certain apps were tracking me. I \nfocused on apps that required me to grant them access to my physical location \u2014 \namong them apps to find cheap gas, coupons and nearby retail discounts, and to \notherwise help me navigate and find deals as I wandered about the world. The \nupshot: As the location-tracking apps followed me, I was able to capture the \npings they sent to online servers \u2014 essentially recording their spying. I sent \nthe data to Stuart and his team, who interpreted and mapped the pings the apps \nhad collected about me. Their picture shocked me; the apps had followed me far \nmore closely, capturing much more data and far more often, than I had imagined \nwhen I\u2019d said yes to their tracking. Look at this map, which follows the pings \ncollected by the apps on one Sunday afternoon last year: Tracking My Life \nSmartphone snooping software let me record when my phone shared my precise \nlocation with third-party trackers. Each green dot below is one location ping \nsent to those companies. 2 Visited the Community School of Music and Arts 11:43 \na.m. Started driving 4 Visited Whole Foods 1 3 Visited Felipe\u2019s Market  Visited \nRick\u2019s Cafe 2 Visited the Community School of Music and Arts 11:43 a.m. Started \ndriving 4 Visited Whole Foods 1 Visited Felipe\u2019s Market  3 Visited Rick\u2019s Cafe 1\n Visited Felipe\u2019s Market  11:43 a.m. Started driving 4 Visited Whole Foods 2 \nVisited the Community School of Music and Arts 3 Visited Rick\u2019s Cafe N Note: \nDriving path is inferred | By The New York Times On the map, you can see the \napps are essentially stalking me. They see me drive out one morning to the gas \nstation, then to the produce store, then to Safeway; later on I passed by a \nmusic school, stopped at a restaurant, then Whole Foods. But location was only \none part of the data the companies had about me; because geographic data is \noften combined with other personal information \u2014 including a mobile advertising \nID that can help merge what you see and do online with where you go in the real \nworld \u2014 the story these companies can tell about me is actually far more \ndetailed than I can tell about myself. Like a lot of people, I\u2019ve long justified\n my apathy about privacy through innocence: I\u2019m a stand-up guy \u2014 what do I have \nto hide? But looking at the God\u2019s-eye-view that a few coupon apps can glean \nabout me, I can no longer pretend I\u2019ve got nothing to worry about. Sure, I\u2019m not\n a criminal \u2014 but do I want anyone to learn everything about me? And more to the\n point: Is it wise for us to let any entity learn everything about everyone? \nBecause those are the stakes. The remaining uncertainty about the surveillance \nstate is not whether we will submit to it \u2014 only how readily and completely, and\n how thoroughly it will warp our society. Will we allow the government and \ncorporations unrestricted access to every bit of data we ever generate, or will \nwe decide that some kinds of collections, like the encrypted data on your phone,\n should be forever off limits, even when a judge has issued a warrant for it? In\n the future, will there be room for any true secret \u2014 will society allow any \nunrecorded thought or communication to evade detection and commercial analysis? \nAnd, if there can be no more secrets, how will we account for what we lose? How \ncompletely will living under surveillance numb creativity and silence radical \nthought? Can human agency survive the possibility that some companies will know \nmore about all of us than any of us can ever know about ourselves? I\u2019m worried \nwe\u2019ll soon be forced to find out.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Why Trump Persists Voters are less tolerant, less \nempathetic and less interested in integrity than many political analysts \nthought. By Thomas B. Edsall Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from \nWashington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. The failure of the \nAmerican electorate to rise up in opposition to President Trump \u2014 whose outrages\n are well-documented \u2014 suggests that voters are less tolerant, less empathetic \nand less insistent on integrity than many believe. The election of Trump and his\n first three years in office have revealed a nation deeply ambivalent about \nimmigration, race, equality, fairness \u2014 even about the ground rules of democracy\n itself. What if the belief systems used to justify anti-immigrant policies and \nto justify race prejudice, for that matter \u2014 hostility to outsiders, insularity,\n high sensitivity to external threat \u2014 are as deeply ingrained in the American \nbody politic as belief systems sympathetic to immigration and to racial equality\n \u2014 openness, receptivity to new experiences, trust? Karen Stenner, a political \npsychologist and behavioral economist best known for \u201cpredicting the rise of \nTrump-like figures under the kinds of conditions we now confront,\u201d responded to \nmy emailed inquiries by noting the conflicting pressures at play: I don\u2019t think \nI would agree that Trumpian conservative stands on immigration, race and \nhomelessness are a more \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cdefault\u201d position. Communities with a good\n balance of people who seek out diversity, complexity, novelty, new and exciting\n experiences etc., and those who are disgusted by and averse to such things, \navoid them, and tell others to do likewise, tend to thrive and prosper in human \nevolution. Finding the right balance, Stenner said, \u201cis vital to both societal \ncohesion and human flourishing.\u201d But, she warned, \u201cwe may have tipped the \nbalance too far in favor of unconstrained diversity and complexity,\u201d pushing the\n boundary beyond \u201cmany people\u2019s capacity to tolerate it.\u201d At this juncture, she \nargued, we need to tinker with that balance and get it right for everyone. So \nthere\u2019s the paradox of our times: it is likely that rather less liberal \ndemocracy will ultimately make liberal democracy more secure. Among liberals, \nStenner argued, the greatest ambivalence \u201cattaches to immigration issues,\u201d and \nthat ambivalence is only worsened by the unwillingness of liberals to accept an \nopen debate in which immigration opponents can \u201cexpress their fears and \nconcerns, without being called racists.\u201d Suzette Brooks Masters \u2014 who has \nwritten extensively about immigrant integration, detention, employment-based \nimmigration and the immigrants\u2019 rights field generally \u2014 made a parallel point \nin her recent study of immigration, \u201cChange is Hard\u201d: Academics agree that it is\n the pace of change relative to the composition of the receiving community that \nmatters most. Simply put, if a place is already quite diverse, making it more \ndiverse matters less. Even significant inflows of diverse newcomers will be \nperceived as less threatening because the community has already adapted to \ngreater diversity. By contrast, in a relatively homogeneous location, even small\n absolute numbers of newcomers, such as refugees, can be disruptive and activate\n cultural anxiety. Jonathan Haidt, a professor at NYU\u2019s Stern School of \nBusiness, offered a similarly nuanced examination of how the balance between \ntribalism and openness might play out. Tribalism, he wrote by email, is not a \nmindless and eternal \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality. It is a set of psychological \nadaptations that make people respond to threats and intergroup competition with \nan urge to band together, enforce loyalty to the team, and guard boundaries or \nterritory. In the political arena, Haidt continued, if one gains prestige for \noutdoing others on one\u2019s devotion to sacred values \u2014 such as guarding America\u2019s \nborders, on the right, or being antiracist on the left \u2014 then the party\u2019s \nrhetoric will shift to the extremes, with candidates making more extreme \nproposals that gain them prestige. The pressures to go to extremes, Haidt \nsuggested, are \u201croughly symmetrical between left and right.\u201d John R. Hibbing, a \npolitical scientist at the University of Nebraska, takes a more uncompromising \nstance. In an email, he wrote: Though consideration of such matters is always \nspeculative, suggesting the possibility that conservative orientations, \nparticularly on topics such as immigration and race, are evolutionarily more \nprimal is perfectly reasonable. In their book \u201cPredisposed: Liberals, \nConservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences,\u201d Hibbing, Kevin B. \nSmith, of the University of Nebraska, and John R. Alford, of Rice, argue that \nliberalism is \u201can evolutionary luxury\u201d that can emerge in people when \u201cnegative \nstimuli becoming less prevalent and less deadly,\u201d or, as Hibbing put it in an \nemail, \u201cwhen daily threats to life and limb posed by other human beings have \ndiminished.\u201d Conversely, they write, if the environment shifts back to a \n\u201cthreat-filled atmosphere,\u201d then \u201cpositive selection for conservative \norientations would reappear.\u201d Let\u2019s take a look at one of the core divisions \nbetween liberals and conservatives: the causes of poverty. The right tends to \nblame individual failings while the left tends to place the onus on economic and\n political forces. The accompanying chart, created from 2019 Voter Study Group \ndata by Zach Goldberg, a doctoral candidate in political science at Georgia \nState, shows the difference. Why Are Some Americans Poor?

Skitka, a professor of psychology at the \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago, and four colleagues conducted an intriguing \nset of tests to determine the durability and strength of liberal and \nconservative beliefs on poverty in a 2002 paper, \u201cDispositions, Scripts, or \nMotivated Correction? Understanding Ideological Differences in Explanations for \nSocial Problems.\u201d They found that in troubled times, when competition for \nlimited goods intensifies, liberals move to the right: It is much easier to get \na liberal to behave like a conservative than it is to get a conservative to \nbehave like a liberal. Liberals act like conservatives when resources are \nscarce, cognitive load is high, and aid serves secondary rather than primary \nneeds. Conservatives only act like liberals when they are asked to consider \nhelping a person with internally controllable causes of need who has \nconvincingly reformed. In an email, Skitka provided some reasons for this \ndifference: My research has found that holding people responsible for their \nplight is a more natural response than feeling sympathetic to those in need. \nUnder most conditions, liberals are more sympathetic to the needy in large part \nbecause they are more likely to attribute the causes of their need to something \nabout the situation. Conservatives, in contrast, tend to attribute the causes of\n people\u2019s need to something about the needy person: They don\u2019t work hard enough,\n etc. Because blaming the individual is a default or fallback position, liberals\n have to go through a \u201cmore cognitively effortful\u201d process to reach their less \n\u201cnatural\u201d conclusion \u2014 \u201cpeople have to basically override a more natural \ninclination to make dispositional attributions instead,\u201d according to Skitka. As\n a result, she continued, under certain pressures, liberals respond to the needy\n more like conservatives when resources are scarce or when they are under a lot \nof cognitive load (e.g., they are distracted), or their ability to engage in \nself-control is reduced (e.g., when under the influence of alcohol). The left-\nright differences over the causes of poverty apply to other controversial \nsubjects highly salient in contemporary American politics, Skitka and her \ncolleagues write: Liberals tend to focus on situational or institutional \nexplanations for things like homelessness or why people commit crimes, whereas \nconservatives tend to focus on personal explanations for the same phenomena. \nSkitka and her fellow authors received strong support for their argument in a \n2012 paper, \u201cLow-Effort Thought Promotes Political Conservatism,\u201d by Scott \nEidelman, a professor of psychology at the University of Arkansas, and three co-\nauthors. Eidelman and his colleagues conducted a series of tests comparing the \nanswers of two groups to ideologically revealing questions. The first faced time\n pressure or were forced to answer with distracting background noises, in \nenvironments \u201ctaxing, limiting or otherwise disengaging effortful, deliberative \nthought.\u201d The second group was asked the same questions with plenty of time to \nthink and without noise or other distractions. In each case, those tested under \nfavorable circumstances provided more liberal answers than those tested under \nmore hostile conditions. The adverse conditions forced those participants to \nperform what the authors called \u201clow-effort thinking,\u201d and the results showed \nthat \u201clow-effort thinking promotes political conservatism.\u201d In one of their four\n experiments, the authors went to an unidentified bar in New England and \npersuaded 85 drinkers to take the test and have their alcohol levels measured. \nThe results: Bar patrons reported more conservative attitudes as their level of \nalcohol intoxication increased. Because alcohol limits cognitive capacity and \ndisrupts controlled responding, while leaving automatic thinking largely intact,\n these data are consistent with our claim that low-effort thinking promotes \npolitical conservatism. Diana Mutz, a professor of political science and \ncommunication at the University of Pennsylvania, pointed out that one effect of \nincreasing education levels is to fundamentally change individual world views. \n\u201cThe one sense in which there is evidence that we do \u2018overcome\u2019 our tendencies \ntoward tribalism is through education,\u201d she wrote by email. \u201cEvery study I\u2019ve \never seen across the social sciences shows that education promotes less in-group\n favoritism and greater tolerance toward those unlike ourselves,\u201d she continued.\n \u201cIn panel studies that track the same people over time, as people gain advanced\n levels of education, they become more tolerant and favorable toward liberal \ndemocratic norms.\u201d One scholar who has devoted much of his career to the study \nof the transition in developed countries from materialist to post-materialist \nvalues \u2014 from a value orientation that emphasizes economic and physical security\n to one that emphasizes self-expression and quality of life \u2014 is Ronald \nInglehart, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan. He \nsees a generalized transition to more liberal world views \u2014 perhaps as a \nconcomitant of voters with college and graduate school degrees. \u201cLiberal values \nare not a veneer, masking a much less pleasant reality,\u201d Inglehart pointed out \nin an email. \u201cA sizable and growing segment\u201d of the American public, he wrote, \n\u201chas tolerant liberal views and these views are deep-rooted and enduring.\u201d \nInglehart\u2019s research has found that those who developed postmaterialist values \n(which strongly correlate with what you think of as \u201cliberal\u201d values) in their \npre-adult years, remained relatively postmaterialist 40 years later. \nMaterialists and postmaterialists take opposing sides in response to these \nstatements: A woman has to/doesn\u2019t have to have children to be fulfilled; I \nwould/wouldn\u2019t want foreigners, homosexuals or people with AIDS as neighbors; A \nchild needs/does not need a home with both a father and a mother in order to \ngrow up happily; Imagination is/is not one of the most important things to teach\n a child; Men do/don\u2019t make better political leaders than women; Homosexuality \nis/is never justifiable. From 1970 to the present, the ratio of materialists to \npostmaterialists has gone from 4-1 to 1-1, according to Inglehart. Ryan Enos, a \npolitical scientist at Harvard whose research has demonstrated the \nprecariousness of liberal racial commitments when tested in real world \ncircumstances, replied by email to my inquiries: There is no doubt that there is\n more ambivalence on these issues among liberals and moderates than is reflected\n in the polls. In addition to the pressures of \u201csocial desirability bias\u201d to \ngive the liberal answer, Enos wrote, others will lie to themselves, telling \nthemselves they believe something that they really don\u2019t; and others are liberal\n in theory, but less so in practice when it comes to things like homelessness in\n their own city or neighborhood. There are other sources of internal tension and\n conflicting interests among Democrats and liberals. I have written frequently \non the problems confronting the \u201cupstairs-downstairs\u201d Democratic coalition \u2014 \ncombining well-educated, relatively affluent voters who are disproportionately \nwhite with poor and working class voters who are heavily minority. In his book, \n\u201cPolitics Is for Power: How to Move Beyond Political Hobbyism, Take Action, and \nMake Real Change,\u201d and in an Atlantic article, Eitan Hersh, a political \nscientist at Tufts, has focused on the relatively weaker commitments of the \nupscale constituency of the Democratic coalition to policy initiatives aimed at \nproviding substantive help. Many college-educated people \u201cthink they are deeply \nengaged in politics,\u201d Hersh wrote in the Atlantic: They follow the news \u2014 \nreading articles like this one \u2014 and debate the latest developments on social \nmedia. They might sign an online petition or throw a $5 online donation at a \npresidential candidate. In fact, he argues, their consumption of political \ninformation is a way of satisfying their own emotional and intellectual needs. \nThese people are political hobbyists. What they are doing is no closer to \nengaging in politics than watching SportsCenter is to playing football. Hersh is\n hard on these voters, a group he describes as \u201ccollege-educated white people, a\n demographic group that is now predominately Democratic.\u201d These voters, he \nwrites, do politics as hobbyists because they can. On the political left, they \nmay say they fear President Donald Trump. They may lament polarization. But they\n are pretty comfortable with the status quo. They do not feel a sense of \nobligation, of \u201clinked fate,\u201d to people who have concrete needs such that they \nare willing to be their allies. They might front as allies on social media, but \nvery few white liberals are actively engaging in face-to-face political \norganizations, committing their time to fighting for racial equality or any \nother issue they say they care about. Why does all this matter? What difference \ndoes it make if liberals and Democrats are more ambivalent than conservatives \nand Republicans? For one thing, it means that in elections that are increasingly\n negative, ambivalent partisans \u2014 Democrats in this case \u2014 will be more \nvulnerable to attacks designed to generate conflict, to weaken enthusiasm and to\n increase the likelihood of nonvoting. President Trump and the proponents of the\n Republican Party he dominates are certain to do all they can to capitalize on \nthis vulnerability. Most importantly, Democratic ambivalence, in a year when \nhigh turnout is mandatory, reflects the larger problem facing a political party \nthat is now focused on its shared animosity to Trump. That animosity may or may \nnot be enough to propel its presidential candidate to victory, but the inherent \ntension between different sectors of the center-left coalition over ideological,\n economic and social issues \u2014 not to mention glaring levels of intraparty income\n inequality \u2014 calls into question exactly what common ground holds the \nDemocratic coalition together.
