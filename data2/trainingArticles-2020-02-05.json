            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The conversation Um, What Just Happened in Iowa? \nButtigieg and Sanders were triumphant. But Trump had a few things he wanted to \nsay for himself. By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens \nare opinion columnists. They converse every other week. Bret Stephens: Just when\n I thought the Iowa caucus, and maybe the Democratic nomination, was in the bag \nfor Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg pulled out what looks to be either a largely \nunpredicted first-place finish in the Hawkeye State or at least a close second-\nplace. My faith in pollsters is kaput. But my faith in democracy \u2014 and Democrats\n \u2014 just got a boost. Your thoughts, Gail? Gail Collins: Bret, this is turning \ninto a truly fascinating contest. Bernie Sanders, who is 78, is appealing to the\n youth vote. Pete Buttigieg, 38, has a very strong following among older \nDemocrats. Joe Biden, who was the surefire winner, had an astonishingly poor \nshowing. And Michael Bloomberg is looking like a genius for passing up all the \nbig make-or-break first primaries. But before we move on with the candidates, \ntell me what your feelings were about Iowa. Was the first-state-to-vote a \ndisaster or were we just cranky from being kept up late? Bret: My feeling was, \nwelcome to the Twilight Zone. This has already spawned some kooky conspiracy \ntheories, but it\u2019s also going to raise serious doubts about the integrity of \nelections. Gail: I do like your Twilight Zone nostalgia. Who can ever forget the\n episode where space aliens descended on a small Midwestern state and ate all \nthe ballots? Bret: Of course: Rod Serling\u2019s famous Hanging Chads episode. Go on \n\u2026. Gail: But I have to admit, having gotten past that looong period of who-won \nimpatience, I\u2019m feeling more sympathetic to the Iowa Democratic Party. Their \npriority was not making a mistake. And after all the boredom and the waiting, \nI\u2019m very confident in their ability to deliver an accurate count. Not that I \ndon\u2019t think other states should get a turn to go first. Bret: Beyond that, \nthough, there\u2019s a larger civilizational question: Why are things that used to be\n relatively easy now so darn hard? Counting ballots used to be a fairly \nstraightforward affair. In Iowa, someone had the remarkable idea that an app \ncould make things easier, and instead it did precisely the opposite. We\u2019ll have \nto add this to the list of things we used to be able to do as a country but no \nlonger can: fly to the moon; build highway intersections in under a decade; and \nteach long division in a comprehensible fashion. Gail: As a technological \nilliterate, I have long worked under the code of Beware the App. I identify with\n the people who were running the caucuses on the ground level, just hanging on \nto the paper ballots. Bret: Both of us know that you are much more \ntechnologically literate than I am. But back to Iowa. Does this mean Biden\u2019s \ntoast? Gail: Well, he certainly looks crispy. I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s done \u2014 \nhe\u2019ll be hanging on at least to South Carolina. But so far there is absolutely \nnothing about the campaign that suggests he\u2019s going to go all the way. I\u2019m \nwondering if the big winner is the man who decided to duck all the cute \u201cWe\u2019re \nfirst!\u201d primaries and wait for Super Tuesday. That would be Michael Bloomberg. \nAny thoughts? Bret: The consistent theme of this nomination process has been \ninconsistency: Every candidate who was given up politically for dead, including \nSanders and Buttigieg, has roared back to life. And everyone who was supposed to\n be a heavyweight contender, including Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala \nHarris, has underperformed. So I\u2019d give both Biden and Warren at least one more \nchance before we write them off for the year. As for Bloomberg, I wish him well \nbut I have my doubts. The strategy of waiting out the early states didn\u2019t work \nfor Rudy Giuliani when he ran for the Republican nomination in 2008, skipping \nIowa and New Hampshire and hoping to win big in Florida. Gail: True, but trust \nme \u2014 he was the worst presidential candidate in the history of elections. Bret: \nBloomberg\u2019s strategy is to wait until Super Tuesday, but by then it may be too \nlate to make much of an impression, no matter how much money he spends. \nPolitics, like skiing, has a lot to do with momentum, and the results in Iowa \nand New Hampshire will carry their respective winners a long way. Gail: Yeah, \nbut I\u2019m hoping the Iowa-New-Hampshire dictatorship is fading. Next time in \nNebraska? Meanwhile, this Iowa meltdown really was kind of embarrassing \u2026 Bret: \nWhich is to say, a boon to Donald Trump, who is already gloating. \u201cThe Democrat \nCaucus is an unmitigated disaster,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cNothing works, just like they \nran the Country.\u201d If we were to have something like this on Election Day in \nNovember, he\u2019d be liable to claim victory before the results came in, or declare\n a stolen election in the event the Democratic nominee eventually won. Gail: I \nhave a sinking feeling that whatever happens in November, Trump will be \ndeclaring victory. My list of election nightmares range from Russians hacking \nthe system to a massive computer crash in some swing state, to Donald Trump \nsimply claiming \u201cVote fraud!\u201d and refusing to leave the White House if he loses.\n Bret: Or, alternatively, the Democratic Party nominating a candidate who can\u2019t \nbeat him fair-and-square. He previewed his campaign themes in his State of the \nUnion \u2014 the first time in history a president delivered a speech to Congress \nwhile awaiting the verdict of an impeachment trial in which he will almost \ncertainly be acquitted. My sense is that Trump has emerged from the impeachment \ndrama no worse off, and possibly politically stronger, than he was at the \nbeginning. Do you agree? Gail: Bret, it\u2019s sort of cruel of you to pile that on \ntop of the Dems-can\u2019t-run-an-election theme. But yeah, you\u2019re probably right. \nTrump\u2019s surviving. In the long run, history will judge him as a terrible, \ncrooked president who misused his constitutional powers to try to guarantee \nhimself re-election. And confirm that the House Democrats were right in taking a\n stand against him. In the short term, it looks as if he\u2019s going to avoid any \npunishment for his astonishingly awful misdeeds. Although I nurture hope that \nbefore the election there\u2019ll be some new evildoing uncovered that makes the \nsleaziness and corruption of Trump\u2019s administration clear even to his fans. \nLooking at you, Rudy. Bret: Imagine, Gail, if Trump turned the Oval Office into \na meth lab. First, the president would call it fake news. Next, Mick Mulvaney \nwould admit it is a meth lab, but that was O.K. because he hadn\u2019t yet cooked up \nany meth, that his real intention was to teach chemistry to indigent 9th \ngraders, and that Democrats are \u201canti-science.\u201d Finally, his lawyers would \ninsist that it\u2019s unimpeachable because, if the president does it, it\u2019s legal. \nGail: Bret, you made me smile. Was not planning on smiling for at least two \ndays. Bret: But back to the State of the Union, Gail. Trump emphasized the very \nlow unemployment rate and good stock-market returns. He talked about the new \nU.S.-Canada-Mexico free trade deal and claimed victory in the trade war with \nChina. He made a pitch to African-American voters by pointing to criminal-\njustice reform and strong job figures for black America. He stressed that he \nordered the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Iranian general \nQassim Suleimani. All in all, it was a fairly effective performance. Who among \nthe Democratic contenders is best positioned to rebut it? Gail: We need somebody\n who can speak to the large number of Americans who are still struggling to make\n ends meet in a country where the rich get richer while paying precious little \ntaxes. The vast number of citizens who have nightmares about medical bills. All \nthe people, from farmers to families on food stamps, who are teetering on the \nbrink of disaster because of Trump\u2019s ideology-driven, intellectually \nimpoverished management of government programs. And then chart a clear \nalternative. While reminding the nation that the good parts of the economy are \nmainly the products of the Obama administration. My vote goes to Elizabeth \nWarren. Who, sigh, didn\u2019t do that well in Iowa. But there\u2019s always New \nHampshire. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the \neditor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Why I\u2019m Voting to Acquit President Trump Impeachment \nwill end in the Senate. It\u2019s time to take up consensus issues. By Rob Portman \nMr. Portman is a Republican senator from Ohio. On Wednesday I will join a \nmajority of my Senate colleagues in opposing the impeachment of President Trump \nbrought by the House of Representatives. For four months, since the release of \nthe memorandum of the call between President Trump and President Volodymyr \nZelensky of Ukraine, I have consistently said that Mr. Trump\u2019s request for an \ninvestigation of Joe Biden and any effort to tie the release of military aid to \ninvestigations were improper and shouldn\u2019t have happened. However, I do not \nbelieve these actions rise to the level where it would be necessary to remove a \npresident from office. The founders intended for impeachment to be extremely \nrare, and they required those seeking to remove the president to meet the burden\n of proving \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d like treason or bribery. In this \ncase, unlike in other impeachments, no crime was alleged. Although there may be \ncircumstances where a crime isn\u2019t necessary for a president to be impeached, to \nbe impeached under such a circumstance would require meeting an even higher bar,\n and it wasn\u2019t met here. In addition, the House engaged in a rushed process that\n lacked fundamental fairness. The constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley \ncalls it \u201cthe shortest proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the\n narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president.\u201d It was also the only \npurely partisan impeachment in history. Rushing an impeachment case through the \nHouse without due process and giving the Senate a half-baked case to finish set \na dangerous precedent. If the Senate were to convict, it would risk making this \nkind of quick, partisan impeachment in the House a regular occurrence. That \nwould serve only to further deepen the divides that seem to permeate every part \nof our society today. People certainly see this divide in Congress. Many believe\n their elected representatives on both sides of the aisle have lost sight of \nwhat\u2019s important and are focusing on politics and partisanship rather than \nresults for the American people. While the Senate is where this impeachment \nprocess will end, it is also the Senate that is best suited to help turn the \npage and begin a new chapter. We can do that by demonstrating that we can work \ntogether and address the issues our constituents care most about. I believe it \nis possible for both parties to come together for consensus solutions on these \nthree issues: Lowering Prescription Drug Costs. Researchers are producing life-\nchanging medicines, but all that progress does us no good if they\u2019re \nunaffordable. It\u2019s gotten so bad that some Americans have to choose between \npaying their mortgage or rent and being able to afford expensive prescription \ndrugs. In the Senate, three committees have approved legislation intended to \nhelp lower out-of-pocket costs for senior citizens, crack down on the high \nprices set by drug manufacturers and end surprise billing practices that have \ndevastated families with shocking medical bills. The House has its own plan. The\n president wants to get this done and there is no reason we should not be able \nto find common ground here. Improving Skills Training. Everywhere I go in Ohio, \nemployers tell me they need workers who have the skills to fill available jobs \u2014\n well-paying work as welders, coders and health care technicians, all of which \nrequire skills training. I\u2019m working with Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia \nDemocrat, to pass legislation called the JOBS Act to ensure that Pell grants can\n be used to cover short-term training programs for these careers. That would \nhelp fill well-paid, in-demand jobs and get more people off the sidelines and \ninto our economy. This legislation is bipartisan, and ready to go. Combating the\n Addiction Crisis. One area where Congress has worked well together is in \ncombating the opioid epidemic. Significant new federal investment since 2016 is \nmaking a difference. Overdose deaths fell nationwide last year, the first time \nthat\u2019s happened in nearly three decades. Despite this progress, synthetic \nopioids like fentanyl remain a huge problem, and we\u2019ve seen a resurgence of \npsychostimulants like crystal meth and cocaine. We\u2019re working on bipartisan \nlegislation to address these deadly threats. And there\u2019s more we can do, from \ninfrastructure to retirement security to protecting our national parks. If \nCongress acts we can begin to re-instill faith in our institutions and bridge \nthe growing partisan divide. In these highly partisan times, it\u2019s easy for both \nsides of the aisle to retreat even further into their ideological camps. But for\n the sake of the country, let\u2019s look for what unites us instead. Rob Portman \n(@senrobportman) is a Republican senator from Ohio.

It was all new. I asked Nonnie, were\n there any totem poles raised in the village in her lifetime, and she said no, \nand she was born in 1895. [SAWING] Today, there are few carvers. This boy may be\n one of the last. I saw the old totem poles at the museums, and I saw them in \nphotographs, and I\u2019d come home and there was nothing. This village here, right \nfrom the way down this end of the town right through here, totem pole. Lot of \nit, in my time, and up in the other village, the same way. Ministry says, if \nthey don\u2019t get rid of these totem poles, you never go to heaven. That\u2019s what the\n minister told the Indians. So they want all Indians get together, cut all the \ntotem poles down, and burn them up. Cut them all down, cut them in, oh, about, \noh, four-foot lengths, something you can lift. And cut them all up, and split \nthem, and make big fire and burn them. I used to help too. I wanted to go to \nheaven. Our children heard the song before they were born, Haida singing. I \ndidn\u2019t hear any Haida songs until I was 16. I would go and visit the elders, and\n they seemed really kind of not connecting to anything. And I could feel the \nsadness, and I wanted to create an occasion for them to celebrate one more time.\n That was the moment I committed to carving the totem pole. After I made the \ncommitment to carve the pole, I had no idea in what was involved, and I remember\n getting a phone call from my dad. He said, \u201cI found a log for you.\u201d I said, \n\u201cOh, yeah, right. I need the log.\u201d And I remember not even wanting to look at \nthe log. I was so terrified. And I said, \u201cHoly shit\u201d when I saw the log. I \ndidn\u2019t know how to work on that scale. I was only carving argillite totem poles \nthen. Think of how bland it would be if we didn\u2019t know how to dance, we didn\u2019t \nknow how to sing, we didn\u2019t know how to carve poles. We need those kinds of \nthings in our life, and they\u2019re gifts to everybody. On one of my trips back \nhome, I knocked on every door in the village in Masset to see if there was \nanything left from the classical period, see if anybody had anything. And that\u2019s\n when I found one storage box. When I saw it, I was just blown away by it, and I\n took it home, and I \u2014 I put it beside my bed and slept with it. I was so taken \nby it, by having this one object that survived this whole dark period. There was\n really a void, but I didn\u2019t realize the scale of that void. When I learned to \ncarve, I just learned from Robert. He made it easier. He visited all the elders.\n They taught him the songs and dances. He taught us. He offered me $15 a day. \n[LAUGHING] I mean, I was 14 years old. That\u2019s a lot of money, right? Working on \nthe pole was a pretty amazing experience for me, just \u2019cause it\u2019s all new to me.\n It\u2019s grasping to learn of our culture. These are Raven rattles. I had a dream \nabout Raven rattles. We use them in our Raven dance, and they just move. \n[CLACKING] Spirit of Gossip. Gaagiit is a supernatural being. Tsinii talked \nabout Gaagiit as a person whose spirit is too strong to die. I like to equate \nour spirit as being too strong to die, and that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019re still here.\n There was a couple of people that were saying, \u201cWhy do you want to bring those \nold things back?\u201d That really just came from pain. The pain that they went \nthrough. I mean, I cried when I heard that. But it didn\u2019t stop us. And those \nsame people were there celebrating with us. Ho! Heave! The village is made up of\n two clans, Eagle and Raven. To do this traditionally, either an Eagle clan has \nthe pole raising, or Raven clan. I wanted the whole village to get involved, and\n the only way to have that is to have both clans working together. Old Masset, \nit\u2019s just like a beehive. Everybody from the different clans has their work to \ndo, like the old days. I remember being one of the pullers on the rope, and \nTsinii was there guiding us. He said, \u201cRobert, that totem pole doesn\u2019t belong to\n you anymore. It belongs to them.\u201d So I \u2014 I stepped back. There was a \nconstruction crew there, and they had a crane, and they offered to raise the \npole with their crane. And I mentioned it in one of the meetings, and they said,\n \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to do it the old way.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize how much ceremony was \nconnected to the art until that moment. My grandparents and their generation \ncoming together, and they all told stories, and from those stories, that became \nthe recipe for the pole raising. [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT] Uncle Victor said, \n\u201cRobert, Tsinii wants to talk with you.\u201d So Tsinii said, \u201cYou have to get the \ntools now and start the ceremony.\u201d [CHANTING] When I was chanting, I was in a \ndifferent realm. And it also marked the completion of the pole. [INDISTINCT \nANNOUNCEMENT] [CHATTER] Ho! Heave! I felt really good. I just thought, you know,\n every time they raise the pole, say about another six inches to a foot, and \nthen they braced it, I thought it was just going to come back down and just \nfall. Ho! Heave! Pull, Eagles! Pull! Heave! Ho! Heave! Ho! Heave! [DRUMMING AND \nAPPLAUSE] [DRUMMING] I think it was a good thing. I think it\u2019s one of the \nhighlights in my life. And yet the sorrow in knowing that, possibly, it\u2019s gone \nfor good. We\u2019re trying to pick up something and hold on to it, but there\u2019s maybe\n not enough to hold on to. You know, it was ground zero. Couldn\u2019t have been \ntimed any better. Some of the old people showed up \u2014 [CRYING] There was Tsinii. \nHe had a toy drum. And some of the old people showed up with paper headpieces. \nWhen I talk about ground zero, it couldn\u2019t go any lower because of the laws that\n governed us, the beauty, and our will to participate in ceremony, participate \nin our song and dance, the very thing that fills the spirit. [MUSIC PLAYING] \nThree generations, and they could work together and make it happen. We\u2019re so \nlucky that they were there. [SINGING AND DRUMMING] The pole was important \nbecause it was a deliberate action. It was deliberate bringing back of those \u2014 \nthat part of our life. The carvers at home sitting and carving the argillite \u2014 \nit was watching my great-grandmother put old blankets on the windows so that \npeople couldn\u2019t see in, and they\u2019d sing the old songs and play the drum. All of \nthat, not just the pole. I didn\u2019t think of it as a start of something. I just \nsaw it as a celebration for the old people. [APPLAUSE] You know, I was just a \nyoung smart aleck kid thinking I was going to teach elders something. [LAUGHING]\n But it turned around. It was the other way around. [SINGING AND DRUMMING] \n[MUSIC PLAYING] Video by Christopher Auchter Mr. Auchter is a filmmaker. This \nfilm is part of a special Op-Docs series of short documentaries at the 2020 \nSundance Film Festival. In the late 19th century, the Canadian government \noutlawed the cultural practices of Indigenous people. Potlatches, a central \nceremony where totem poles were raised, were banned in 1885. The ceremonies were\n driven underground, and totem poles \u2014 pillars of Pacific Northwest Indigenous \nculture \u2014 were destroyed or taken away. The Potlatch ban was lifted in 1951, but\n many traditions were deeply affected. Until 1969. That summer, 22-year-old \nRobert Davidson and his brother, Reg Davidson, led the carving of the first \ntotem pole raised in their small Canadian town in nearly a century. As Haida \npeople, they returned to their community a pole monumental in scale and \nsignificance. A Haida renaissance had begun. A 1970 film titled \u201cThis Was the \nTime\u201d documented that occasion, but it left a lot unsaid. With access to the \nsame archive, the Haida filmmaker Christopher Auchter captures the legacy of \nthat bold act of defiance in the short documentary above.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Let\u2019s Quit Fetishizing the Single-Family Home \nCalifornia\u2019s lawmakers once again failed to allow more housing in the state. \nThey\u2019re afraid to accept the single-family home is outdated. By Farhad Manjoo \nOpinion Columnist When my family emigrated from our native South Africa to \nSouthern California in the 1980s, my parents, my sister and I fell hard for this\n state\u2019s endless suburban sprawl. To the four of us, the acres of subdivisions \nthat had been mushrooming up across California since World War II were the \nembodiment of everything we\u2019d been promised about America. A bigger-than-enough \nhouse, a two-car garage and a backyard of brilliant green lawn \u2014 this was the \nCalifornia Dream we\u2019d seen on TV. By the time I got to middle school, my \nimmigrant family was able to afford a house with a yard of our own \u2014 back then, \nCalifornia really was the land of milk and honey \u2014 and I spent my youth in the \nsun-drenched suburbs. It was a fine place to grow up; in the mass-produced \n\u201clittle boxes made of ticky-tacky\u201d that stretch across California and much of \nAmerica, I found comfort, safety and a crucial sense of belonging in the \nAmerican landscape. And yet, wistful though I may remain for my suburban-sprawl \nchildhood, these days I find myself continually amazed and befuddled by my \nstate\u2019s insane fetishization of an anachronistic model of urban development. Why\n \u2014 when the case for some better way of living has become so painfully obvious \u2014\n can\u2019t California quit propping up its endless rows of single-family houses? Why\n can\u2019t so much of America? And what level of extreme unlivability is it going to\n take to finally convince us that there isn\u2019t enough space for all of us to live\n as if space is infinite? Last week, California lawmakers rejected an effort to \noverride restrictive zoning regulations across the state for the third year in a\n row. Most of the land available for residential development in California is \nzoned for single-family homes, according to researchers at U.C. Berkeley\u2019s \nTurner Center for Housing Innovation; the typical California city allows \nmultifamily developments like apartments, townhouses and duplexes on less than a\n quarter of its land. Senate Bill 50, devised by Scott Wiener, a Democrat from \nSan Francisco, would have allowed higher-density housing near public \ntransportation lines and job centers, fostering affordability and sustainability\n in a state that desperately needs both. In previous attempts, Wiener\u2019s idea was\n criticized for exacerbating gentrification and handing over development plans \nfrom local officials to state bureaucrats. This year, Wiener significantly \namended the bill to address the critics\u2019 concerns. The latest version offered \ngreater control to local officials and delayed the legislation\u2019s impact in low-\nincome areas sensitive to gentrification. But again, the bill couldn\u2019t make it \nthrough. S.B. 50 attracted fierce opposition from lawmakers representing some of\n the state\u2019s ritziest suburbs and its largest cities. Even some of the bill\u2019s \nputative supporters, like Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is falling well short of his \ncampaign promise to spur the development of 3.5 million new housing units by \n2025, offered only tepid endorsements. I suspect that the reluctance stems from \na reality that many politicians would prefer to avoid accepting: The reign of \nthe single-family home is over. Whatever its habitable charms and nostalgic \nappeal, the single-family home is out of step with the future. In an era \nconstrained by sustainability and affordability, a big house with a backyard \nshould be a rarity. Much of California is straining under its own success: We \nhave too many people and too few places for them to live, offered at too-high \nprices, in too many areas touched-by-climate-change-related menaces, like \nwildfires, all too far from where people work. And the solution is so painfully \nobvious it feels almost reductive to point it out: Make it legal to build more \nhousing that houses more people. Increasing density by replacing single-family \nhomes with multifamily ones would be a boon to our efforts to address climate \nchange, and it would help with affordability. But if that is too practical a \nselling point, let me offer a couple more politically salient ones. First, there\n is nothing especially admirable about the development of single-family zoning \nin America. Though the policy is now defended as a way to maintain the ineffable\n \u201clocal character\u201d of neighborhoods, single-family zoning has a history in \nsegregation. As the historian Richard Rothstein has documented, single-family \nzoning was one of the many ways white homeowners and politicians kept African-\nAmericans out of suburbs. And second: We can move on from single-family housing \nto something better for everyone. A few years ago, shut out of the skyrocketing \nmarket for single-family homes in our Northern California suburb, my wife and I \nbought a townhouse. At first we thought of it as a starter home \u2014 we\u2019d just had \nour second child, and it felt like we could slum it in a townhouse for a bit \nbefore we could move into the dream of a place with a backyard. That dream now \nlooks prohibitive: Houses with backyards in my neck of the woods require \ntech-I.P.O. levels of insane wealth. But you know what? I don\u2019t feel so bad. Our\n attached townhouse, on a piece of land a small fraction of the size of a \nsingle-family home, is less of a burden on the environment, and it is just the \nright size for the four of us. It\u2019s also just as loving and pleasant a place for\n my kids to grow up in as my own suburban manse was for me. At some point, \nrecently, I realized that I no longer fantasized about ever having a backyard \u2014 \nmy dream home is now a townhouse, and if it\u2019s good enough for me, perhaps it \ncould be good enough for others in my state, too.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by I Voted for Trump, and I Believe He May Be Guilty of \nBribery The president\u2019s defenders are wrong. By James D. Harmon Jr. Mr. Harmon \nis a former federal prosecutor. I am a Republican and former federal prosecutor \nwho voted for Donald Trump in 2016. But I was deeply dismayed by the way his \nlawyers defended his misbegotten dealings with Ukraine during the Senate \nimpeachment trial. Unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, I believe the president might \nwell be guilty of breaking the law. Even without the additional witnesses and \ndocuments that the Senate Republicans refused to subpoena, the evidence \navailable to date has established a prima facie case of bribery, a felony under \nfederal law, against Mr. Trump. The articles of impeachment do not use the word \nbribery, but the House Judiciary Committee did in a report, and for good reason:\n The proof is there, for the following reasons. If the president corruptly \ndemanded or sought anything of value to influence an official act, then he would\n be guilty of bribery. \u201cIn other words, for bribery there must be a quid pro quo\n \u2014 a specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an \nofficial act,\u201d the Supreme Court held in United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of\n California in 1999. Federal courts around the country have interpreted \n\u201canything of value\u201d to include intangible things \u2014 in this case, the \nannouncement by Ukraine of an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden\n and his son Hunter. The official action in question to be offered in exchange \nwas the release of American military assistance to Ukraine, a country at war \nwith Russia. That military assistance was unlawfully withheld in contravention \nof the president\u2019s constitutional obligation to \u201cfaithfully execute\u201d the law as \nCongress enacts it, the United States Government Accountability Office found. In\n fleshing out the constitutional requirement of high crimes and misdemeanors, \nthe first article of impeachment tracks the language of bribery, saying that Mr.\n Trump sought to pressure the government of Ukraine \u201cfor corrupt purposes in \npursuit of personal political benefit.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, the Harvard law \nprofessor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, asserted that Mr. Trump can be convicted \nonly for conduct \u201cakin\u201d to bribery and treason. Mr. Dershowitz has been wrong on\n the law many times in this trial, but even by his standard, the articles of \nimpeachment express an impeachable offense. The key evidence establishes several\n things. First, as The Times has reported, John Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s former \nnational security adviser, says in a forthcoming book that Mr. Trump directly \ntold him that he wanted to withhold military aid to Ukraine until President \nVolodymyr Zelensky announced an investigation of the Bidens. (Mr. Trump has \ndenied that.) This so clearly appears to be a quid pro quo that Mr. Trump\u2019s own \nambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, actually called it such. \nSecond, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, told The Times that \nthe president fired Marie Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine after she tried \nto impede the efforts to investigate the Bidens. And finally, Mr. Trump, during \na phone call on July 25, asked Mr. Zelensky for a \u201cfavor\u201d to open investigations\n not only of the Bidens but also into a widely debunked theory that Ukraine had \nmeddled in the 2016 election. Despite all this, the Republican-controlled Senate\n on Wednesday appears all but certain to acquit Mr. Trump. The nation has been \ndenied the chance to witness the impeachment managers and Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers \nfully interrogate or defend his behavior. The Senate had a constitutional duty \nto hold a real trial. Instead we got a show trial. One more thing concerns me. \nDuring the House investigation, Mr. Sondland testified that Mr. Trump told him: \n\u201cI want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.\u201d \nTo me, a former federal prosecutor who has successfully argued cases before the \nSupreme Court and handled many organized crime cases, the words \u201cdo the right \nthing\u201d recalled the way mob bosses made an offer that could not be refused \u2014 the\n threat and reward clear but unstated, without explicit incriminating language. \nTo those who find nothing wrong with the president\u2019s words, I would just note \nthat, according to Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy in Evans v. United \nStates in 1992, an official \u201cneed not state the quid pro quo in express terms\u201d \nfor a crime to have been committed. I say all this as a Republican who worked \nfor President Ronald Reagan and voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 because I believed \nthat he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would \u201csay what the law is,\u201d \nnot try to make it. Since then Mr. Trump has done several things that have made \nme question my choice, including asserting last year that Article II of the \nConstitution gave him \u201cthe right to do whatever I want as president.\u201d That is \nnot the Constitution I know. As a freshly minted Army lieutenant, I took an oath\n at West Point that I would \u201cto the best of my ability, preserve, protect and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d President Trump took the same \noath when he became president. He should abide by it. James D. Harmon, Jr., a \nformer city and federal prosecutor, was executive director of the President\u2019s \nCommission on Organized Crime during the Reagan administration.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by This Will Come Back to Haunt Trump and His Enablers \nThe president was acquitted by the Senate, but the American people are smarter. \nBy Neal K. Katyal and Joshua A. Geltzer The authors are law professors at \nGeorgetown. The vote to acquit President Trump was a dark day for the Senate. \nUninterested in hearing from witnesses (and likely scared by what they would \nsay), uncritical of outrageous legal arguments made by the president\u2019s lawyers \nand apparently unconcerned about the damage Mr. Trump has done to the integrity \nof America\u2019s elections, a majority of senators insisted on looking the other way\n and letting him off the hook for a classic impeachable offense: abuse of public\n office for private gain. But while the Senate got it wrong, the American people\n learned what\u2019s right. This impeachment was about much more than the final vote \nof 100 senators. It was a process, and that process yielded a public education \nof extraordinary value. While the Senate may emerge from the process weakened, \nthe American people, on the whole, emerge from it strengthened by a sharpened \nsense of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong for an American president; of what it \nmeans for a political party to show moral courage; of what it looks like when \ndedicated public servants speak truth no matter the consequences; and of the \nimportance of whistle-blowers for ensuring accountability. The past few months \nhave shown Americans a president who abused the public trust for his personal \nbenefit. Before this process, we suspect, few Americans had dwelled on the \nquestion of when it crosses the line for a president to exploit for private \npolitical gain the tools of national power placed in his or her hands. But \nimpeachment has forced Americans to confront it \u2014 a question, it turns out, that\n was central to the framers\u2019 decision to include impeachment in our \nConstitution. And Americans overwhelmingly reject what Mr. Trump did, with 75 \npercent saying in December that his Ukraine extortion scheme was wrong (a view \nthat even some Republican senators have endorsed). That\u2019s huge: For all that \ndivides Americans today, this is a dominant consensus on what it means to abuse \npublic office and distort American democracy. Americans have also seen that, \ndespite the intense pessimism and even disillusionment that many feel about \npolitics, a political party still can show moral courage \u2014 regardless of the \npolitical costs. The Democrats were told constantly that impeachment would hurt \nthem in November. Mr. Trump himself has boasted that it will, and what\u2019s more he\n has relished the chance to claim exoneration and to take a victory lap at the \nsame time as Democratic hopefuls began duking it out in earnest in the \nprimaries. The Democrats knew all this, and what\u2019s more, they knew they faced an\n uphill battle: That\u2019s what the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds \nSenate majority to convict imposes from the beginning. But they still did the \nright thing. They called out impropriety so glaring that it could not be \nsuffered in silence. And they reminded all of us that a political party can \npursue what\u2019s right over what\u2019s expedient \u2014 and so can a lone politician, as \nSenator Mitt Romney showed. Americans saw on vivid display another form of \ncourage: the incredible bravery of public servants who testified before the \nHouse of Representatives, the nation and the world \u2014 people like Lt. Col. \nAlexander Vindman and Dr. Fiona Hill. They did so despite the gag orders issued \nby Mr. Trump to disobey Congress. They did so knowing they\u2019d face death threats.\n They did so not knowing whether their testimony would yield the president\u2019s \nimpeachment or removal. And they spoke up because they believed in truth as an \nend in itself. That\u2019s a reminder, in our disinformation-fueled times, that \ncandor is a value we must recover. And it\u2019s a lesson for the American people \nthat those who serve our government by working long hours for little pay and \neven less glory aren\u2019t the \u201cdeep state\u201d that Mr. Trump denounces but, instead, \npatriots. Americans also received a lesson in the critical importance of \nwhistle-blowers in holding our government to account. The role of whistle-\nblowers is as old as the government itself, dating back to the Continental \nCongress. But never has their necessity been put on display as clearly as when a\n courageous whistle-blower filed the complaint that, ultimately, led to the \nexposure of Mr. Trump\u2019s Ukraine extortion bid. In this, Americans can see why \nthe United States has been protecting whistle-blowers by law since 1777: Through\n proper channels, they can provide internal accountability that other actors \u2014 \nlike Congress and the press \u2014 often can\u2019t achieve, especially when an \nadministration like the current one so relentlessly tries to hide its misdeeds \nand resist oversight. Remember also that the investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s \nUkraine extortion scandal isn\u2019t over. Trump\u2019s own lawyers insisted that key \nwitnesses like John Bolton should testify in the House, rather than in the \nSenate. And Mr. Trump\u2019s entire defense was that the people should decide in \nNovember. So be it. The House has a continuing duty, as part of its oversight \nand legislative functions, to get to the bottom of what happened so that \nNovember will be a fully informed choice. Recall that it was Mr. Trump\u2019s central\n defense that there weren\u2019t witnesses who testified that they saw, firsthand, \nhis extortion of Ukraine. The House now has an opportunity to do so. And it \nmust, according to Mr. Trump\u2019s own arguments, so that the November election can \nserve the function that Mr. Trump, in warding off impeachment, claimed it \nshould. President Trump may remain in office for now, but he now serves an \nAmerican people that\u2019s stronger for the journey our country has just taken. It\u2019s\n a country energized by a sense of when a president has abused his office; \nreminded of how a political party can choose morality over political expediency;\n enlightened by the display of candor from public servants; and educated about \nthe crucial nature of whistle-blowers and thus of the legal protections afforded\n them. Regrettably, one political party has resisted acknowledging, let alone \nembracing, these lessons. That\u2019s a danger to the Republic. And it\u2019s one that \nAmericans now need to address through their public advocacy, their community \nengagement \u2014 and, ultimately, at the voting booth in November. Neal K. Katyal \n(@neal_katyal), a former acting solicitor general of the United States and the \nauthor of \u201cImpeach: The Case Against Donald Trump,\u201d and Joshua A.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by In Private, Republicans Admit They Acquitted Trump \nOut of Fear One journalist remarked to me, \u201cHow in the world can these senators \nwalk around here upright when they have no backbone?\u201d By Sherrod Brown Mr. Brown\n is a Democratic senator from Ohio. Not guilty. Not guilty. In the United States\n Senate, like in many spheres of life, fear does the business. Think back to the\n fall of 2002, just a few weeks before that year\u2019s crucial midterm elections, \nwhen the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq was up for a vote.\n A year after the 9/11 attacks, hundreds of members of the House and the Senate \nwere about to face the voters of a country still traumatized by terrorism. \nSenator Patty Murray, a thoughtful Democrat from Washington State, still \nremembers \u201cthe fear that dominated the Senate leading up to the Iraq war.\u201d \u201cYou \ncould feel it then,\u201d she told me, \u201cand you can feel that fear now\u201d \u2014 chiefly \namong Senate Republicans. For those of us who, from the start, questioned the \nwisdom of the Iraq war, our sense of isolation surely wasn\u2019t much different from\n the loneliness felt in the 1950s by Senator Herbert Lehman of New York, who \nconfronted Joe McCarthy\u2019s demagogy only to be abandoned by so many of his \ncolleagues. Nor was it so different from what Senator George McGovern must have \nfelt when he announced his early opposition to the Vietnam War and was then \nlabeled a traitor by many inside and outside of Congress. History has indeed \ntaught us that when it comes to the instincts that drive us, fear has no rival. \nAs the lead House impeachment manager, Representative Adam Schiff, has noted, \nRobert Kennedy spoke of how \u201cmoral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in \nbattle.\u201d Playing on that fear, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, \nsought a quick impeachment trial for President Trump with as little attention to\n it as possible. Reporters, who usually roam the Capitol freely, have been \ncordoned off like cattle in select areas. Mr. McConnell ordered limited camera \nviews in the Senate chamber so only presenters \u2014 not absent senators \u2014 could be \nspotted. And barely a peep from Republican lawmakers. One journalist remarked to\n me, \u201cHow in the world can these senators walk around here upright when they \nhave no backbone?\u201d Fear has a way of bending us. Late in the evening on day four\n of the trial I saw it, just 10 feet across the aisle from my seat at Desk 88, \nwhen Mr. Schiff told the Senate: \u201cCBS News reported last night that a Trump \nconfidant said that Republican senators were warned, \u2018Vote against the president\n and your head will be on a pike.\u2019\u201d The response from Republicans was immediate \nand furious. Several groaned and protested and muttered, \u201cNot true.\u201d But pike or\n no pike, Mr. Schiff had clearly struck a nerve. (In the words of Lizzo: truth \nhurts.) Of course, the Republican senators who have covered for Mr. Trump love \nwhat he delivers for them. But Vice President Mike Pence would give them the \nsame judges, the same tax cuts, the same attacks on workers\u2019 rights and the \nenvironment. So that\u2019s not really the reason for their united chorus of \u201cnot \nguilty.\u201d  For the stay-in-office-at-all-cost representatives and senators, fear \nis the motivator. They are afraid that Mr. Trump might give them a nickname like\n \u201cLow Energy Jeb\u201d and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d or that he might tweet about their \ndisloyalty. Or \u2014 worst of all \u2014 that he might come to their state to campaign \nagainst them in the Republican primary. They worry: \u201cWill the hosts on Fox \nattack me?\u201d \u201cWill the mouthpieces on talk radio go after me?\u201d \u201cWill the Twitter \ntrolls turn their followers against me?\u201d My colleagues know they all just might.\n There\u2019s an old Russian proverb: The tallest blade of grass is the first cut by \nthe scythe. In private, many of my colleagues agree that the president is \nreckless and unfit. They admit his lies. And they acknowledge what he did was \nwrong. They know this president has done things Richard Nixon never did. And \nthey know that more damning evidence is likely to come out. So watching the \nmental contortions they perform to justify their votes is painful to behold: \nThey claim that calling witnesses would have meant a never-ending trial. They \ntell us they\u2019ve made up their minds, so why would we need new evidence? They say\n to convict this president now would lead to the impeachment of every future \npresident \u2014 as if every president will try to sell our national security to the \nhighest bidder. I have asked some of them, \u201cIf the Senate votes to acquit, what \nwill you do to keep this president from getting worse?\u201d Their responses have \nbeen shrugs and sheepish looks. They stop short of explicitly saying that they \nare afraid. We all want to think that we always stand up for right and fight \nagainst wrong. But history does not look kindly on politicians who cannot fathom\n a fate worse than losing an upcoming election. They might claim fealty to their\n cause \u2014 those tax cuts \u2014 but often it\u2019s a simple attachment to power that keeps\n them captured. As Senator Murray said on the Senate floor in 2002, \u201cWe can act \nout of fear\u201d or \u201cwe can stick to our principles.\u201d Unfortunately, in this Senate,\n fear has had its way. In November, the American people will have theirs. \nSherrod Brown (@SenSherrodBrown), a Democrat, is the senior United States \nsenator from Ohio and is the author of \u201cDesk 88: Eight Progressive Senators Who \nChanged America.\u201d The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to\n the editor.
