            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by What the Editorial Board Really Thought of the \nDemocratic Candidates Members say what impressed, disappointed and surprised \nthem. By Spencer Bokat-Lindell Mr. Bokat-Lindell is a writer in The New York \nTimes Opinion section. This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can\n sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays. On Sunday, The New York \nTimes editorial board endorsed Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar for the \nDemocratic presidential nomination. In the words of Kathleen Kingsbury, the \ndeputy editorial page editor, \u201cThe endorsement process is an opportunity to ask \nhard questions and engage candidates in the kind of prolonged back-and-forth \nthat reveals insights readers aren\u2019t always privy to but have a right to know \nabout.\u201d To reach their decision, the board sat down for extended conversations \nwith nine of the Democratic candidates. I asked some of the editorial board \nmembers about that process, and how the interviews might help voters make up \ntheir minds as the primary approaches. What answer, from any candidate, most \nsurprised you? Alex Kingsbury: I was, and remain, impressed that Bernie Sanders \nrefused to answer the question (asked of all candidates) about who broke their \nheart. It may have been one of the few questions that a candidate simply refused\n to answer. His was the correct answer in that there are some things that even \npolitical leaders need not address in public. But it takes a certain kind of \nperson not to answer a question, especially in a journalistic setting. Most \noften, the rule is, \u201cAnswer the question you wished had been asked,\u201d which is \nwhat almost everyone does. Points to Senator Sanders for knowing when not to \nplay ball. Michelle Cottle: I wasn\u2019t expecting Pete Buttigieg to admit that he \nfeels as though he has \u201cless room to be emotive\u201d than some other candidates. \nBinyamin Appelbaum: I was surprised that the former Massachusetts governor Deval\n Patrick continues to defend Ameriquest, one of the nation\u2019s largest subprime \nlenders in the years before the financial crisis. The company\u2019s predatory \nlending practices resulted in thousands of foreclosures, not to mention huge \nsettlements, but when I asked Mr. Patrick, who served on the company\u2019s board, \nwhether he still thought of Ameriquest as a good company, he praised its good \nintentions. Lauren Kelley: Mayor Pete telling us he hadn\u2019t heard of the Mayo \nPete meme. How is that possible? Mara Gay: We asked all of the candidates who \nhad broken their hearts. Senator Elizabeth Warren said her first husband did. \nKnowing the context behind their divorce \u2014 she has said he didn\u2019t support her \ncareer ambitions \u2014 I found the answer to be brave. It takes courage to tell \nthese stories, especially as a woman running for president. It\u2019s clear she has \nguts. Nick Fox: When Joe Biden was discussing a meeting with tech leaders about \nprotecting intellectual property, he said that \u201cone of the little creeps sitting\n around that table\u201d had \u201ctold me he was an artist because he was able to come up\n with games to teach you how to kill people.\u201d It\u2019s not often that you hear a pol\n refer to some of the most powerful American business owners as \u201ccreeps.\u201d Not \nthat I have any problem with that. Was your opinion of any of the candidates \nsignificantly changed by meeting with them? AK: I was more impressed after \nmeeting Elizabeth Warren for the endorsements. I\u2019d met her several times before \nas a journalist in Massachusetts. She\u2019s come a long way as a politician. Mayor \nButtigieg was more impressive in person than on TV. Tom Steyer less so. I found \nAndrew Yang the most enjoyable in terms of his willingness to say what was on \nhis mind. MC: Yes. BA: My pre-interview impression of Andrew Yang was heavily \ncolored by his debate appearances, which felt to me like a high-concept comedy \nroutine in which almost every answer ended up in the same place: his proposal to\n send every American a monthly check. In person, however, I found him very \nimpressive. He was both thoughtful and empathetic, not to mention genuinely \nfunny. I think his platform is flawed, but I have a lot of respect for him \u2014 and\n I hope he finds a way to remain involved in public life. LK: I didn\u2019t have much\n of an opinion about Cory Booker going into our interview with him. I came out \nof the room thinking he was a much better candidate than his poll numbers \nindicated. MG: I was unprepared for Andrew Yang\u2019s thoughtfulness around his \nuniversal basic income proposal. The measure is regressive, and far too small a \nresponse to the income inequality seen in the United States today. But when Mr. \nYang spoke about his vision for the proposal as a way to reignite \nentrepreneurialism and breathe new life into communities that have long ago lost\n manufacturing jobs, it was inspiring. He brings an energy and compassion to the\n race I found infectious. I was expecting a \u201cbro,\u201d but found someone far more \ninteresting. NF: As were many of my colleagues, I was impressed by Mr. Yang\u2019s \nthoughtfulness and by how much I enjoyed meeting with him. But I was also \nshocked by how obliviously ill-prepared Deval Patrick was. What line of \nquestioning did you find most revealing of a candidate\u2019s fitness for the \npresidency? AK: Since I was asking about foreign policy, I found the thinness of\n the responses nearly disqualifying for every candidate besides Joe Biden. \n(Senator Warren had a few strong ideas, too). If any of these candidates \nanswered questions about health care, say, the way they talked about \nAfghanistan, they\u2019d be laughed off the debate stage. MC: It\u2019s always interesting\n to see how candidates handle criticism \u2014 of themselves, their policy ideas, \ntheir campaign strategies. It can help give you a sense of their temperament and\n how rigid they are. BA: Most of the candidates make a convincing case that \ntheir heart is in the right place, but few have a convincing grasp on the nature\n of the job they\u2019re seeking. It\u2019s fine to talk about legislation, but the \npresident\u2019s primary power is as regulator-in-chief. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s \nunderstanding of regulatory power, and how to use it, is one of her strongest \nqualities. LK: This isn\u2019t a specific line of questioning, but I found it most \nrevealing watching the candidates respond to questions that they weren\u2019t \nprepared to answer. Some of them spat out a campaign slogan and changed the \nsubject, while others turned the problem over in their head and gave a \nthoughtful answer. (And some did both!) I think that if you want to be \npresident, you really need to be able to do the latter. The presidency is \nbasically four to eight years of dealing with urgent and unexpected crises, \nright? NF: I don\u2019t know about \u201cfitness,\u201d but what I thought was most telling was\n the way they dealt with questions about inequality, which will be central to \nthe Democratic campaign and the general election. Some were surprisingly vague \nabout actual policy plans, particularly on taxation. Going into the interviews, \ndid you have criteria for what might disqualify a candidate? (And did any of the\n candidates disqualify themselves?) AK: See above. MC: No hard and fast litmus \ntests. But I tend to be skeptical of candidates who avoid policy or strategy \nspecifics and parry questions about how they\u2019ll approach the job with vague \npromises to \u201cchange Washington\u201d or \u201cremake the system.\u201d BA: The interviews are \njust one way in which we evaluate candidates; I guess I can imagine exchanges \nthat would be, as such, disqualifying, but I\u2019m not sure we had any. The \ncandidates I regarded as plausible presidents when they entered the room, I \nstill regarded as plausible presidents when they left. LK: I didn\u2019t; I think you\n know a disqualifying answer when you hear one. MG: None. I tried to walk in \nwith an open mind. NF: A lack of seriousness and depth. A reliance on platitude,\n slogans and pandering. Which candidate of those who have dropped out would you \nhave liked to interview? AK: I would have liked to interview Tulsi Gabbard and \nMichael Bloomberg. Both declined. I don\u2019t really consider Ms. Gabbard a \nDemocrat, in the same way that Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t really a Democrat. But she \nis only one of two people (including Mr. Sanders) who is a viable option for \ntruly antiwar voters. I\u2019m not one, but I find it discouraging that Senator \nSanders and Representative Gabbard are the only true antiwar options. MC: Kamala\n Harris. We came so close! BA: I\u2019m glad we were able to interview Cory Booker \nbefore he dropped out. His grasp of the nation\u2019s problems and opportunities \nresonated with me, as I hope that some of his plans \u2014 notably his proposal for \nbaby bonds \u2014 are picked up by other candidates. The person I most wish we had \ninterviewed is still in the race: Michael Bloomberg, who declined to come speak \nwith us. LK: I was bummed that we didn\u2019t get to talk to Kamala Harris or Juli\u00e1n \nCastro. They were both interesting candidates with creative ideas about how to \nprotect reproductive rights. And I think they would have been fun to talk to. \nMG: Kamala Harris dropped out of the race moments before she was scheduled to \nmeet with us. It was disappointing because I would have liked to ask her about \nwhat she was hearing from voters on the campaign trail, and her theory about why\n her candidacy didn\u2019t gain the traction it needed. NF: Juli\u00e1n Castro obviously \ndidn\u2019t have a chance, but I would have liked to have gotten a better sense of \nwho he is. He is going to be a player. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s refusal to meet with us \u2014\n in his own city \u2014 did not speak well of him. What about this endorsement \nprocess do you think is most valuable to readers and voters who are already \npaying close attention to the race? AK: Anything that\u2019s on the record is a \nservice to voters, in my view. MC: Ninety minutes of extended questioning is \nbound to knock the candidates off their talking points and stump speeches at \nleast a couple of times. Though it was harder with some than others. BA: I think\n there are several plausible candidates in this field, each with strengths and \nflaws. We made a choice, but more than that, I hope we helped to clarify the \ntrade-offs confronting Democratic voters, and I hope that helps people make \ntheir own choices. LK: We had the luxury of time with the candidates \u2014 many of \nthem revealed more about themselves in that room than they\u2019re able to on a \ndebate stage or in a stump speech. MG: I hope we can convince voters to \nchallenge their assumptions about who is electable and why. And I hope that in \npulling back the curtain a bit on the endorsement process, we can give Americans\n a better sense of the role of editorial boards, and newspapers in general, in a\n democratic society. That hasn\u2019t been super-transparent in the past. I hope this\n helps remove some of the mystery. Do you have thoughts on the editorial board\u2019s\n endorsement?

MORE ON\n THE CHOICE Read the editorial board\u2019s interviews with all the candidates. \nCurious about how other readers reacted to the endorsement? Here are two \ncollections of responses. Listen to the pop-up podcast about how the editorial \nboard made its decision. WHAT YOU\u2019RE SAYING Here\u2019s what readers had to say about\n the last edition: The spat between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Richard\n from Massachusetts: \u201cFrankly I am going to support both Sanders and Warren and \nam not in the least interested in this spat. \u2026 Everyone understands both sexism \nand the gender issues around the election of the first female POTUS. That issue \nhas little to do with either of these candidates. What I want to see is both of \nthem work to defeat Biden, Buttigieg and especially the billionaires.\u201d Beulah \nfrom Massachusetts: \u201cI\u2019d like to point out that a Washington Post story \ncorroborates Sanders\u2019s account of their conversation. In future coverage of this\n controversy, I\u2019d like this acknowledged, because it is part of the story.\u201d Bill\n from New Zealand: \u201cThere is a woman who could easily win the general election \nif she could just get past the primaries. Her name is Amy Klobuchar. I like \nWarren, but the issue is not whether a woman can win or not. It is whether \nWarren can win. I don\u2019t think she can. I also don\u2019t think Bernie can.\u201d \nAdvertisement Site Index news opinion arts living more Subscribe Site \nInformation Navigation",

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Biden, Sanders, Social Security and Smears Lying \nabout a rival is bad, even if you don\u2019t like his past positions. By Paul Krugman\n Opinion Columnist While the news media has been focused on the \u201cspat\u201d between \nElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, something much more serious has been taking\n place between the Sanders campaign and Joe Biden. Not to sugarcoat it: The \nSanders campaign has flat-out lied about things Biden said in 2018 about Social \nSecurity, and it has refused to admit the falsehood. This is bad; it is, indeed,\n almost Trumpian. The last thing we need is another president who demonizes and \nlies about anyone who disagrees with him, and can\u2019t admit ever being wrong. \nBiden deserves an apology, now, and Sanders probably needs to find better aides.\n That said \u2014 and this is no excuse for the Sanders camp \u2014 it would be good to \nhave Biden explain why, in the more distant past, he went along with the Beltway\n consensus that Social Security needed to be pared back. First, about that Biden\n smear: In 2018 Biden gave a speech attacking Paul Ryan, the then-speaker of the\n House, for wanting to cut taxes on the rich and pay for those tax cuts by \ncutting Social Security and Medicare. There was nothing in his remarks that \nshould bother progressives. However, a Sanders adviser recently circulated a \nsnippet from the video of the event that made it appear that Biden was actually \nsupporting Ryan\u2019s position and calling for Social Security cuts. A few days \nlater a newsletter from the Sanders campaign quoted Biden out of context and \nmade the same claim. If you want a parallel, it\u2019s as if I were to say, \u201cSome \nwhite nationalists claim that Jews are responsible for all our problems,\u201d and a \npolitical campaign put out a release saying, \u201cKrugman says \u2018Jews are responsible\n for all our problems.\u2019\u201d Biden did make a misstep in his counterattack, \nmislabeling the misrepresented video clip as \u201cdoctored,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean \nhe\u2019s not still due an abject apology. Instead, however, the Sanders campaign has\n doubled down. Rather than admitting that it smeared a rival, the campaign is \ngoing around claiming that Biden has a long record of trying to cut Social \nSecurity. There is, unfortunately, some truth in that claim \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t \nexcuse either the original lie or the refusal to admit error. So, about the \nelement of truth in the criticism of Biden: Once upon a time, there was a \npeculiar consensus among media figures and would-be centrists that the long-run \ncost of entitlement programs was America\u2019s biggest problem, that Social Security\n in particular was in crisis and that something had to be done, with the \nsolution including benefit cuts. This consensus wasn\u2019t based on hard thinking; \nit was about the attitude politicians were expected to display. As I wrote way \nback in 2007, proclaiming a Social Security crisis requiring cuts was seen as a \n\u201cbadge of seriousness,\u201d a way of showing how statesmanlike and tough-minded you \nwere. The candidate I was criticizing, by the way \u2014 the guy I said had been \n\u201cplayed for a sucker\u201d \u2014 was a politician named Barack Obama. But Biden was \ncertainly pulled in by that conventional wisdom, too, so it\u2019s not hard to find \nold quotes in which he suggested possible Social Security cuts in the name of \nfiscal responsibility. But that was then. These days, Biden, like many \nDemocrats, is calling for an expansion of Social Security benefits. That doesn\u2019t\n make his previous statements irrelevant; he should acknowledge that he has \nchanged his position, and his history on the issue is one reason progressives \nworry that, if elected, he might fritter away his political capital in vain \nattempts to reach bipartisan compromise. (His role in passing the draconian 2005\n bankruptcy bill, which got Elizabeth Warren involved in politics, is another.) \nNone of this, however, justifies the Sanders campaign\u2019s lying about recent \nstatements by a man who, after all, may well be the Democratic presidential \nnominee \u2014 and who would, whatever his centrist history, be infinitely more \nprogressive than the current occupant of the White House. And the smearing of \nBiden reinforces the concerns some of us have about Sanders. There has always \nbeen an ugly edge to some of Sanders\u2019s support, a faction of followers who \ndenounce anyone raising questions about his positions \u2014 even Warren! \u2014 as a \ncorrupt capitalist shill. Until now, however, you could argue that Sanders \nhimself wasn\u2019t responsible for the bad behavior of some of his supporters. You \ncan\u2019t make that argument now. The dishonest smears and the doubling down on \nthose smears are coming from the top of the Sanders campaign; even if they \naren\u2019t coming directly out of Sanders\u2019s mouth, he could and should have stopped \nthem. The fact that Sanders isn\u2019t apologizing to Biden and replacing the people \nresponsible says uncomfortable things about his character. I don\u2019t want to go \noverboard here. While there is a Trumpian feel to some of what we\u2019re seeing from\n the Sanders campaign, Bernie Sanders is no Donald Trump. As we\u2019ve just seen, \nthere are some real issues with the people surrounding him, but they\u2019re nothing \nlike Trump\u2019s gang of thugs. And in practice a Sanders presidency, like a Biden \npresidency, would be a vast improvement, morally as well as substantively, on \nwhat we have now. But right now, Sanders and his campaign are behaving badly, \nand they need to be called on it. The Times is committed to publishing a \ndiversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Let Us All Now Weep for Donald Trump In his Senate \ntrial as in all else, he\u2019s a profile in persecution. By Frank Bruni Opinion \nColumnist Donald Trump obviously relishes the role of bully. But his greatest \ntalent by far lies in playing the victim. He\u2019s a victim of Adam Schiff. A victim\n of Nancy Pelosi. A victim of all Democrats, really, and of his own seedy \nhenchmen (Michael Cohen, Lev Parnas) and of the \u201cdeep state\u201d and of the \u201cfake \nnews media\u201d and of the entire establishment, whatever that is. He\u2019s a victim of \nso many forces so many times over that even \u201cmartyr\u201d doesn\u2019t do justice to his \nlot, which is what you get when you multiply Job in the Old Testament by Mel \nGibson in \u201cBraveheart\u201d and add the protagonist of \u201cUnbroken.\u201d No president has \never been treated so badly. I\u2019m not being sarcastic. I\u2019m taking dictation: He \nhas made this exact claim \u2014 repeatedly. His victimhood is front and center in \nhis defense against the articles of impeachment and in the legal papers filed by\n his lawyers on Monday, as his trial in the Senate moved forward. The lawyers \nwrite of a process \u201crigged\u201d against Trump. They portray his Democratic accusers \nas unhinged tormentors, too consumed with his destruction to see how \nunimpeachably he has really behaved. The 171-page document is so soggy with \nTrumpian self-pity it weeps. It\u2019s so bloated with Trumpian hyperbole it waddles.\n On just one of those pages, his lawyers recount how Democrats exercised \n\u201cshameful hypocrisy\u201d as they \u201cconcocted an unheard-of procedure\u201d and held those \ninfamous \u201csecret hearings in a basement bunker\u201d while journalists \u201chappily fed \nthe public a false narrative\u201d and the poor president was denied any rights \nwhatsoever. This is the bodice ripper of political sob stories. It\u2019s a Harlequin\n harangue. It expands on \u2014 and continues in the precise spirit of \u2014 a \npreliminary legal brief that his lawyers filed last weekend. \u201cThe scream of a \nwounded animal\u201d was how two legal experts who contribute to The Atlantic \nassessed that argument. They could as easily have been describing the rest of \nTrump\u2019s presidency, the whole of his political career and much of his life. He\u2019s\n always right and yet always wronged. He demands that we marvel at his \ninvincibility even as we tremble at his degradation. He can vanquish any enemy \u2014\n and his enemies are legion! \u2014 but look at how he\u2019s pushed around. Trump takes a\n textbook oxymoron and gives it presidential form. Behold, at the Resolute Desk,\n a jumbo shrimp. \u201cThis goes all the way back to his childhood,\u201d Michael \nD\u2019Antonio, the author of \u201cThe Truth About Trump,\u201d told me. D\u2019Antonio said that \nat the military-themed boarding school that Trump attended, he was known for \ncomplaining to superiors about unfair treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s a strategy for him. He \nbelieves and has said that whining is a way to get what you want.\u201d Timothy \nO\u2019Brien, who wrote the Trump biography \u201cTrumpNation,\u201d recalled that in the \n1980s, when Trump failed to get the support that he wanted from Mayor Ed Koch \nfor an enormous development in Manhattan, he threw himself a pity party, railing\n that \u201cthe system and local government were conspiring against him.\u201d Trump \nsimilarly fashioned himself as a beleaguered hero battling dark forces when he \nbought into the fledgling United States Football League and sought to make it \ncompetitive with the National Football League. Goaded by Trump, the U.S.F.L. \nfiled an antitrust suit against the N.F.L. The suit was a bust; the N.F.L. was \nordered to pay $3 in damages. But that didn\u2019t throw him off his game, which he \nupsized for his presidential campaign. As the conservative columnist Rich Lowry \nnoted in August 2015: \u201cBy Trump\u2019s own account, he\u2019s the baddest, smartest thing \ngoing, except if you ask him a challenging question, in which case he kicks and \nscreams and demands to know how anyone could treat him so unfairly.\u201d Lowry \ncrowned Trump \u201cthe most fabulous whiner in all of American politics.\u201d The CNN \nanchor Chris Cuomo subsequently asked Trump about Lowry\u2019s words. \u201cI am the most \nfabulous whiner,\u201d Trump conceded. \u201cI keep whining and whining until I win.\u201d He \nwhined operatically as November 2016 approached and it seemed that he\u2019d lose to \nHillary Clinton. \u201cThe election is going to be rigged,\u201d he pouted, ever the \nvictim. Then he beat Clinton \u2014 and still whined, insisting without proof that \nshe\u2019d done better in the popular vote because of millions of illegal ballots. \nWoe is he, the object of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d regarding Russian assistance to his \ncampaign, the butt of a \u201choax\u201d about improper pressure on Ukraine, the commander\n in chief of armed forces that the whole world takes advantage of. In a key \npassage of the new book \u201cA Very Stable Genius,\u201d by the Washington Post reporters\n Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, Trump rants at top military brass about what \nhe perceives as America\u2019s exploitation by South Korea and by NATO allies, \nbarking, \u201cYou\u2019re a bunch of dopes and babies.\u201d It\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s also part \nof his political genius. He has turned himself into a symbol of Americans\u2019 \nvictimization, telling frustrated voters who crave easy answers that they\u2019re \nbeing pushed around by foreigners and duped by the condescending custodians of a\n dysfunctional system. He\u2019s their proxy, suffering on their behalf, and in that \nway he collapses the distance between a billionaire with multiple golf resorts \nand displaced factory workers struggling to hold on to their one and only homes.\n But while it\u2019s a fact that they\u2019ve been dealt a bad hand, it\u2019s a farce that he \nhas. His fortune began with money from Dad. He has stiffed creditors, evaded \ntaxes, attached his name to a bogus diploma mill, skimmed money from a \nfraudulent philanthropy, run afoul of campaign finance laws, signaled \nreceptiveness to Russian interference in the 2016 election and tried to obstruct\n the investigation of that \u2014 all without any commensurate punishment. Thanks to \nRepublicans in the Senate, he\u2019s poised to evade punishment again. We should all \nbe such victims.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by How to Convince a White Realtor You\u2019re Middle Class \nBlack people expend daily energy to counteract racial stereotypes and get fair \ntreatment. By Karyn Lacy Dr. Lacy is a professor of sociology. When the front \ndesk clerk at a Portland, Ore., hotel told Felicia Gonzales, a black woman, that\n guests were required to sign a two-page \u201cno party\u201d agreement in order to check \nin, she thought the request was so strange that she decided to sit in the lobby \nto see if white guests were asked to do the same. They weren\u2019t. Ms. Gonzales \nfiled a lawsuit last month, saying in the complaint that she had a \u201csense of \nincreased vulnerability, and feelings of racial stigmatization\u201d as a result of \nthe hotel\u2019s actions. The public learned about Ms. Gonzales\u2019s experience because \nnews sites reported on the suit. But often the exclusion of black people from \nparticipating in society on equal footing happens quietly. I study race and race\n relations for a living, and I\u2019ve long known that strategizing about ways to \navoid or counteract discrimination is an energy-draining task, and for too many,\n it\u2019s part of everyday life. When I talked two decades ago with more than 50 \nmiddle-class blacks who lived in the suburbs of Washington, I learned that their\n awareness of racial stereotypes led them to take on what I call \u201cpublic \nidentities\u201d \u2014 meaning they would strategically deploy cultural capital, \nincluding language, mannerisms, clothing and credentials in ways that brought \ntheir middle-class status firmly into focus. From their experiences attending \nintegrated high schools, many of these people had come to believe this was key \nto managing racism in interactions with white people. They hoped it would tip \nthe balance of their public interactions so that class would trump race and \npersuade white people to treat them fairly. This is an idea related to \u201ccode \nswitching,\u201d a term used to describe the temporary shift from black English to \nstandard English that some black people use to signal their appropriation of \nwhite, middle-class norms. But the public identities of the middle-class black \npeople I studied involved more than language: They spanned everything from dress\n to conversation topics to the small details of workplace conduct. As one of my \nsubjects, Charlotte, put it, black people \u201chave two faces. So you know how to \npresent yourself in the white world and you present yourself in the black world \nas yourself.\u201d There\u2019s good reason to believe that the public-identity behaviors \nI identified are as central a part of black middle-class life as ever. In a 2019\n survey by the Pew Research Center, black respondents were more likely than any \nother racial group to report that they felt people were suspicious of them (65 \npercent), that people acted as though they were not smart (60 percent), that \nthey were treated unfairly in hiring, pay or promotion (49 percent) and that \nthey had been unfairly stopped by the police (44 percent). In my research, \nseveral subjects told me that because of their awareness of the associations \nmany make between black people and poverty, when they went shopping, they \ndeliberately wore clothing that they hoped would convince white store clerks \nthat they were not poor. To avoid being treated as potential shoplifters, they \ntold me they would eschew attire that was at the time associated in the popular \nimagination with black culture \u2014 like oversize gold earrings, baggy jeans and \ndesigner tennis shoes. One subject, Philip, told me that he would go as far as \nto wear a suit. His belief was that when he was dressed as a professional, \nwhites saw his class status first and responded to him as a member of that \nsocial group. Once he began to make purchases, he hoped that additional \nsignifiers such as the kind of credit cards he carried and his ZIP code would \nassure store clerks that he was a member of the middle class. Another subject, \nJared, had a similar theory. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out in the world, you can be wearing \ngrubbies, and you\u2019ll be perceived a certain way if you\u2019re black,\u201d he said. He \ntold me he imagined white people operated under a different public dress code: \n\u201cIf you have money, it\u2019s O.K. to wear rags.\u201d Michael, a corporate manager, \nreported that he asserted his class status at work by refusing to answer his own\n telephone, always allowing calls to go through to his receptionist. He believed\n that taking on administrative tasks would reduce his social status in the \nworkplace to that of a subordinate and leave room for his colleagues to see his \nrace before his class and treat him with less respect. The people I spoke to \nsaid they paid a price when they failed to perform these public identities. \nOnce, dressed in sweatpants and a baseball cap, one of my subjects, Lydia, \ndecided to view a model home. Right away, the real estate agent asked if the \nhouse was in her price range. Lydia knew that preapproval was not required for a\n tour and suspected that, because of her casual clothing combined with her race,\n the agent had mistaken her for a poor person who couldn\u2019t realistically make an\n offer. After learning the asking price, which was in her range, Lydia took \ncharge of the interaction, putting on a public identity in the form of \ndemonstrating assertiveness and knowledge of the market. \u201cBasically, I told her \nI\u2019ll take a look at the house and I\u2019ll let her know when I\u2019m finished,\u201d she \nexplained. And she did. Lydia\u2019s experience echoed those of other house-hunting \nmiddle-class blacks who told me that they relied on firm language and knowledge \nof the market to manage interactions with white realty agents, hopeful that if \nthey conveyed that they were informed and authoritative, they would be seen as \nmembers of the middle class and treated with respect. Lydia wanted a home with a\n fireplace and she got it. However, she and other middle-class blacks I spoke to\n had no way to systematically assess how their housing searches compared with \nthose of their white counterparts. While these interviews took place some time \nago, and much has changed in the country since, black people have just as much \nreason to worry today. Decennial audit studies conducted by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, as well as an investigation conducted on Long \nIsland and published by Newsday in 2019 (in which black and white trained \ntesters using comparable financial identities visited the same real estate \noffices) have uncovered overwhelming evidence of housing discrimination against \nblacks, decades after the Fair Housing Act of 1968 made the practice illegal. \nThe people I talked to tended to focus more on their success in managing public \ninteractions than they did on what these efforts cost them in time, energy and \nemotions. But engaging public identities exacts a psychological toll, as one \nstudy participant hinted when she described \u201ca relaxed day\u201d at work for her as \none during which she didn\u2019t have to care what white people thought. And it\u2019s \nworth mentioning that while my research focuses on middle-class black people, \nthere\u2019s no doubt that black people of lower socioeconomic status who can\u2019t tap \ninto these public identities have daily encounters that are even more unfair and\n demoralizing. The humiliation that Ms. Gonzales says she endured at the hotel \nand that many endure every day cannot be resolved by anti-discrimination \nlegislation alone. Racism and stereotypes persist alongside the desire of black \npeople to be treated as well as whites \u2014 so the exhausting work of performing \npublic identities will persist, too.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Trump Tried to Dirty the Biden Name. He May Still Get\n His Chance.  Senate Republicans should not push for the political hit job that \neven a vulnerable foreign government refused to provide. By Joshua A. Geltzer \nMr. Geltzer is a law professor at Georgetown. Senate Republicans are threatening\n to give President Trump what even a foreign government knew was inappropriate: \nthe dirtying of a political rival. What an irony it would be if Mr. Trump\u2019s \nimpeachment trial itself yielded the very result for which he is being \nimpeached: the corruption of America\u2019s election integrity by the baseless \ndenigration of Mr. Trump\u2019s leading rival. It\u2019s a step Senate Republicans are \nwrong to push \u2014 and one Senate Democrats should consider very carefully before \npermitting as part of any deal for witnesses. The Ukraine extortion scandal was \nintended to sully Joe Biden, Mr. Trump\u2019s leading political rival, ahead of the \n2020 election. To achieve this, the first objective was to get Ukraine to \nannounce an investigation into Hunter Biden. The infatuation with the \nannouncement itself, rather than any actual investigation, shows clearly that \nMr. Trump was interested only in dirtying the Biden name before a potential \nelection face-off. It\u2019s astonishing that, despite Ukraine\u2019s intense dependence \non the United States for military, diplomatic and other support in the face of \nan existential threat from Russia and outright war on its soil, the country\u2019s \nleadership by and large resisted the campaign Mr. Trump relentlessly demanded \nand Rudy Giuliani, Gordan Sondland and others doggedly carried out. Ukraine \nnever actually announced an investigation that used the magic words \u201cBiden\u201d or \n\u201cBurisma,\u201d the name of the Ukrainian energy company on whose board Hunter Biden \nsat. Even a dependent and vulnerable foreign government seemed to understand the\n sheer impropriety of what Mr. Trump was doing; and, whether because of inherent\n misgivings or a sense that bending to Mr. Trump\u2019s will would risk Ukraine\u2019s \nreputation in the United States Congress and its standing with future \npresidents, Ukrainian leadership wouldn\u2019t give Mr. Trump what he demanded. How \nextraordinary, then, that some Republican Senators are now pushing to deliver \nprecisely what Ukraine refused to provide. As Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment trial \nbegins, Republicans like Rand Paul have insisted that, if any witnesses testify,\n those witnesses include Hunter Biden. Mr. Trump himself has gone further, \ndemanding that Hunter and Joe Biden testify. But to have any Biden testify would\n give Mr. Trump exactly what he sought from Ukraine. After all, neither Biden is\n actually a relevant witness: neither has insight into whether Mr. Trump \ncommitted the impeachable offenses of which he stands accused. That type of \nrelevant witness \u2014 which would include John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney \u2014 is \nprecisely the type that the president and Senate allies like Mr. Paul and Mitch \nMcConnell, the majority leader, are resisting. The Bidens, by contrast, know \nnothing and therefore have nothing to say about what Mr. Trump ordered, why he \ndid it, or whether it constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor such that the \npresident\u2019s removal from office is constitutionally justified. They are, in \nshort, irrelevant witnesses. But if a Biden is a witness, his actual testimony \nwould not matter because Mr. Trump, loudly echoed by his political and media \nallies, would endlessly insist that the Biden family\u2019s impropriety had been \nproven beyond any doubt by needing to testify before the Senate about its \npurported misdeeds. Fox News would roll endless clips of the questions Senate \nRepublicans would ask of either Biden while keeping the cameras on the witness, \nthen cutting away before showing the answers. This would be enough \u2014 more than \nenough \u2014 to lead many Americans to believe that Joe Biden indeed had done \nsomething wrong, even if they couldn\u2019t say exactly what it was. That would be a \ndangerous infection of America\u2019s 2020 election and an even more damaging step \nfor American democracy over the long haul. In 2016, election interference began \nwith Russian disinformation and continued with America\u2019s amplifying it. In 2020,\n we\u2019re already seeing election interference that begins with American \ndisinformation and then continues with Russian social media accounts amplifying \nit. Testimony from either Biden would bring that disturbing trend onto the \nhallowed floor of the Senate. Let\u2019s be clear: Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team is already \ndeploying that tactic; it submitted to the Senate this week a lengthy trial \nmemorandum that repeatedly perpetuates the notion that both Bidens were the ones\n who really did something wrong \u2014 not Mr. Trump. And it\u2019s a tactic Mr. Trump\u2019s \nSenate allies could, under the trial rules announced this week by Mr. McConnell \nthat delay the question of whether to call witnesses, deploy strategically only \nafter assessing how the trial\u2019s opening portions have gone for Mr. Trump. \nUltimately, this would reward Mr. Trump\u2019s impropriety with the very goal he has \nsought all along. He began this whole Ukraine saga by trying \u2014 baselessly and by\n abusing his public office \u2014 to dirty the Biden name. Thanks to the courage of a\n whistle-blower, the honest testimony of dedicated public servants and the vote \nof the House of Representatives, Mr. Trump stands impeached for this perversion \nof American democracy. For the next stage of the impeachment process to deliver \ninto Mr. Trump\u2019s lap the very goal that animated this entire effort in the first\n place would be a tragedy. Whatever they think of Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct, Senate \nRepublicans should not push for the corruption of our democracy that even a \nforeign government refused to provide. And Democrats should resist any such push\n \u2014 thinking very hard, in particular, before trading Mr. Biden\u2019s testimony for, \nsay, the testimony of Mr. Bolton or Mr. Mulvaney. There\u2019s no equivalence between\n a relevant witness and an irrelevant one. And it would be a high price to pay \nto fulfill Mr. Trump\u2019s very goal that got him impeached in the first place. \nJoshua A.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Baseball\u2019s Existential Crisis The Astros cheating \nscandal calls into question the fundamental values of the game. By Doug \nGlanville Mr. Glanville is a former Major League Baseball player and a \ncontributing opinion writer. We all search for relevance. To a baseball player, \nit often begins in a dream. My dream was brought to life in any game against my \nbig brother in Wiffle ball. The bases were always loaded, there were always two \nouts and the big game was forever on the line. It was about more than just being\n the hero. It was about reaching the pinnacle of the sport. In baseball, that \npinnacle is the World Series. And it is not just a matter of getting there. You \nneed to win it. What are you willing to do to be relevant? Last week, thanks to \na Major League Baseball investigation, we learned how the Houston Astros \nmanipulated cameras to steal their opponents\u2019 signs during their World Series-\nwinning 2017 season \u2014 a direct violation of Major League Baseball rules around \ntechnology-assisted game play. The Astros, who lost 100 or more games for three \nstraight years in the early part of the 2010s, had marched methodically to a \ndominant 2017, 101-win season built on patience, draft picks and raw \ndevelopment. Led by their general manager, Jeff Luhnow, who gained a reputation \nof innovative brilliance with a willingness to dig under every rock to find \nvalue and talent, and the charismatic and tactical field manager, A.J. Hinch, \nthey were poised to be a new kind of dynasty. But on that 2017 team, they had a \nplayer whose sensibilities were offended by what he saw from his team. In 2019, \nMike Fiers, at this point playing for a different organization, dropped the \nproverbial bomb on the baseball world while the Astros were seeking their second\n championship in three years. He was the first player to publicly accuse the \nAstros of using cameras to steal signs from their opponents, alleging that the \nteam had perfected ways to relay those signs to their hitters in real time. \nSigns are a team\u2019s communication system. The pitcher and catcher use them to \ncall pitches. One finger is a fastball, two is a curveball, and so on. If the \nopponent knows what is coming, a hitter moves much closer to being that dominant\n high school player from everyone\u2019s past who was almost impossible to get out. \nDoubt is erased, the element of surprise removed. Advanced information of this \nkind during a game is a huge advantage. True, there is a semi-analog version of \nsign-stealing that is above board. You can study a pitcher or a catcher and \nrecognize patterns. Patterns that tell you what the pitcher is about to throw, \npatterns that let you know the catcher is setting up for a curveball. You can \neven confirm this information by watching video after the game to help you for \nthe next time. If your opponent does not make adjustments, shame on him. But the\n Astros went beyond the insights of perceptive players. They relentlessly \nemployed in-game feeds, secret monitors and the video room, which is supposed to\n be for replay only. Then they formulated a relay scheme by using trash cans to \nencode sounds to pass encrypted information to their teammates on the field. \nFiers, as a pitcher, must have been even more offended, given these schemes \nalmost always benefit hitters. After results of the investigation were released,\n the league swiftly issued unprecedented punishments. It knocked over the \nAstros\u2019 building blocks \u2014 stripping away their first- and second-round draft \npicks for two years. It emptied their pocket change \u2014 a $5 million fine for the \norganization. And it suspended Luhnow and Hinch, their general manager and \nmanager, for a year. Then the Astros\u2019 owner went a step further and fired them \nboth immediately. But the consequences did not stop there. The Astros scandal \nalso led the Red Sox to \u201cpart ways\u201d with their manager, Alex Cora, winner of the\n 2018 World Series, who had been the Astros\u2019 bench coach in 2017 and whose name \nwas all over the report; Major League Baseball has opened an investigation into \nwhether Cora and others used similar subterfuge with the Red Sox. Carlos \nBeltran, who played for the 2017 Astros and had just been hired as the manager \nof the Mets, was also let go. The scandal is bigger than just personnel changes.\n Both the 2017 and 2018 World Series titles are now dubious achievements, \nbecause the report concluded that the Astros did in fact use technology \nillegally to steal the signs of their opponents. Given Cora appears to be a \ncommon denominator, our perception of the Red Sox\u2019s recent championship also \nhinges on the conclusion of this investigation. Back to back sullied \nchampionships would be a lot for baseball to absorb. My dreams of reaching that \npinnacle didn\u2019t end when I got to the major leagues. When I put on the uniform \nof the Phillies, the Cubs or the Rangers, it got more intense, even though \nwinning the World Series was less a dream but now a real possibility. Winning a \nring would make my career complete. That dream, which drives every professional \nplayer, loses meaning when champions cut corners. Fans doubt the sport\u2019s \nlegitimacy, which clouds subsequent titles and brings into questions previous \nones as well. The shiny trophy that my favorite Phillies team won in 1980 when I\n was 10 years old comes into question. Not because they were responsible for \nbehavior in 2017, but because those who later took the torch decided to forge it\n with fool\u2019s gold. That selfish act makes everyone question the validity of the \nfuture and the truth of the past. Players grow angry and dispirited to learn \nthat a team beat them for reasons unrelated to talent, hard work, or even a \nlucky bounce of the ball. We already know that the differences between major \nleague players are razor thin. Small enhancements lead to big advantages in the \nrealm of the elite. When the game is in doubt from every direction, baseball \nsuddenly faces an existential crisis. There are so many opportunities to cheat; \nwe all know it. Those who chose to play straight and respect the effort to \nmaintain fair play, whether player or organization \u2014 and the actions taken to \nrespond to the subversion of fair play \u2014 are what gives the game its moral \nclarity. Of course mistakes have always been made, both accidental and \nintentional, and the past isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 performance-enhancing drugs, gambling,\n the list goes on. But cheating has ultimately been framed and isolated as the \noutlier, carried out by bad actors. Scandals like this one, involving entire \norganizations, sadly make us all wonder whether the good actors are the \noutliers. Yet I doubt that the Astros were alone. Given the stakes, the hyper-\ncompetitive environment and the rapid escalation of the use of technology, it \nwould be na\u00efve to assume that ethical lapses would occur in isolation. Ones that\n can be conveniently framed as pushing the envelope. Sometimes these innovations\n are completely in bounds: shifting defenses, cut fastballs, openers, instant \nreplay. But they will also blur the line between innovation and anarchy, the \ndifference between being a step ahead of an opponent and stealing fairness from \nthe arena. Teams and players cross the line, and at times their only plan is to \nhope those lines get redrawn to justify their misdeeds; maybe the Astros\u2019 \nleaders hoped that tech-enhanced sign stealing would be normalized before it was\n outed. The cost can be steep when team obsession obscures the importance of the\n means of realizing that dream. When it is bought and stolen, hacked and spied \nupon, the trophy loses its shine, hopefully reminding us that at this level, \nthere is only a blurry sliver of daylight between fair competition and unfair \nadvantage. Yet that\u2019s precisely why baseball needs rules that are deliberate in \nslowing down or at least aligning with the tidal wave of technology. The rules \nthat the Astros violated were written precisely because, as in every other \naspect of our lives, technology is taking over. Calling signs with fingers when \nthere are hundreds of cameras trained on you seems archaic. Yet it is \ntraditional, and the collision of technology and tradition needs a bridge if we \nwant to preserve aspects of the past that are the signature of the game\u2019s \nheartbeat. The real consequence of the Astros scandal may be to stoke the \nfeeling of helplessness we all feel with technology at times, always a step \nbehind, dismissive of the finger-wagging dinosaur who is lecturing about the \npast, arrogantly pushing in the new era. Maybe the values behind the rules, the \n\u201clove of the game,\u201d are na\u00efve. That it is idealistic to dream of a World Series \nring won through pure team and individual effort; maybe we should have realized \nthe temptation of cutting corners for spoils that can more easily be acquired \nwith money, drugs and better technology. A rocket arm, a quick bat, a big heart,\n a blessing from divine sources or humility are diminished in such a world. What\n you came with is not enough naturally. If we do not respond by fighting for \nwhat we claim to value in fair play, such a scandal makes us beholden to the \nnotion that the prerequisites of success are simply deeper pockets, a better \npharmacist and a unethical hacker. And in such a world, humanity is marginalized\n and no game remains. Just video. So maybe the top isn\u2019t that shiny simply \nbecause it is the top. Maybe the top is just resting high on an ice cream cake, \ndoomed to melt from the heat of \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d ethics. Still, it has to \nbe about more than the bling. It has to matter how you get there, how you \nrespected the road that was paved before you arrived and how you lay down a \nfoundation for a future game. The pinnacle is meant to be a temporary space \nbecause of the spirit of competition and the revolving door of time, but it only\n is human when you prioritize the importance of ensuring that the game\u2019s \ngreatest achievements can only be acquired through fair play. The Astros scandal\n makes me revisit my entire baseball life. Reconsider my career and redefine \nsuccess. My major league trophy case is barren, true. I cannot claim all-star \nappearances, nor M.V.P. nods. I cannot claim stolen base titles or Gold Glove \nawards. My wedding ring is the only one on my finger. And there are many players\n who can claim only what I claim. Yet in moments like these, I hope we all \nrecognize that the case full of trophies, brimming with records broken, blinding\n us with statistical opulence, may sometimes be the one that is actually empty. \nDoug Glanville (@dougglanville), a former Major League Baseball player, is the \nauthor of \u201cThe Game From Where I Stand,\u201d a lecturer at the University of \nConnecticut and a contributing opinion writer.

We just have \nto make sure not to help them along. By Rivka Weinberg Ms. Weinberg is a \nphilosophy professor. Today, even as the 75th anniversary of the liberation of \nAuschwitz, on Jan. 27, approaches, our news feeds are teeming with more and more\n reports of hate crimes and extreme ideologies. I am alive because my paternal \ngrandfather\u2019s Spidey sense had him frantically looking for ways out of Germany \nin 1933. \u201cWhen madmen are elected, it\u2019s time to leave the country,\u201d he said. Now\n I, and many others I\u2019m sure, worry that a catastrophe is looming, and wonder \nhow we can guard against it. Schoolchildren are now taught: \u201cBe an upstander, \nnot a bystander!\u201d History, we\u2019re told, shows that, as Edmund Burke supposedly \nsaid, \u201cThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do \nnothing.\u201d Or in the words of historian Ian Kershaw, \u201cThe road to Auschwitz was \nbuilt by hate but paved with indifference.\u201d These aphorisms pithily conjure up \nimages of wise men stroking their long white beards, but they\u2019re wrong. How \nAtrocities Happen The road to Auschwitz was built by hate but it wasn\u2019t paved \nwith indifference. It was paved with collaboration. Anti-Semitism was entrenched\n in Europe for centuries before the Holocaust, supplying the Nazis with many \ncollaborators. During the Holocaust, the local population, the police and the \narmy often helped the Nazis. Not always, of course. There were resisters \n(heroes) and bystanders (ordinary people). But one thing is clear: During the \nHolocaust, where the local population was more anti-Semitic, they tended toward \ngreater collaboration, resulting in a markedly higher murder rate. To kill \npeople living within a population, you have to be told who and where they are. \nYou don\u2019t just march into Poland or France from Germany and magically know who \nto round up and where they live. It\u2019s even more helpful when the local police do\n the rounding up for you (as some did in Lithuania, France and Hungary). The \ncorrelation between local enthusiasm and the genocidal murder rate of the \nHolocaust is strong and stark, as Raul Hilberg and Hannah Arendt documented. In \nBulgaria and Italy, where the culture wasn\u2019t as anti-Semitic, the local \npopulations didn\u2019t cooperate with the murder of Jews; most Bulgarian and Italian\n Jews survived. Romania and Ukraine, on the other hand, had virulently anti-\nSemitic cultures and many Romanians and Ukrainians actively participated in \nmurdering Jews. Few survived. Poland was also very anti-Semitic, and although \nthere were Poles who sheltered Jews, many instead turned them in and looted \ntheir property. Some murdered Jews themselves. Very few Polish Jews survived. \nThe truth about how massive moral crimes occur is both unsettling and \ncomforting. It\u2019s unsettling to accept how many people participated in appalling \nmoral crimes but comforting to realize that we don\u2019t have to be heroes to avoid \ngenocides. We just have to make sure not to help them along. Upstander vs. \nBystander Realities Upstander ideology directs us to \u201cstand up\u201d to bullies and \nhate. Upstanding can be effective and inspiring, but it\u2019s dangerous. People who \nintervene to rescue victims or stop a crime often die in the attempt. It\u2019s hard \nto be a hero, to risk your safety and personal commitments in order to help a \nstranger. That\u2019s a big ask. And by asking people too much, we make being moral \ntoo hard \u2014 which, paradoxically, can make immorality too easy. \u201cClearly, being \nmoral is too hard, I\u2019m no hero! Forget it!\u201d we can imagine people thinking. The \nincorrect lesson upstander ideology draws from history ignores the fact that \nperpetrating vast crimes usually requires lots of help. Instead, it implicitly \nblames moral catastrophes on a failure of heroism. Yet heroism is exceptional, \nsaintly; that\u2019s not who most of us are, nor who most of us can be, so we\u2019re kind\n of off the hook. Most of us are ordinary people, neither cruel nor heroic. The \nfact is that when people can help others avert disaster at negligible cost to \nthemselves, most do. That is, unless they\u2019re steeped in hate \u2014 in which case \nbeing a bystander is a step up from the role of perpetrator they\u2019ve been primed \nfor. Bystanding is not the problem. What we need to guard against is hate and \ncollaboration with hate. It\u2019s rare for people not motivated by hate to casually \nwitness a serious crime and do nothing about it. (The notorious case of Kitty \nGenovese, the woman stabbed to death in 1964 in her apartment building \nvestibule, while supposedly dozens of people within earshot of her screams did \nnothing, is a case of false reporting.) Of course, we want to encourage \nresistance to injustice. That\u2019s an important part of being human, and when doing\n so doesn\u2019t entail outsized risks, we should do our part. But when helping \nothers is perilous, to help nonetheless is heroic. It\u2019s great to be a hero \u2014 and\n encouraging greatness has its place \u2014 but it\u2019s also important to be realistic \nand give moral guidance to ordinary people. People of average moral fortitude, \nif history is our guide, should be educated against collaboration with hate and \ntaught the reality of how widespread, repugnant and powerful that is. Heroism is\n aspirational, and worthy of admiration, but it is a pedagogical, moral and \nhistorical error to spend our moral capital insisting on it. When helping others\n is risky, the heroes who step forward don\u2019t do so because of effective \n\u201cupstander\u201d education. Research shows that heroic acts are usually done \ninstinctively, without much thought at all. So to whatever extent we want to \nencourage heroism, moral upstanding training seems unlikely to help. Heroism is \nnot morally obligatory, not teachable and not what we must demand of citizens in\n order to avoid catastrophic crimes against humanity. What we must emphasize is \nthe cruelty and destructiveness of hate and the perils of collaborating with it.\n The Lessons of History Some people unwittingly help atrocities occur by \ncooperating in an attempt to mitigate a monstrous situation. History \ndemonstrates that this is nearly always a miscalculation. During the Holocaust, \nJewish councils organized life in the ghetto and compiled lists of Jews for \ndeportation, often thinking that they were helping Jews manage a nightmare. \nUltimately, they helped the Nazis murder Jews by maintaining order and providing\n the Gestapo with the names of people to be deported and murdered. In his \nmemoir, \u201cLegislating the Holocaust,\u201d Bernhard L\u00f6sener, a lawyer in the Third \nReich\u2019s Ministry of the Interior, relays how he hurriedly traveled through the \nnight to get to Nuremberg in time to write the Nuremberg race laws so that the \nrule of law would be preserved, and how he fought to have the race laws written \nto count as Jewish those with three Jewish grandparents rather than those with \none drop of Jewish blood. He too made the mistake of participating in the \natrocity in an attempt to minimize the damages caused by its perpetrators. \nL\u00f6sener remains the lawyer who wrote the Nuremberg race laws, lending a veneer \nof legality to a crime. Maybe someone else would have ignored the rule of law or\n written more draconian laws if he hadn\u2019t, but maybe not. What we can decide is \nwhether we will be a participant in terrible things done by terrible people. It \nnever works to participate in the terrible thing in order to try to make it less\n bad. It\u2019s tempting, and can seem like the right thing to do: L\u00f6sener\u2019s race \nlaws included fewer people than a one-drop rule would (though that had \nnegligible effect). Adolf Eichmann reasoned similarly: \u201cIf this thing had to be \ndone at all, it was better that it be done in good order.\u201d History shows that \nwhen you participate in an atrocity together with the perpetrators, in an \nattempt to make it somehow a little less horrible, in the end you\u2019re still \nparticipating in the atrocity \u2014 and it is no less horrible. Morality and My \nMother Like so many other things about me, my perspective on bystanders \nhorrifies my mother. She is appalled that I could think we aren\u2019t morally \nobligated to rescue each other, even at great personal sacrifice. To her, the \nobligation is obvious. \u201cDo not stand idly by the blood of your neighbor!\u201d she \nexclaims, channeling Leviticus. Heroic acts of upstanding have shaped my \nmother\u2019s life. She is alive because of someone\u2019s heroism, and she lost her job, \nprematurely ending a treasured career, because of her own. My mother was saved \nfrom the Holocaust by Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul who ignored orders \nand issued several thousand transit visas to Lithuanian Jews, allowing them to \nflee the advancing Gestapo. Many years later, when a colleague was unfairly \nfired, my mother organized senior employees to speak out against the injustice, \neven though she knew not only that she would be likely to lose her own job as a \nresult but also that she was unlikely to get another job at her age. She did \nlose her job, and did not get another one. The loss profoundly affected the \ntrajectory and quality of her life, but she still says she doesn\u2019t regret what \nshe did and would do it again. Listening to my mother, I feel somewhat ashamed. \nI think I feel the shame of the ordinary person in the face of those who are \nmorally greater than us; my mother is a much better person than I am. But I \ndoubt the average person can be as heroic. Luckily, that is not necessary to \navert moral catastrophe. The Takeaway The belief that atrocities happen when \npeople aren\u2019t educated against the evils of bystanding has become part of our \nculture and how we think we\u2019re learning from history. \u201cDon\u2019t be a bystander!\u201d \nwe\u2019re exhorted. \u201cBe an upstander!\u201d we teach our children. But that\u2019s all a big \nmistake. All of it: It\u2019s false that doing nothing creates moral catastrophes; \nit\u2019s false that people are generally indifferent to the plight of others; it\u2019s \nfalse that we can educate people into heroism; and it\u2019s false that if we fail to\n transmit these lessons another Holocaust is around the corner. Instead, the \nfacts are more quotidian: Terrible things happen when people collaborate with \nterrible perpetrators; most people are generally helpful to the extent that \ntheir circumstances and temperament allow (unless they\u2019ve been taught to hate); \nbeing a bystander is often morally permissible; being a hero is exceptional and \ninstinctual (not taught); and what history teaches us is both easier and harder \nthan the supposed dark dangers of bystanderdom. What history teaches us is: \nDon\u2019t perpetrate; don\u2019t collaborate. If you can be heroic, that is laudable. \nThose lessons are hard to learn, but effective and easy enough to follow to \navert most vast moral crimes. Next time the murderers come, it\u2019s understandable \nif it\u2019s too much to ask for us to risk our lives, our children, or even our \njobs, to save others. Just don\u2019t welcome the murderers, don\u2019t help them organize\n the oppression or make it \u201cless terrible\u201d (that won\u2019t work anyway), and don\u2019t \nturn people in.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by How to Defeat Trump and Catch a Frisbee There is a \nwinnable approach for Democrats in the impeachment trial. By Thomas L. Friedman \nOpinion Columnist As the country embarks on only the third impeachment trial of \na president in its history, there are many unique features about this moment, \nbut one stands out for me: Never before have we had to confront a president who \nlies as he breathes and is backed by a political party and an entire cable TV-\nled ecosystem able and enthusiastic to create an alternative cognitive universe \nthat propagates those lies on an unlimited scale. It is disheartening, \ndisorienting and debilitating. How can the truth \u2014 that Donald Trump used \ntaxpayer funds to try to force the president of Ukraine to sully the reputation \nof Joe Biden, a political rival \u2014 possibly break through this unique trifecta of\n a president without shame, backed by a party without spine, reinforced by a \nnetwork without integrity? There is only one way: Keep it simple. Democrats need\n to just keep repeating over and over one question: \u201cWhy would an innocent man, \nand a jury interested in the truth, not want all the evidence out and all the \nwitnesses to testify? Wouldn\u2019t you if you were innocent?\u201d Indeed, at moments \nlike these I always fall back on what I consider to be one of the most useful \nessays in political science. It was a 2012 speech by Andrew G. Haldane, a top \neconomist at the Bank of England, at an economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\n It was titled \u201cThe Dog and the Frisbee\u201d and was all about how central bankers \nand regulators should think about regulation after the 2008 financial crisis. \nHaldane began by asking a profound philosophical question that we should all \nponder occasionally: Why are dogs better than humans at catching a Frisbee? \n\u201cCatching a Frisbee is difficult,\u201d Haldane began. \u201cDoing so successfully \nrequires the catcher to weigh a complex array of physical and atmospheric \nfactors, among them wind speed and Frisbee rotation. Were a physicist to write \ndown Frisbee-catching as an optimal control problem, they would need to \nunderstand and apply Newton\u2019s Law of Gravity. Yet despite this complexity, \ncatching a Frisbee is remarkably common. \u2026 It is a task that an average dog can \nmaster. Indeed some, such as Border collies, are better at Frisbee-catching than\n humans. \u201cSo, what is the secret of the dog\u2019s success? The answer, as in many \nother areas of complex decision-making, is simple,\u201d he said. \u201cOr rather, it is \nto keep it simple. For studies have shown that the Frisbee-catching dog follows \nthe simplest of rules of thumb: Run at a speed so that the angle of gaze to the \nFrisbee remains roughly constant.\u201d Haldane then went on to explain that catching\n a financial crisis required the same approach: Keep it simple, don\u2019t choke \nmarkets with too many complex regulations, understand that oftentimes \u201cless may \nbe more.\u201d So it is with this impeachment, too. Democrats need to keep it simple.\n The goal in this trial is not a conviction by the Senate. That is simply \nimpossible with this Republican Party intimidated by this president using this \nFox News-led noise machine. The most that can be achieved, and it\u2019s a lot, \nactually, is to convey to the swing voters \u2014 the independents, suburban women \nand moderate Republicans who delivered the House to the Democrats in the 2018 \nmidterms \u2014 just how much this president is ready to put himself above the law. \nAnd, therefore, four more years of his presidency, when he would no longer be \n\u201crestrained\u201d by the need for re-election, would be catastrophic for our \ncountry\u2019s unity and for the institutions and norms that have sustained it since \n1776. I am convinced that more Americans are worried about the country\u2019s \ncohesion and its institutions being ripped apart by Trump than Trump realizes. \nIt\u2019s a key reason his approval rankings remain largely flat while our stock \nmarkets soar. I also believe that the Trump team has overestimated how easy it \nwill be for it to just keep hiding the most important evidence and witnesses now\n that the impeachment trial has begun and many Americans are tuning in to this \nissue for the first time. And when they do, variations of that simple question \u2014\n \u201cWhy would an innocent man, and a jury interested in the truth, not want all \nthe evidence out and all the witnesses to testify? Wouldn\u2019t you if you were \ninnocent?\u201d \u2014 will take on even more power. Republican senators have been able to\n dodge that question for months while the matter was in the House, but not any \nlonger. And you can already see how uncomfortable it makes them by the way \nSenator Martha McSally literally ran away from and denounced a CNN reporter when\n he asked her if the Senate should consider new evidence as part of the \nimpeachment trial. There is a reason McSally fled. A CNN poll released Monday \nnight found that 69 percent of Americans want the Senate to call new witnesses, \nwhile 26 percent do not. Democrats still need to come up with a compelling \ncandidate against Trump. But the midterms told us that there is an important \ncoalition of independents, moderate Republicans and suburban women no longer so \nsold on Trump. In 2016 they disliked Hillary Clinton and were willing to give \nTrump a chance, telling themselves, \u201cHow bad could it be \u2014 and hey, anyway, we \nhave the Constitution to protect us.\u201d Then they witnessed just how bad it could \nbe and that the Constitution in Trump\u2019s hands could not protect us. Democrats \nrunning in swing districts in 2018 also kept it simple, focusing on Trump\u2019s \nattempts to destroy Obamacare and coverage of pre-existing medical conditions. \nThis impeachment trial is another opportunity to show those swing voters just \nhow bad it could be, by constantly asking why an innocent president would be \nfrantically preventing the likes of his former national security adviser, John \nBolton; his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney; and his secretary of state, \nMike Pompeo, from testifying. That\u2019s banana republic stuff. That\u2019s end-of-\nseparation-of-powers stuff. That\u2019s I-am-above-the-law stuff. I repeat, it may \nnot change the outcome of this trial. But it will strike some average, fair-\nminded Americans as just not right and give them another justification \u2014 for \nthemselves, for their friends and for their families \u2014 to swing away from Trump \nin the presidential election. If the next election is about Trump, not the \nDemocrat, a lot of experts believe, he will have a real uphill climb. In order \nto prevent that, you are about to see the Trump-Fox-G.O.P. noise machine go \nnuclear, pull out all the stops and fill the airwaves and the internet with \ndistractions and misinformation. So keep cutting through it with that simple \nquestion: \u201cWhy would an innocent man not want all the evidence out and all the \nwitnesses to testify? Wouldn\u2019t you if you were innocent?\u201d Rinse and repeat. \nRinse and repeat. Don\u2019t make it complicated. Just catch the Frisbee.
