Now that the Iraq war is in the spotlight again,if Democrats Elect a Nominee like Biden,Who Voted For The Disastrous Iraq War that Cost millions of lives and Voted For The Job-killing Trade Deals That Cost millions of Jobs, then Trump Will Tear Into Biden And Eat His Lunch In General Election Just As He Did To Hillary Clinton And Jeb Bush In 2016. Bernie's The Best, He Voted Against Iraq War And All The Job-killing Trade Deals. This Primary Is A Rare Opportunity To Elect A Very Rare Honest Politician Called Bernie And He Will Surely Be Elected The President November 2020.",

Democrats need someone not only with good policies, but someone who can encourage voters to vote blue, to take back the House, Senate, and ultimately Supreme Court. That way legislation can actually get enacted. Pete Buttigieg is my #1 because of his ability to make pragmatic, very progressive policies appeal to everyone, increasing the chance they get enacted. And helping people all over the arbitrary spectrum support him. You read things about candidates, then you actually hear them speak. It's different. Despite some of the division online, I've listened to candidates speak and read their policies. Whoever the nominee is, they will make the country much better than the current administration. We are fortunate to have several good Democratic candidates this cycle, and while I think Pete would be the best for America's future, many have strong points and are contributing to our future just by running.",

            "comment_body": "All democratic candidates would be a vast improvement over the current president. However there are large differences in electability and coat tails between the candidates. Winning against an incumbent in a not-so-lousy economy is difficult. Only a candidate which can excite the base and at the same time attract many Obama/Trump voters can win. The first requirement is hard for Biden to fulfil, and the second is hard for Warren and Sanders. Pete Buttigieg has convincingly shown that he can do both. He is a pragmatic progressive that 'speaks Dem with a Republican accent'. For that reason his coat tails will be large. Not for nothing many Dems in purple districts have endorsed him, as these people would likely lose with a Warren or Sanders ticket. So Buttigieg is our best chance to win, and to help win House and Senate. It helps that his policies are generally most well thought out, and at the same time much cheaper than those proposed by Warren and Sanders. Buttigieg is best suited to create a large coalition bc he is not about 'us versus them'. He welcomes 'future former Republicans', but is not like Biden under the illusion that congressional Republicans will have good will towards Dems once Trump is gone. Finally, Buttigieg is young, i.e. his tech knowledge is current, unless that of the septaguenarians in the race.",

So, there is the dilemma - to exempt more things to help poor, but that will result in less revenue to fund the UBI. Without significant reform, UBI doesn't solve any problems. It is good to have some money when you unemployed, but 12k per year, it is not livable salary even in MO, not talking about about high-priced places as CA. If you short on paying your bills, it doesn't matter how much you shot by 300$ or by 1k. They cut your electricity in any case.",

They may not have started this way but the drive to be president is usually fueled by the thirst for power and prestige.\n\nWhen Americans say they do not want a politician, most are really saying they want someone who isn\u2019t in this for their own self-gain.\n\nThis is what makes Andrew Yang so different-the kind of anti-politician that Trump isn\u2019t. The one most Americans have actually been seeking. He doesn\u2019t hang his hat on ideas because they lean politically to the left or right, but because they can best solve systemic problems without creating new ones. There\u2019s an ingenuity to his ideas that weave their way through multiple ideologies simultaneously because they aren\u2019t about any to begin with.\n\nAfter looking through his array of policy proposals, perhaps his most important proposal is not the Freedom Dividend, but \u201cThe American Scorecard\u201d. Rather than measure the economy by metrics like GDP,  we should include ones that actually measure our progress as humans, like life expectancy. This way, corporations would be held accountable (and even incentivized) to improve these metrics, not simply the bottom line.\n\nUnfortunately, folks who have slipped into the spell of identity politics quickly confront a Yang policy as libertarian, socialist, right-leaning, left-leaning etc., often times within the very same policy! \n\nA Yang nomination would be the end of identify politics and perhaps the start of real unity in America.",

It\u2019s rare for me to truly trust a president to act on my behalf, so yes, I\u2019m excited about the possibility of having someone in the White House I believe in.",

Those believing that Biden will be their \"white knight\", are allowing their fear to cloud their judgment.\n\nWere this even 10 years ago, their rationale for choosing Joe might be well founded - although personally I would still object to him - but at this point, Biden's age, and the wear and stress he's undergone have visibly affected him. His once predictable \"gaffs\" have become even more numerous, and his inability to speak coherently is almost painful to watch. In short, Biden supporters are projecting the Joe of old, while denying what their own senses tell them.\n\nBeyond Biden, this fear that \"moderate\" won't support a more progressive candidate is overblown. Sure, some \"moderates\" will be turned off by Sanders and Warren's agendas, but if they actually refuse to vote for them against Trump, then their votes were never in play to begin with, and therefore, to give weight to these counterfeit Dems is a mistake. \n\nAnd consider: many who voted for Trump when polled said they would've voted for Sanders instead. While the MSM and his opponents call his platform \"radical\", man Americans don't think so. In 2016 MFA was \"crazy\", now every Democratic candidate talks about adopting some version of it.\n\nBeating Trump requires courage and passion, and the one candidate who generates the most of that is Sanders.",

The only candidate who has consistently spoken well of fellow contenders and remained issue-centered, as well as refusing donor contributions (thus been ineligible to participate in the debates), has been Michael Bloomberg. I have been listening more closely to his stands on the major issues, and while i may not agree on every specific, I feel confident he'd be able to call upon his experiences in the business and political realms to work on reasonable solutions that would benefit the country in the end. I wonder if some of our citizens forget that we do not need a leader who is perfect in every detail. We are at present, however, desperately in need of one who is willing to uphold the Constitution, and work with others, regardless of party affiliation, with faithful intention to do what is best for our country and its people. So far, Mr. Bloomberg seems to be the only one who answers questions asked of him on the issues while grasping that duty, and appearing fully prepared to meet it.",

Compare the costs of war vs. the cost of buying - literally buying - the allegiances of a but a handful of key representatives. A billion dollars goes a long way. Watching Graham, Nunez, and Jordan causes me to wonder what was the price. \nHoover denied the existence of organized crime and the Mafia thrived. That photo of J. Edgar in a tutu might have had something to do with it. And Lindsey is so photogenic. What was the price for him to change his mind and position to change from calling Trump a moron to his present condition of enthusiastic sycophant? What could Lev Parnes have done to get Kevin McCarthy to wrap his arms around him?  And is Mrs. McConnell doing well in the cabinet? For a reference point, take a look at the GOP in Indiana in 1923 and KKK Grand Dragon, David Stephenson. Murder, money, power and GOP politics. It's sought of a how-to script for Trump's GOP. Wikipedia has a good read on it. The basic rule for unearthing what's happening right now is to just follow the money. and it is all flowing from Moscow.",

In fact, come to think of it, removing him from office will be a feat in itself. I fully expect this sorry egomaniac to try and stay in the White House by any means possible. Expect to send a Marine Corps detail to accompany the Bekins moving truck when that time comes. The hatred will continue because this man knows nothing about humanity and empathy. All bluster and his minions love this. That's why the feel it's okay to hate.",

If a Republican senator facing reelection were to defy his party and let the evidence, favorable or incriminating, determine his vote in the impeachment trial, would such a display of integrity encourage Democratic voters to support him?  We know that a rebellion of this kind would alienate the Republican base.\n\nJames Madison  argued that the system created by the Constitution could not work in the absence of what he  called political virtue, but the checks and balances the framers built into that system relied on competing ambitions of officeholders to thwart tyranny.  The president and members of congress would protect their own institutional powers by deflecting attempts of the other to enhance the authority of the  competing branch.\n\nThis mechanism has generally worked well, but a system which encourages self-interested behavior seems poorly designed to serve as a nursery for profiles in courage.  A political system which requires officeholders to defy the incentives inherent in it, in order to act with integrity, must rely on a country's cultural values to instill virtue in its leaders.

They have adopted the ends justifies the means ethos of the Bolsheviks they once so vehemently opposed: any lie, any slander, any action however amoral is fine as long as it furthers the cause. And the cause is to establish a conservative autocracy where plutocrats run the world while the \"people\" are manipulated, pacified by drugs and media, and  exploited by  corporations while maintaining the illusion of democratic agency.

The paradigm arose that even talking about population growth was tantamount to racism.  Forget for now how this prevents any effective fight against global warming.\n\nThe trope that all political problems are at their foundation racism in one or another form has prevented Americans from having a rational discussion regarding illegal immigration.\n\nWe need such a discussion, which avoids the extreme in which immigrants suffer unnecessary hardship, while at the same time we prevent immigration from destroying the safety net for our own poor.\n\nWhy can liberals not countenance a discussion of numbers?  The fact that Guatemala's population has quadrupled since 1960?  That population growth makes the solution of poverty in the third world through immigration into the US untenable?  That resources are limited?\n\nWithout such a debate any successes of liberalism will be short-lived.

The culmination of that effort is the impeachment that has been delivered to the Senate. I hear Chief Justice Roberts is a smart, dignified man who cares deeply about our democratic institutions. Come Tuesday, he will be in a position to show if he is that man. When a Democratic Senator requests a subpoena for a key witness, Roberts can voice his assent to that request before Senator Mitch McConnell orders a floor vote. Showing where the Chief Justice stands on each and every requested subpoena will be an important stimulant for the morally-dormant Republican Senators before they vote on whether or not the witness should appear. If Chief Justice merely punts it to McConnell without comment, he will be guilty of \"doing nothing\" when he could have done something to make a real trial of it. It will be interesting to see how he presides. I hope he knows the moment because it feels like the last chance for the good guys.",

However, there is something rather unfair about it: America knowingly, intentionally elected a two-bit crook and then, when he acted in a crooked manner, we impeached him.\n\nThe Republicans intentionally voted in a criminal regime. They still actively and nearly-universally support this crime family administration, and they do so knowingly. This is the government they want, since by protecting it they can so easily keep power, divide the middle and lower classes against each other, and obtain riches (and share those riches with their benefactors).\n\nAre we an oligarchy? No, we're beyond that. We're the lowest form of bread-and circuses kleptocracy, and a state-sponsored criminal network. If you're a Republican, you are part of this criminal organization. You're a soldier in this fetid swamp of an administration, and you participate in full awareness of the evil. And, you put it in power essentially without concealment or misrepresentation.",

Trump has become an avatar who speaks for the oppressed, those who have no voice, at least in their minds. Yes, it had much to do with much of the country left behind by de-industrialization but even more so a profound sense of resentment and visceral hatred for elite, woke, entitled liberals with their political correctness. I\u2019m not suggesting that the enmity is well deserved, certainly not in its intensity, but the problem becomes much harder to solve when understood simply as evil especially when I\u2019m afraid that things are going to get far, far worse.",

Yet the media (including great reporters at the NYT, WA Post, NPR, etc) continues to report on Trump and the GOP as if they were a normal president & political party.  They are not.\n\nMainstream journalism's \"both sidesism\"--a norm that these journalists would wrongly call \"objectivity\"--means that they give equal coverage and legitimacy to \"both sides\", even when one \"side\" is knowingly communicating falsehoods.   The media generally gives credibility to the GOP by failing to clearly describe its leaders' assertions as false, or by conflating insignifcant & significant matters.\n\nTrump was, and is, a professional TV actor, a former \"celebrity\" who knew exactly how to manipulate the media into making him a celebrity.  It's his actual genius.\n\nOne part of that genius, and now the GOP's strategy, is to use the media's \"both sidesism\" to create \"false equivalencies\" between Trump and his opponents, and the GOP and the Democratic Party.  It was a successful way to demoralize potential Democratic voters in 2016, causing millions to stay home instead of voting--a sophisticated form of voter suppression.  With the media's continued help, it's likely to work again in 2020.  \n\nHe defined Hillary as \"corrupt\" by repeated lies about \"her emails\" & the Clinton Foundation.  The media  reported them, legitimizing the lies, & inflating their significance.  He'll successfully do the same with his next opponent with the help of the media's \"both sidesism\".

Rather, the election of Trump is merely the apotheosis of the constant stream of divisiveness, lies, and hatred that has been purposefully fomented and promulgated by the Right over the past few decades (starting with Newt Gingrich, Fox News, and Rush Limbaugh).\n\nSince then, contagion of silence spread insidiously throughout the Republican party.  During all those years, did ANY Republicans speak out against them?  No!  Rather, the Republican party gladly adopted the strategy of refusing to work with Dems in any manner whatsoever.  They refused to refute the lies of Birtherism.  They accepted the hatred of the Rightwing White Nationalists, because their hatred brought them more votes.\n\nMore importantly: Egan's putatively \"reasonable Conservative\" colleagues like David Brooks, Ross Douthat, and Bret Stephens sat in silence at the outrageous behaviors of their party.  Then suddenly they started wringing their hands when Trumpism exposed what they had allowed to happen.\n\nPeople like Brooks, Douthat, and Stephens are complicit in the evils of Trumpism.  People like Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Charles Grassley, Lisa Murkowsky, and all the rest of the Republicans are complicit in the evils of Trumpism.  They could have spoken out when there was a chance to prevent it; but they didn't.\n\nThey're all as guilty as the \"everyday\" Germans who allowed and abetted the rise of Hitler.",

US media misidentified government murder in El Salvador and Guatemala as resulting from a struggle between \"rightists and leftists,\" a convenient cop-out. Dead nuns and a bishop did not move the needle.

Somehow, even given recent experience, we believed that people who dressed correctly would never mislead us. Or maybe it's just easier to do nothing and claim ignorance. Like frogs in fairly warm water now, we enjoyed the climate change, unaware of what was coming next.\n\nLet's not pretend that Trump is a singularity. Doing so lets us off the hook for enabling a vulture party to shift America's priorities from addressing social needs to filling cronies' pockets with tax gold.

Anyone who has read a good deal of quality novels will have the right combination of discernment, ethics and human compassion to reject Trump and his cohorts.

Napoleon and Hitler were actively supported as long as they were winning, as was the Iraq war initially.  Sometimes dictators succeed because they bring economic stability out of chaos, as Putin apparently did.  Part of Trump's success is due to the racism and xenophobia of a part of the population.  To bring Trump down it may be necessary to identify the critical thing or things that a majority actually want and make a convincing case that they can be supplied.

And, the misdirection to those-who-don't-conform will become more and more strident.\n\nEconomic stratification is now greater than it was in 1929. Something is going to give.

Clearly, we cannot depend on Republicans to put a stop to Trump's intolerable behavior, which makes their own behavior equally so.\n\nThis need have become a partisan issue. For generations, even with its faults and sometimes defining historical injustices, America was governed by a salient code that looked askance at the sort of travesties now not only accepted, but encouraged and intentionally provoked. The proverbial shining city on a hill has become a tarnished, fetid swamp inhabited by night crawlers.\n\nOne can analogize this with the ascendancy of Naziism in Germany, when too many of its citizens looked the other way. One can ask why we decry totalitarianism in places like Saudi Arabia, North Korea, and China, railing also against Muslim extremism, while tolerating the ascendancy of overt hatred, indecency and religious extremism within our own borders.\n\nThe answer lies in fear, fear of differences, fear of one's neighbors, fear of angering an incumbent president, and fear of losing one's Senatorial sinecure while having to relinquish power. \n\nThe solution?

Go back in time to every decade in our past and there will be the forces of the reactionary right, feeding off the fears and narrowness of an uneducated and manipulated populace. What perhaps has changed is that a bottom feeder such as Trump has been allowed to scramble to the top of the podium. In previous years he would have been vetted out. But make no mistake, we have been here before. Pay Buchanan, Joe McCarthy, George Wallace, Huey Long - the list goes on and on. They may be gone, but the millions who followed them?

It is said to be a compulsive brain disorder where stimuli is rewarded despite adverse consequences (voting against ones own self interests or moral compass).  It functions through repeated exposures (Tweets and rallies).  The stimuli is felt to be positive, desirable, pleasurable and rewarding to the addicted person (it really isn't).\n\nI'll leave it to the medical and scientific communities to develop the appropriate term, diagnosis and cure for this newest addiction form.  Oops, forgot they have been gutted, under-funded and bludgeoned, called fake sciences by the currrent purveyor.\n\nSo it looks like it is up to the non-addicted to rescue those under its spell.

There was a reason Donald Trump was considered a sideshow & person not to be taken seriously in the 80s and 90s when he mused about running for president: Sensible & honorable people like Bush knew what Trump was about & there knew was no room for him in legitimate, serious politics & therefore didn\u2019t give him that room. Now, people like Reagan and Bush are gone and what\u2019s left are party leaders and elected office holders motivated solely by self-interest and self-preservation. Their self-preservation prevents them from doing the right thing and standing up to the craziness & corruption undertaken by Trump, his family, and their hangers-on on a daily basis.  These politicians and party leaders (from county councilmen on up to members of Congress) are paralyzed by fear by the Fox News constituents who vote in primaries.

There are three things I have heard which affirm to me that Trump is involved with manipulating the Ukranian government to aid his personal advancement\n\n\u00a0Don Jr.once said in his business life his father knew every little thing that happened. Nothing happened, the son said, that the older Trump did not have his fingers in. So when Lev Parnas or Gordon Sondland say that Trump knew what was going on, I believe them.\n\nMichel Cohen said in his testimony before Congress that Donald Trump talks in code.  I might guess he learned his lessons well from Roy Cohn and other perhaps shady people in the world of construction and real estate in places like New York City. So when Trump did not state anything directly in his Zelensky phone call it is not surprising.\u00a0\n\nIf Trump is good at anything it is the art of the con. He might call it deal making -- the difference between the two is subtle. As with all con artists Trump get people to do all the things he asks of them because he is very charismatic and charming.  He can draw people in. That Lev Parnas believed he was doing nothing wrong is not surprising. That Michael Cohen will do everything asked of him is not surprising.\n\n\u00a0I only hope that Trump's  past will catch up to him because he is really just a thug in a fancy suit surrounded by other thugs in fancy suits.

That's hardly an endorsement for continued employment. \n\nWith what appears to be a thin resume, Yovanovitch is emblematic of what many Trump supporters view as an entrenched, entitled and inept State Department corps with a legacy of failure in places like Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan...and Ukraine.

What's striking is that I haven't heard any of her defenders claim that Yovanovitch's dismissal has made Ukraine more corrupt. Indeed, there is evidence that it is less so.

So looking at an atlas you will find many details including Ukraine's proximity to Russia, and an eastern Ukrainian city very near the border with Russia, whose Mayor negotiated the possible construction of a Trump Tower in Moscow before the 2016 election. For what purpose if other than business? Or more germaine; what of the name Parnas? It kind of reminds me of Golf, how about you? At this point, It is possible Trump is a chump of the Russians. I will give him the benefit of the doubt besides his deplorable character which may be more because of the pressure he is under.\n\nYou must consider the possibility that Ukrainian President Zelensky, another Television actor, is a focus of Trump because he is young and trained to do what he is told as an actor, and that made him a prime candidate for manipulation, and of course, Yavonavitch would have caught on pretty quick and that likely made her a focus of Trump and Giuliani. I do believe Ukraine is a go between between the Trump people and Russia. After all, Didn't General Flynn sit at Putin's side for dinner and was his first National Security adviser? \n\nI can only hope the connections to Russia are to assure peace, but, why did Putin base military in Venezuela?

Birds of a feather, and all that.\n\nFinally, just to keep the list of reasons short, is Trump's propensity to always blame others when the tide turns against him. He never accepts personal responsibility for catastrophes of his own doing.\n\nThe stain on Trump's reputation is nothing new. What is new and used to be shocking is the number of Republican officials, from the top down, who have sacrificed any reputation they might once have had for personal integrity, in order to curry favor with Trump. \n\nThat leads me to wonder what he's got on them.

Those enablers are US Senators, US House representatives who have plugged their ear with each others fingers, and Trump voters. \n\nFacts in evidence strongly support the notion that Guiliani was choreographing the plan to get dirt on the Biden's, telling his henchmen ( Parnas and others) what was needed, expected and desired, and then  tasked them with getting it. In this instance, their activities were focused on getting Ukraine officials to acknowledge, announce, or merely give creedence to basically a debunked rumor...that the Biden's were involved in some form of corrupt activity. Trump, campaign associates,  surrogates and proxies  would then use this information to help defeat his opponent ( Biden)  in 2020.\n\nThe fact that Trump  spent so much time entertaining such claptrap shows his \"win at any cost\", \"ends justifies the means\" mentality.  But, Guiliani, acting on the behalf of his clinet, the POTUS,  was the architect,  master mind and  Svengali all rolled into one of the mechanics of this highly illegal and unethical process. At this point, turning a blind eye to this behavior further emboldens and enables Trump and his associates. As such, they are the \"silent majority of enablers\".",

But that paucity of character judgement goes back to his business relationships. He has his own rogues gallery of men with whom he has\u00a0 surrounded himself. His business dealings from his unsuccessful casinos to his \" University\" Trump's businesses were more likely to fail as succeed.  The list of his decisions as President that show his lack of judgement are  many . Governing via tweet should probably head the list. It is not that other presidents didn't have their own judgement issues or poor decisions on who they pick for their inner circle. It is Trump's lack of judgement on top of his total lack of understanding of the issues, his total lack of any knowledge of historical, geographical, social, religious, economic context for why we are where we are on top of his narcissistic point of view and his vile temper and his impulsivity makes him very, very dangerous. Every decision begins and ends with making money and self-aggrandizement. But it is his ability to be manipulated and influenced that make him the President of choice for men like Mitch McConnell. Over the years of President Obama's tenure and now into Trump's these men who want to promote their ultra conservative agenda have slowly become corrupted. They have abandoned all moral code to maintain their vast power. That is the great American tragedy.",

Why would the GOP be so ready and willing to hear from zero witnesses if there was even one witness that might refute the impeachment charges? Of course, the answer to these questions is (1) exculpatory witnesses for Trump do not exist, (2) witnesses will make the public aware of the evidence against Trump, increasing the percent who regard Trump as guilty (46% now, equaling Nixon\u2019s number just before he resigned) and (3) the evidence against Trump shows he is guilty, as charged. All this is why Trump and the GOP are not focused on airing liberating evidence and why the Senate trial of Trump will be as little about evidence as the GOP can get away with without being regarded as accomplices to Trump\u2019s high crimes and misdemeanors.",

He astutely recognized that he was being set up as the patsy and took action. if he were trying harder to get traction I'd be suspicious of him (not what he is saying about Trumps goons) but he isn't. That is a sign of a crooked man whom has recognized he is nicked and has surrendered to his fate. \n\nI think barfly is a bit much, pretty close to dishonest aspersion.\n\nWhat stood out to me in the few segments of the Maddow interview I have seen is his lack of Russian or Ukrainian accent.

By telling his story to the press and making it widely known that he was willing to work with the House Intelligence Committee, he's protected himself from the knifing apparently planned for him by the cabal of Trump's lawyers and did a public service as well.\n\nIt's also important to note that Parnas didn't like being zeroed out by Trump's \"I don't know him\" shtick.",

Instead, they claimed that the evidence was already \"overwhelming\" and impeached Trump, stating that the matter was urgent.  They then held onto the articles in the hope that there would be more accusations emerging.  And now the Dems want the Senate to do the investigation that the House refused to do.   Of course, we should brace ourselves for other \"evidence\" to emerge late into the trial (like in the Kavanaugh hearing), with hysterical cries that 'this' evidence will finally be the President's undoing.  Trump is no saint and he obviously acted inappropriately with Ukraine (like Biden) but it's not impeachable and Dems are acting worse with their mockery of the whole process.",

Its disconnect from the real world is total, and so they need each other to prop up their fake reality, keep each other going, submitting to their megalomaniacal leader. So yeah, everyone knows.

            "comment_body": "This column's solution to term limits won't work. Nonpartisan redistricting is never going to happen because incumbents don't want to compete for votes. Democrats are just as guilty as Republicans when it comes to gerrymandering. Gerrymandering by a party (say, Republicans) creates safe Democratic seats. It's in a Democrat politician's self-interest to help the GOP gerrymander, even though collectively the Democrats suffer. The Democrats don't oppose gerrymandering itself; the only oppose gerrymandering when the other guys do it. In Democrat-controlled states, Dems still gerrymander & show no signs of stopping that practice. Their only real complaint is what it's always been: The Democrats have fewer & fewer opportunities to game the system because the Republicans control more & more of the states. Right now it's impossible to fight to gerrymandering because you are bucking established Dems who would see their districts level out. The Democratic Party has zero interest in fixing this problem because our side wants the ability to cheat if & when they gain control of state legislatures. The only way to stop this problem once & for all is to have term limits for all politicians. For more insight into this issue, I urge everyone to read a brilliant NYT article in 2012 by Nate Silver. It proves beyond a reasonable doubt how corrupt both parties are when it comes to gerrymandering. Term limits are the answer.\n<a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/27/as-swing-districts\" target=\"_blank\">https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/27/as-swing-districts</a>-",

These people may hold more real power, due to their greater experience  and ability to make longer term contacts, than the people we actually elect.\n\nI put Steyer on the bottom of my list many months ago when he expressed his views about term limits in his ads.

The rare few who do, e.g. Elizabeth Warren, are prized legislators and we need to encourage them to stay. Others may gradually accumulate the experience they need over many years, and it is important for committee memberships etc to reward that. The many serious abuses we see in congress either reflect unthinking rewarding of time in congress by important committee memberships (e.g. Inhofe\non Armed Services; Commerce, Science and Transportation; Environment and Public Works, and Small business) or deliberate placement of lobbyists on the committees that should regulate their companies (e.g.  Andrew Wheeler at EPA).

If anything, weakening the strength of lobbies might stem from imposing term limits by making it difficult for lobbies to plan and strategize.\n\n2.

Given that most Americans pay attention to only sound bites, a forced exit might be a good way to refresh talent.\n\n3.  Forced exit is a good way to battle gerrymandering.  \n\n4.

A Representative takes his/her first year in office just learning the job, and the second year raising money and running for office, thereby corrupting the system with money they need to raise from various sources and interests. Then, if reelected, they now spend half of each term again raising money and seeking reelection. Also, an unpopular vote in the House that's also good for the country won't influence the Representative who may have more than one year for that vote to be shown to be correct (or wrong), an having to defend it immediately and constantly. Other problems could be solved by this solution, too, but M. Mouie is correct. Term limits give us inexperience where it's needed. JMHO.",

Even if under current laws around lobbying this is true, the answer isn't to keep people in power longer and give them more power, but to reform and rewrite the rules, and to enforce them.\n\nClearly our system is broken, and much of the cause is the overwhelming influence of money funneled to our leaders by special interests, and those who have seniority and the power that goes with that, get the most, and therefore are obligated to run things for the money providers. We must end this corrupt system! Perhaps we will learn that term limits are too restrictive and cause the problems you suggest, but most Americans would be willing to test that theory.

Most anyone should be able to grasp the goings-on in Congress, and if not, something is wrong.\n\nErgo, something is wrong, and redistricting, getting money (and religion) out of politics, and more will not fix it.\n\nWhat might fix it is less government, more efficiency, and transparency in (most) All Things, thus an ethical Congress.",

My wife works for Apple. Each year Tim Cook makes nearly 1,000 times what my wife makes. That is what Bernie is so correctly and eloquently talking about. This doesn't have anything to do with class warfare. This has only to do with right vs. wrong. Greed vs. the greater good.

From 1979 to 2018, worker productivity rose by 69.6 percent, while worker compensation rose only by 11.6 percent.\n\u2014 He claims that when companies become more productive \u201cthey earn more profit per employee and pay their workers more.\u201d Wrong yet again: higher profits do not automatically translate into higher worker pay. Brooks is assuming trickle down economics isn't a total sham. The truth is the share of corporate profits going to workers still isn\u2019t back to where it was before the 2008 financial crash.\n\nIf Brooks even did one iota of research, his entire argument would come crashing down around him.

Every discipline (sociology, political science and anthropology, etc) except economics gives \"power\" a central role in explaining human society. Those differences in power actually justify the focus on They. Those differences always have in human history.  For economists it's a voluntary exchange based on given endowments (how those skills are obtained isn't discussed --- its not \"freely chosen\") and wages are determined by competitive supply and demand and reflect the value of a laborer's marginal product.  Forget all that actual economic and labor history that argues otherwise. It's all seamless, rational and optimal, and absolutely impossible to question given the assumption of the voluntary nature of exchange being made --- no power, no coercion and costless to transact.  In a word it's \"perfect.\" It must be \"emotionally satisfying\" (Brooks term) to believe in the fairy tale that economic life isn't fundamentally political in nature. \n\nTAX RATES: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/06/opinion/income-tax-rate-wealthy.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/06/opinion/income-tax-rate-wealthy.html</a>\n\nINCOME INEQUALITY: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html</a>",

Though a more accurate analogy would be that the 'walker' was trying to run but was weighted down.",

And if the high-skilled worker produces great negative wealth/losses that individual just gets fired (and not charged or sued) - and their productivity losses are then written off, at least in terms of Brook's comparisons.

Both encourage and exploit polarization and tribalism for personal political gain. Both present significant threats to our democracy but in different ways and for different purposes. Trump flouts the law and treats the Constitution as a personal inconvenience and is concerned only for himself. He remains a would be dictator, blithely persistent in pursuit of personal power. Sanders, whether he admits it or not, or whether his followers realize it, is a Marxist at heart, his world view built around the Marxist narrative of economic exploitation. His threat to democracy lies in his commitment to a much greater centralized economy with a centralized government reapportioning  wealth according to a theory of exploitation and resentment. The greater the centralization of economic decisions, the more burdensome democracy becomes for the decision makers (the central committee!). Just as Trump supporters would happily trade freedom and democracy, for a mythical world that exists only in John Wayne movies, Sander supporters would similarly surrender democracy for a highly planned and controlled economic system that, in their mind, dispensed economic benefits freely and equally, especially to those supposedly disenfranchised. Sanders is touting a theory that has already failed. What both show is the tragic nature of democracy: people only support democracy when they get their way. Both terrify me",

Many of them are working in low growth industries that nonetheless provide essential goods and services. Those workers are the ones who are the hardest hit by unreasonable costs of living having to do with housing and essentials; not to mention HEALTH CARE. \n\n\"Productivity is the key to national prosperity\".  That may be true in a way, but as a closing statement it does nothing to justify the thesis of 'The Bernie Sanders Fallacy'. Sanders is not anti-capitalism, but he is correct about the injustice of gross economic inequality. \n\nFinally, this \"theyism\" idea is silly. Sanders is a deep thinker who has been consistent and unwavering in his ideas for a long time. Trump is a raving lunatic. They cannot be 'equalized' by being depicted as holding opposite ends of a 'theyistic' tug of war.",

These same people have no savings - retirement or otherwise.  These same people have seen the cost of healthcare and college grow 3-5x.   Suicide, drug overdose and other deaths of despair have tripled. 16% of working age non-degreed white men have dropped out of the labor pool for good.  Pensions dropped from 70% of workers to under 15% with an economic inability for the bottom 60% to save.  87% of Americans hold 10% of stocks, the bottom 60% have virtually zero. 100% of the productivity gains have gone to Capitol since the mid-1970s.

My conclusion: the more you see how the sausage is made, the more it is apparent that the game is deeply and pervasively rigged. Get more vocational skill training . . . what a laugh!

Well, that was before corporate boards across all industries started methodically off-shoring production and buying politicians in both parties to crush unions. Now, with robotics and AI, even creative economy workers are finding themselves \"redundant.\" Wage workers in America of all skill levels are being methodically reduced to penury.\n\nFrankly, in my whole life, I've never been as ready for radical political and economic actions as I am now . . . and, advice from \"thinkers\" like David Brooks doesn't figure much in that future.",

Thus far, American companies have had no compunction of doing just that, rather than advocate for equity in labor costs and championing  domestic policies lowering healthcare and education costs, for example, which would benefit their workers, albeit at paying those additional onerous taxes. They took the easy way out. Well Sanders and Warren are the leading Democratic hopefuls to address these issues, as well as others like climate change, infrastructure and human dignity. In their entirety they do not represent class warfare, as  David seems to interpret, because these policies benefit all Americans.

Workers are definitely not being rewarded by increased productivity. \n\nSome companies do wildly better than others. Why? Because of monopolies and oligarchies. If you engage in an unfair market that you control, of course you'll do better. Doesn't mean it's right or that it's capitalism. \n\nMr. Brooks says we need better education and training. Where's that coming from? A tax base that has had its standard of living decline since the 1970s. The above said monopolies and oligarchies are evading taxes. They aren't paying for enhanced education and training. We, the People, with no living wage can try, but it cannot continue. Our infrastructure is crumbling because we cannot pay for it anymore! \n\nI don't dislike rich people. I don't know them. I do know how to recognize a country being dismantled by giant tech and energy monopolies and real estate oligarchies.\n\nFinally, this idea \"increase productivity and we all thrive,\" how does that work as the Earth burns and we starve as a result? We need a path to a more equitable, sustainable future. With Bernie, we can start the negotiations toward that goal.\n\nSo in the 1930s, the capitalists could not give an inch and the result was Germany gone crazy, taking the rest of the world with it. In the end, forms of democratic socialism still came to Europe, standards of living rose, etc. So why do we have this bashing of a sane alternative to Trump?",

The baseline problem with Brooks' argument is that he continues to resist the self-evident truth that government must oversee markets to keep them competitive and transparent, and even then, government has obligations to the general welfare that no amount of private-sector competition and 'efficiency' will address.  The exploitation of our dispossessed and distressed fellow citizens is due in substantial part to the entrenched advantages of the wealthier and more politically powerful classes, continually reinforced by the actions of a privatized Congress.  With respect, I suggest that Brooks is going through a struggle between decades of indoctrination and the increasingly self-evident realities of specific aspects of civilization that private incentives will never realize.  Warren Buffet is aware enough and candid enough to acknowledge a long-standing class war, and that his class has won to this point.  A few corporate and financial executives have recently shared that recognition (cf. Black Rock CEO).  Past time that Brooks gave up trying to make an argument for feudalistic practices, including structural debt peonage, and start considering how to evolve a more balanced and sustainable political economy.",

Look at wealth distribution over that time and you will see a small segment of society capturing a tremendous amount of the overall wealth. Yes, some of this can be explained by things like productivity, but much of it is driven by policy choices that benefit a small elite. From our tax system to labor rights to trade, policy choices (not simply an organic evolution of productivity) have contributed to this dangerous disparity.

Security in a capitalist system is obtained by the accumulation of wealth. The bottom two income quintiles are completely insecure they have no wealth.  They can't access 400 dollars for an \"emergency\".  A 400 dollar surprise expense is ludicrously small when compared with a normal rent payment in most urban areas.\n\nThe third and fourth quintile have very little security by most accepted standards, 6 months of living expenses in liquid assets.  Wealth inequality tells the real us versus them story.  In fact 19 percent of US households have negative net worth.  Homelessness is on the rise, food insecurity is real, people really are rationing their drugs, serious illness really does bankrupt most people.  Productivity of a gig economy company is illusory because the overhead costs are shifted from the company to the worker.\n\nYes, we really do have a race to the bottom, Amazon is winning, brick and mortar is losing.

And it's not us vs. them but us vs. us: the exploiters are among us sabotaging the very system that made them. \n\nWe can require that capitalism have a conscience - with legislative carrots and sticks that punish or rein in human-greed inclinations to exploit and corrupt capitalism, to become conscienceless survival-of-the-fittest opportunists. Graduated income tax is part of it, not just for individuals but for corporations, the wealthiest of whom do indeed owe a great debt to the society that set the stage (e.g., built the roads, the bridges, the freedoms, the educations and health to sustain work forces, etc etc) on which they outperformed. But perhaps the biggest carrot/stick domain is the one you glossed over - the power of the wealthy to \"lock in\" their advantages by buying legislators to protect them. \n\nGetting money entirely out of politics is sine qua non if we want a capitalism with a conscience: Full public funding of campaigns, no more sources of quid pro quo leverage over public officials. The devastation of companies betraying workers by offshoring, etc was 'allowed' by compromised legislators and elected executives. \n\nThere are rein-ins if we care enough to demand them. Our sickness has been acquiescence. That's where impulse to greed and corruption seizes opportunity, dismisses conscience and rationalizes inhumanity.",

We are in another oligopolistic era today.\n\n\nRobber baron capitalist par excellence Jay Gould once gloated,  '\"I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half.\"   Fox News, anyone?\n\nSocial Darwinism, a self-serving corruption of actual Darwinian evolutionary theory,  was all the rage among the wealthy in the Gilded Age,  and well into the 20th C.  It said that if you're poor, its because you are one of nature's failed experiments: unfit. It's all your fault *and* it's in your nature.  Did I say into the *20th* Century?  \n\nIt took people like Jacob Riis and Sinclair Lewis to expose the utter lack of care that capitalism in practice (not theory) has for the working class, beyond it being a source of labor.\n\nIn response to burgeoning, rapacious, corrupt, colluding  corporations gaming the economy, in 1890 Congress enacted the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, which said that conspiracies in constraint of trade are illegal.  The Act was then used against...labor unions.  \n\n\nIn 1914, when Henry Ford started paying workers $5 for an 8 hr day, the Wall Street Journal called it an 'economic crime'.  The WSJ, mouthpiece of the capitalist elite, hasn't changed.",

It makes me think of Alan Greenspan, who served as Chair of the Federal Reserve of the United States from 1987 to 2006, preceding the Great Recession. HIs explanation of why he didn't interfere during the banking shenanigans that preceded the 2008 Recession was that he didn't believe that bankers would cheat. What about CEO Dennis Muhlenberg and the engineering staff of Boeing who attached a powerful new engine on a 60 year plane design and did everything in their power to avoid requiring extra pilot training, until not one plane but two fell out of the sky. I wonder what ego denying bull they were telling themselves between the two crashes. Pilots should know better????   You must ask yourself which of these smarty pants was in charge of Volkswagen when the deliberately designed their tail pipe emission systems so they would report dishonest results when they were put under test practically destroying a great company. Which of these brilliant business leaders were in charge when 12 of the 13 largest U.S. financial institutions were at risk of failure during 2008? None of these \"leaders\" went to prison.

CEO pay has risen 940 percent since 1978, while typical worker pay has risen a measly 12 percent.\n\u2014 He claims that capitalism is \u201crewarding productivity with pay, and some people and companies are more productive.\u201d Wrong again. From 1979 to 2018, worker productivity rose by 69.6 percent, while worker compensation rose only by 11.6 percent.\n\u2014 He claims that when companies become more productive \u201cthey earn more profit per employee and pay their workers more.\u201d Wrong yet again: higher profits do not automatically translate into higher worker pay. Brooks is assuming trickle down economics isn't a total sham. The truth is the share of corporate profits going to workers still isn\u2019t back to where it was before the 2008 financial crash.\n\nIf Brooks even did one iota of research, his entire argument would come crashing down around him.

The Revenue acts of 1926 and 1928 worked exactly as the Republican Congresses that pushed them through promised. The dramatic reductions in taxes on the upper income brackets and estates of the wealthy did indeed result in increases in savings and investment. However, overinvestment (by 1929 there were over 600 automobile manufacturing companies in the USA) caused the depression that made the rich, and most everyone else, ultimately much poorer. \n\nSince 1969 there has been a tremendous shift in the tax burdens away from the rich on onto the middle class. Corporate income tax receipts, whose incidence falls entirely on the owners of corporations, were 4% of GDP then and are now less than 1%. During that same period, payroll tax rates as percent of GDP have increased dramatically. The overinvestment problem caused by the reduction in taxes on the wealthy is exacerbated by the increased tax burden on the middle class. While overinvestment creates more factories, housing and shopping centers; higher payroll taxes reduces the purchasing power of middle-class consumers. ...\"\n<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/1543642\" target=\"_blank\">http://seekingalpha.com/article/1543642</a>",

In contrast, industries that support the physical and social fabric of society that are not easily automated --- construction, childcare, education have an inherent limit in their ability to increase productivity because it takes many hours of labor to generate a 'product' that is not easily capitalized on but provides a high actual value to society.

By reclassifying those at the very bottom of the system -- Uber drivers per say -- as \"independent\" contractors or something similar.  Or by ignoring those whose employment is tentative as best as they are forced to move from temporary position to temporary position.  Because they change jobs so often they are likely to fall of the grid when it comes to recording employment stats.  And then there's the long list of those who are citizens or legal residents, but who work illegally \"off-the-books\" simply because it's the best (or only) alternative they have.  \n\nThe fact of the matter is that economic and employment stats are like any other.  They can be made to prove anything you want, simply by redefining classes or changing definitions.   Right now, as Republicans are doing the hiring and firing within the civil service, those without employment, those with inadequate employment go under-reported.  Those who in desperation work off-the-record aren't recorded at all.   It's the only way that those happy with the current imbalance of wealth and economic bargaining power can continue to assure the rest of us that everything is \"just fine\".",

It does grow economies as it creates successful entrepreneurs, but that doesn\u2019t prevent those entrepreneurs from siphoning off greater and greater resources for their personal benefit. In fact, its entire design emphasizes that personal benefit as a means to of creating the incentives to engage in the difficult work of growing a business. It can, and does, reward selfishness, indeed that is seen as an essential factor in its worth. Yet that selfishness can, and does, sometimes cross a line into excessive indulgence, consumption for its own sake, or aggrandizement that increases economic power in order to also increase influence or political power. We can appreciate the value capitalism provides to our polity while also recognizing the dangers that allowing it to work unfettered can bring.\n\nSome of the restraint needed should be accomplished by the actions of government: some. Some should also be provided by active social measures that emphasize the unseemly face of greed and provide a desire for capitalists to engage in charity work along with generous giving. Many capitalists, unfortunately, see any criticism as an attack that must be thwarted with a full-on response in kind. This battle isn\u2019t the kind of centering mechanism we need. That notion of the importance of the public good does not prevent economic growth, but encourages it. Less vitriol, more good.",

If it's low, you get a low wage. This is called the marginal productivity theory. Later variations of this theory evolved into human capital theory, the idea that your wages reflect your individual skills and abilities (ie. \"human capital\"). I'm simplifying things for the sake of brevity, but that's the basic framework implicitly endorsed by David in this column. \n\nBut there's a problem here. What is productivity? Economists have absolutely no way of defining it separately from the very thing they want to explain: wages. They are reduced to a circular argument: productivity explains wages, but we first need to measure wages to know about productivity. A causes B, then B causes A! Productivity is difficult to compare in the real world. How do you compare the output of a farmer to that of a computer programmer? \n\nDavid cited a few studies in this column. These studies just look at sales per worker and assume that this qualifies as productivity. But again, they have no way of looking at productivity apart from the firm's revenue, so they're just measuring revenue and calling it productivity.",

Galbraith wrote of  growing income inequality, which is of course much more profound now then it was in the late 1950's.   I am not a Bernie supporter (though I will be if he is nominated). Bernie is not a \"socialist\" in the common imagination but a Social Democrat similar to the party that, for many years, ruled the most dynamic capitalist country in the post WWII era. That is Germany, a country that has also taken seriously Galbraith's call for a balance between production, productivity and social needs.   Galbraith knew that the achievement of one doesn't automatically achieve the satisfying of the other.

People are not born with a sense of personal responsibility, but have it inculcated into them. They do not possess it, so forcing them to rely on it will fail, proven to be true over generations. We must interfere in some lives in order to give them the tools that they need to become self-responsible, since it is not in the genes.\nConservative thinkers continue to act as if babies drop out of the womb with all of the knowledge they need, and we know this is bogus, backward thinking. It has been tested. If David Brooks would do one thing right in his life, he would tout Planned Parenthood in every column and shout about family planning from every soap box he could climb on to, since unplanned children in poor families, among the intellectually deficient masses 'out there,' is at the root of every social problem in the world. Overpopulation causes the climate change, due to the over-demand for energy, and the population grows the demand.

If the bosses have the workers by the throat, how can this be happening?\"\n\nThanks for the question.    I know owners who wish they could pay more but the business competition and their desire to be successful is often at odds with that desire.     This dissonance leads to what has become rationalizations prevalent in this culture to justify the historically low wages.    The owners I know don't want to anybody by the throat.\n\nBut more simply might the \"fast\" rising of wages for low level workers be a function of just how little they were being paid?  And might the incomes of those at the top be increased greatly by even a relatively small rate increase?   The poor will still be left with income insecurity that is not felt acutely by other levels in our society.\n\nThe increase for the poor is insufficient  and will remain so if capitalism remains unfettered.    How can we adjust and use capitalism to make substantive changes.    Is the trickle down we embarked on in the 80's really the answer?   After almost 40 years of it I still see trickle down as an excuse for turning our attention away from the vulnerable.\n\nI enjoyed your \"look back\" at the coming decade.

These are valid concerns and are worth debating. \n\nThe fact is that the wealth gap is only going to broaden until we have a government able to fix the issue. \n\nPete Buttigieg, Joesph R. Biden, Amy Klobachaur, Michael Bloomberg, etc. are all cognizant and most importantly, empathetic to the very real problem of wealth inequality in the United States. \n\nWhy would we vote for the most radical candidate of them all when we have amazing moderates that can appeal to the big tent coalitions? \n\nI won't vote for Bernie or Elizabeth Warren. I think it's foolish to insert another populist into the Oval Office. If anything Mr. T's should have taught Democrats is that antagonistic populism is a subversive force in our political culture. Democrats MUST win in 2020, or bye-bye democracy.",

A better indicator of income inequality would be the gap between the top 1% and the bottom 90% which is absurdly large and has been steadily increasing for decades. One reason for this is that people in the upper echelons of wealth tend to make more of their money, often a majority, through capital income, and the tax rate for capital gains is currently highly preferential. As for the bottom 90% who work to earn their less preferentially taxed income, the idea that \u201cpeople can\u2019t earn what they don\u2019t produce,\u201d is an oversimplification and an old talking point. Working harder does not mean you will necessarily get paid more or paid proportionately. The fact that both wages and productivity have risen during the same time period does not mean they are necessarily correlated. \nCompanies want to pay their low-level employees the minimum they can get away with in order to maximize profits. Labor is usually the biggest expense to a business which is why minimizing its cost is prioritized. Because low-level workers are unskilled or low skilled, and thus easily replaceable, companies don\u2019t have to worry about another company stealing them with better wages. The main source of leverage that these low-level workers have against a company is the ability to unionize, which companies are constantly fighting to prevent.",

I suggest you go spend 1 full day with the working poor... head to a construction site, hang out with a janitor, a cashier, a child care worker, with fast food workers, retail, the list goes on ... those people work hard as hell- they are very productive. Maybe in the big scheme of things, their company isn't as productive as the next .... but why should they suffer for this? There is a difference between individual productivity and corporate productivity. Ironically, corporate productivity (this inequality you speak of) is driven by leaders-- those who are making exponentially more than their very productive workers. Blame the leaders, not the workers. We need a *fair* system. \n\nJenny\nNurse Practitioner, Parent, Bernie supporter, Proletariat",

The wealthy are well aware they on a roll with explicit anti-union activities, massive use of illegal immigrant labor, suppression of Federal minimum wage increases, tax changes that overwhelmingly benefit only them, as well as some defunding of programs such as public higher education, public transit, consumer protection, food stamps, public housing, wildlife preservation, pollution control, and such that they don't need or don't want.

How is that at all comparable to Trumps brand of nativism?\n\nMaybe, Brooks is correct in that the watered down brand of fascism Trump offers is more palatable to voters than Sanders\u2019 progressivism, only in that it requires absolutely no individual sacrifice and still provides a reaction to the mess of modernity. That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t support Sanders politics, on the contrary, it means it requires more selfless effort from those who do understand the hardships of life today. \n\nLastly, and this is a small point, but most of this piece is basically just Brooks arguing that capitalism isn\u2019t so bad, in fact it\u2019s working exactly as its supposed. Won\u2019t disagree with you there, Mr. Brooks. This disconnect, though is a big one. We both think capitalism works as its supposed to, but for some reason you believe in its sink-or-swim nature, even lauding it for the fact it compensates skilled workers more, yadda yadda. But it\u2019s worth saying that many of us believe that all people, regardless of skill, etc... are worthy of living and living well, with access to health care and education.

Once in jail, they must pay exorbitant fees to make phonecalls and purchase needed personal care items. Excuse them for thinking the system is rigged.\n\nNow, take someone who makes $10, $11 or $12 an hour instead of the national minimum wage. Are they getting ahead? No, because those wages are what they should've been making 25-30 years ago. Now, to make it, they'd have to be making $17 to $20 an hour. Forgive the working poor for thinking there is a \"they\" that's against them when the promise (at best) is to raise the minimum wage to $12 (but never gets there).\n\nOh, that's right.

The minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 for decades and this largely benefits\u2014yes the billionaires. Meanwhile, while Rome is burning for so many in this country, talking heads tell us that interest rates should remain low to support wage growth. Hmm\u2014what economic class are low interest rates most beneficial to?  Billionaires, maybe?  Why does it have to be so complicated?  If the nation wants wage growth why not increase the minimum wage which if it kept up with inflation would be in the area of $22-23 per hour. 50% higher than the $15/hour movement. I\u2019d love to see you support a drastic increase of the minimum wage in one of your columns. That would drastically improve \"productivity\"  for a lot of families.",

First of all, why should wages not rise in proportion to the profits of a company? Why should workers settle for a smaller slice of the pie? They are the ones driving this putative productivity and the concomitant profits, they deserve a share of the goods that is commensurate with their work. They will never get it, however, precisely because of how capitalism is structured. Workers are never paid what they\u2019re worth, this is a well known problem that Brooks glosses over without understanding its implications. Wealth is the source of power in our society. As wealth becomes unequally distributed, the same occurs with power. This is why public policy reflects the interests of the wealthy and does not reflect the will of the people. Paid family leave, universal health care, better wages etc are enormously popular but they aren\u2019t instantiated in public policy because of the power imbalance caused by wealth inequality. As expected, Brooks doesn\u2019t mention this because it\u2019s fatal to his worldview.",

Let me briefly explain.\n\nIn neoclassical theory, your wages reflect your net (or \"marginal\") contribution to your firm. If your marginal productivity is high, you get a high wage. If it's low, you get a low wage. This is called the marginal productivity theory. Later variations of this theory evolved into human capital theory, the idea that your wages reflect your individual skills and abilities (ie. \"human capital\"). I'm simplifying things for the sake of brevity, but that's the basic framework implicitly endorsed by David in this column. \n\nBut there's a problem here. What is productivity? Economists have absolutely no way of defining it separately from the very thing they want to explain: wages. They are reduced to a circular argument: productivity explains wages, but we first need to measure wages to know about productivity. A causes B, then B causes A! Productivity is difficult to compare in the real world. How do you compare the output of a farmer to that of a computer programmer? \n\nDavid cited a few studies in this column. These studies just look at sales per worker and assume that this qualifies as productivity.

That is, they produce more goods for their employer thus raising the company's profit. The calculation is: total profit divided by number of employees equals productivity measured as profit per employee. However, some companies work the equation the other way. The number of employees is reduced, the remaining employees are expected to work harder and the total profit remains the same. Now the calculation yields a higher profit per employee because there are fewer employees generating the same profit. Fine for the company but not so good for those laid off.",

But Mr Brooks overlooks Bernie's overarching narrative, which is that the working and middle classes have been screwed for about half a century, largely as a result of government policy favoring employers and corporations, not due to 'productivity inequality'. Just to take one small example: if the 1968 federal minimum wage had kept pace with inflation, it would be about $22 now, instead of about $7. Why is labor taxed but not capital gains? Why can't we manage to provide affordable health insurance for all our people? The list goes on. The hollowing out of the country goes hand in hand with the government's half-century pro-business bias (through all administrations, Republican and Democratic, though worse in Republican). And if you don't believe it, compare the situation of working and middle class people in the U.S. to those in Europe: we are much less secure, much more vulnerable. Bernie's 'they' is really 'we' because we've allowed this to happen, and now we have to undo it, with President Warren or President Sanders and Democratic control of Congress. The question is really whether you think the country's ok and just needs some tinkering or there's something seriously amiss. As Elizabeth says, we need Big Structural Change.",

I think not: He states that a few super-successful corporations are running away from the rest and are moving to lock in their advantages. It seems to me that that is very close to what Sanders is contending.  We had this happen before in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and the remedy was to break up the monopolies, introduce income taxes and generally police the economy to create a more level playing field.  We need similar measures today and Sanders and Warren are the only major candidates who show any indication that they will try to do it.

It appears that Mr. Brooks believes that the distribution of those benefits over the last 20 years has been fair, which must mean that he believes that company executives have been getting hundreds of times more productive while employees have been getting 20% more productive.  Consider me skeptical.\n\nAlso, his analysis of superstar companies making more money per employee assumes that companies take their profits and distribute to them to their employees, which is generally not the case.  They typically buy back shares and give that money to shareholders.\n\nI am not a big fan of the democratic-socialist platform, but analysis like this which implicitly says that workers compensation is lagging CEO compensation because that is what is fair and just, is the exact kind of analysis that pushes people toward Bernie.",

These companies got that way not necessarily because they are inherently more \"productive\" than their competitors, most of them got that way because they had a first-mover status that in the digital age is almost impossible to overcome. In other words, they were more productive 15 years ago, and as a result they use their weight to eliminate most competition.  Think Amazon. Is Amazon more efficient than a local retail shop... yes, absolutely. Let's change the dynamic a little. Let's say \"Mom and Pops\" has a perfectly efficient website... are they going to compete with Amazon? No... Of course not! Because Amazon is a monopoly with incredible power. Most of which, paradoxically serves consumer's interest well. They negotiate for cheaper shipping, which they pass on to consumers. The net result, however, hurts workers. They can sell products at a loss, indefinitely, etc. Similarly, Facebook has a tremendously powerful positive network externality, meaning the series of networks it has amassed makes it incredibly difficult to compete against. \n\nSo, when Bernie says workers need more bargaining power you're only including one part of his message. Now, I'm not a Bernie fan, but there is an argument to be made that modern monoplies may need to be broken up and/or those who benefit taxed and the resulting largess redistributed.",

The real class war is evidenced in the control the extremely wealthy wield over our politics and social discourse. Prime example: They lobby to control laws and information flow to ensure protection of their profitability at the expense of the health of the planet and the people and animals on it. Whether it's truth about plastics, pesticides, or global warming, the facts and impacts are minimized while profits are maximized. And the very wealthy will be able to avoid the most horrible consequences of all of this while those at the bottom of the financial pyramid will starve. Sanders is the wrong guy to lead us when it comes to fighting class war, but he's not wrong about what has to be done.",

I have been reading a book by Stephen Hicks, \"Explaining Postmodernism\" which takes a different tack.\n\nHicks portrays a fight between socialists and capitalists that began as a reaction to the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nThe writings of Newton and Leibniz had transformed society by showing that it was possible for individuals to discover how the universe works, and this ultimately gave rise to the worship of individualism and reason, the rise of liberalism, as well as our technological age.  The ideas of liberalism are reflected in our Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n\nBut many intellectuals of the time were unhappy, partly because the rise of reason conflicted with people's need for religion.  Thinkers like Kant questioned our ability to achieve genuine knowledge, while Rousseau argued that the group was more important than the individual, and that the group should have the power to enforce conformity.  Rousseau's ideas were influential in the Reign of Terror in France during which perhaps 40,000 were executed in an effort to make society fairer to the disadvantaged classes.\n\nThis David Brooks essay is another contribution to the ongoing battle between the worship of reason and the worship of conformity.\n\nPostmodernism afflicts the academy, particularly departments of sociology, political science and economics, which often seem to abandon reason in a pursuit of the \"more important goal of multiculturalism.\"",

Not highly productive firms that outcompete everyone else. An analysis of the US labor market without this fact is nonsensically incomplete (John van Reenan would be the first to explain to Brooks if asked).\n\nBut this is anyway not what the Bernies et al are primarily talking about, but rather: exploding costs and uneven delivery of health care and of education. Areas where suppliers are increasingly exploiting the advantage that asymmetric information generates, yielding inefficient markets and under-delivery, just as economic theory predicts. Exclude those with little money and extract rents from those with. \n\nAnd market power that has its root in suppliers - the 1 percent - taking over the political process to secure their quasi-monopolies. See Betsy de Vos. In this regard it is of course 'us' against 'them'. No other advanced country has allowed entrenched interest to undermine the functioning of key markets as the US has.\n\nThe broader point though is that Brooks should simply stop writing about economics.

Yes, productivity (and automation) are huge factors in all of this, and yes, American workers need to be educated and trained for the next Industrial Revolution.

It's not about productivity or class warfare, it's about ensuring that everyone has equal access to the economy. You paint Bernie as a communist, obsessed with class warfare. He is a socialist, hoping to live in a country where not just the super-wealthy have access to power and prosperity.

Well, yes, a brain surgeon is more productive than a car wash worker, and consequently gets paid more. But Brooks ignores wage stagnation over decades despite increasing GDP and productivity, and even, in recent years, in the face of low unemployment. The average CEO makes something like 300 times as much as the average worker. Outside the pundit sector, in the business world, for decades, people have been working ever harder, faster, and longer for stagnant wages and disappearing benefits. Social insurance programs that people in other developed countries with no greater productivity than ours take for granted are minimal or nonexistent. Elected officials are bought by business interests and the wealthy, and laws are written by their lobbyists. In most of the country, absence of unions, and policies preventing organizing, are points of pride for officials. You don\u2019t have to be a Marxist to understand that those who hold wealth and economic power act to advance their interests, and that they do so at the expense of working people. That Bernie Sanders has gotten as far as he has indicates that to many Americans this imbalance has become too profound to ignore.",

Do the same dollar raise for someone making 25 to 26 and you get a 4% raise. This doesn't mean the wealthy don't have their workers by the throat, it just means it's easy to play with numbers to make a bad argument seem good.\n\nThere is a reason the author cannot use data focused specifically on wealth inequality. It tells the real story.\n\nThe issue here isn't that workers aren't highly productive or skilled enough. All economies rely on \"unskilled\" labor. Availability of higher wage jobs don't just appear from competition and increasingly skilled workers. If every Target employee quit tomorrow and took out a loan for a collage degree or trade school, only a few of them wouldn't work at Target after they're done.

That the rest of us pick up the slack with our tax dollars- we pay when someone doesn't have healthcare, needs food assistance, housing assistance, etc. Most of those who get assistance work. This assistance to these workers is corporate welfare.\nWe need to stop blaming people for making low wages that they cannot afford the elements of living. It is not their fault.",

You can buy a fancy house that is beyond your means. Yes. You can buy a gigantic truck that costs almost as much as a house in some places. But the fact is that neither of these material \"riches\" actually build wealth. For many mortgage and insurance costs makes a home often seem more like an economic drain. That big truck, for which one can't even find a parking spot for, is worthless as an investment. Raises for the higher ups are ridiculous, while for the poor and even the middle-class is often only enough to pay for the increase in home taxes, food, education, and the annual increase in health care. It is impossible to build wealth because even if you save money at the bank what you get in interest is abysmal. For women, poor whites and minorities it is even worse as their salaries are often lower than that of white collar men. There is a they and and us, David.

There is no accident here; this was accomplished by design. Put it this way: a poor black guy caught selling illegal drugs in the innercity in many states can put away for life, while an elite group of Wall Street bandits can create a global crisis leading to the great recession and not in any way be held accountable for their crimes.

Everything will be free, no need to work. No need to get educated, no need to struggle, no need to save. It's all done by committee. Need money..take it from the rich. Need housing, take their mansions and fill them with the needy.  Take a few places where that has been tried, the defunct Soviet Union is the a good place to start. It quickly devolved into a punishing Dictatorship that killed millions by edict and War. Take the French Revolution...In a few years, after killing the Nobles and the King, France crowned an Emperor for life. Take the Spanish Civil War. There were \"utopian\" villages that tried it out. What was the result. a forty year military dictatorship, followed by the Dictator creating a Representative Democracy before he died.  Those that say, our system gave us Trump are wrong. The people gave us Trump by not voting. The idea was, that his election would lead to a massive movement to replace our system of Government. Maybe it will as Trump devolves into a classic Fascist Dictator for life who controls all the means of production and removes the \"undesirables\" by deportation and/or imprisonment or used as cannon fodder in his Wars.

Millions of university graduates staggering under debt while the banks and financiers get richer and richer. Even Piketty knows that! Of course it is rigged.

But, in the opinions of most young Americans, an economy that needs to learn to serve society SOCIALLY.  And environmentally, not just economically. An economy to create social wealth, not just private wealth (think Denmark). Now the US economy does not provide a rich satisfying life to too many people. Even the people it serves must matriculate in a destructive rat race and make their kids endure a child's version of the rat race...so they can grow up to ...join the rat race.

Then, when that executive goes to the board meeting for another company, he, in turn, approves massive compensation packages for the other executives.\n\nHow about this? Create a huge tax incentive for companies that pay their top employees \"only\" 100 times their lowest paid employee.  \n\nSo, if your lowest paid worker gets $20,000, and the CEO \"only\" gets $2 mil or less in total compensation, then the company gets a huge tax break.  If the company wants to pay the CEO $4 mil and keep the tax break--fine, raise the lowest paid worker's salary to $40k.  But if the company pays their CEO $100 mil and pays their lowest paid employee $15k -- they can do that, no problem. But their tax bill is going to be huge.

The reason that \"this is happening\", that wages at the bottom are growing faster is that so many states--particularly by referendum--have raised their minimum wage.

Labor needs a voice and a seat at the table to negotiate better compensation and check against management. \n\nThe worst thing to happen was Freedman's assertion that corporation's only goal is to \"maximize shareholder value\" which changed everything starting in the 80's through present. The new CEO with this as their bible gutted companies and shipped jobs aboard to minimize costs. This was also driven by the investors as well. Hopefully things are changing with the announcement from BlackRock and the business round table. Corporations aren't inherently bad or good, if the nature is to return value to all stakeholders not just shareholders the outcome will be positive for society.\n\nIt's not income inequality it's wealth inequality. The issue with the mega rich is that they have access too and use markets to create capital gains on existing wealth. The fed has propped up the market through QE thus allowing for inflated gains amongst the very rich. Something like 50 or 60% of all Americans are not invested, which means they are missing a huge wealth gaining instrument. The good thing is that market access is so easy these days that anyone can invest.",

We want a strong economy not because a strong economy is good in itself but becausue it enables us to achieve our non-economic goals.\n\nIt seems to me that two of the central values of all human societies  are fairness and justice. Capitalism as it is practiced these days is unfair and unjust. The irony is that Trump's promise to \"drain the swamp\", to  punish China for stealing jobs, to restore good old Anmerican manufacturing and mining jobs etc, all these prmises appealed to these values. That's why so many centrists and independents voted for him. That's why the Democratic hopefuls have to emphasise fairness and justice. Eg, the present tax system is unfair to the 99%. Dumping pollutants into the air, earth, and water is unjust. And so on.\n\nThe Dems' campaign is at bottom about fairness and justice. \"Class war\" is a distraction, especially so in a country where a sizeable minority freaks out at any hint of \"socialism.\"",

The decline of unions, the increase of \"right to work states (which stands the phrase on it's head), the decline in the number of public companies and the increase in the number of Private Equity firms and hedge funds buying  companies, saddling them with debt and foisting them back into public markets. The huge pay increases of CEOs and upper management vs median worker wages. When such industry titans are fired or removed for cause, they leave with golden parachutes that would make many kings weep with envy. Their political connections and lobbying of government officials make nearly all of them immune to prosecution. Recent legal changes are turning our government into a one dollar one vote system from a one person one vote republic. The decline of support for higher public education budgets at state schools causing the rocketing increase in student debt (states used to pay approx 80% of operating costs, today about 30%). The protections of bankruptcy are denied for the resulting student debt.   At the same time, our governments have allowed our infrastructure (roads, bridges, public transportation systems, municipal water systems, public buildings) to stagnate and rot from a lack of maintenance and improvement which, if provided, would add many good paying jobs and be a tremendous boost to the economy. Instead we are told tax breaks for the rich will Trickle Down -eventually.",

What the socialists, including Bernie, want to do is to raise all workers at the same rate as those who contribute the most.  That is not a prescription for long term success in any economy.\n\nThe idea that a rising tide lifts all boats is still true.  It is just that the unprepared do not get lifted as much.\n\nSo what does a society do here?  Better education is the key which can start in the home with parents who try to do better in the modern world.  Unfortunately, the drawback here is the cost of higher education, although not all students are capable of going to elite schools.  State schools can to a fine job with much less cost.  If that is not economically possible, a good trade school can also make a difference.  Just do not walk out of a high school and expect that any one is waiting out there to make you rich.",

But Bernie's solution is to take my insurance away from me and the 140 million Americans who purchase it because it is unfair to someone else.  This is classic Marxism.  You demonize the insurance industry.  You give people a government controlled insurance and the 3 million people who work for the insurance industry get \"billions in government money\" (quote from last debate).  More government control.\n\nWhether it's the \"speculators\" who make housing unaffordable.  (Bernie owns 3 houses) Or the multinational corporations, or Big Pharma there's always a villain.  The answer is more government control.  That's Marxism.\n\nThe Green New Deal is a new Politburo making economic decisions for individuals.\n\nPlease nominate someone else.",

But he doesn't name, in any concrete way, what this \"productivity growth\" entails, or how it benefits society. Indeed, most of the celebrated \"innovations\" of the past several years are really just things that have been around for a century or more reimagined as \"tech.\" Uber is really just what used to be called a gypsy cab, except with an app that allows an enormous stream of revenue to be siphoned off to some callow Silicon Valley-based jerks. AirBnB is just an souped up classified section for a bunch of illegal sublets. And how is ordering a book off of Amazon superior to walking to a bookstore and buying it there? Are cities better with a bunch of independently--owned bookstores or with a bunch of pod people, hiding in their apartments waiting for their Amazon and \"Door Dash\" deliveries to arrive?\n\nAs to Bernie Sanders \"classwar\" rhetoric: His biggest weakness is that he has to pass through the clownshow that is the Democratic Primary. This forces him to yoke broadly popular economic positions with broadly unpopular social positions: \"Medicare for all\" is a remarkably popular position in polling, and even a number of Republicans support it. \"Free sex change operations for illegal immigrants\" is a rather less popular position.",

They were identical in their academic attainment levels. Joe's parents had a million bucks, Steve's had just a hundred (which they needed to pay the electric bill). Though their academic skills were on a par, Joe's parents enrolled him in Princeton Review, which not only didn't improve his grasp of English, reading comp, and math, but helped him un-learn the cognitive skills that might interfere with maximizing points. Thereby, Princeton Review corrupted his actual intellect in order to AMPLIFY his *apparent intellect* in the form of high SAT scores, which in reality partially reflected his un-learning of actual math and English. This service cost Joe's parents $2500, but it was worth it, because he was admitted to Wharton where the Princeton Review lesson of getting more from less was amplified as a comprehensive world view and way of life. Joe got rich selling vaping equipment to people like Steve, who wound up at local community college.\"\n\nProductivity (like real learning in the parable) doesn't get money, though it can. Money directly & indirectly gets money. The more you have, the easier it is to get, because money AMPLIFIES your powers (or apparent productivity), just as lack of money diminishes.",

Also I'm curious as to his figures on rising productivity leading to increases in wages.  We all know that the biggest gain in productivity has been due to automation which has lessened the work force numbers, which in turn means the remaining workers get paid more.  But that leaves more workers on the sidelines or going to those lesser skilled jobs, like in the service sector.    Which then means those lower skilled jobs with lower wages repeat the cycle.  Our economy has turned to  a service based economy that requires less skills.   We have outsourced everything else.  That is the real issue behind income inequality in this country now.",

Sure, education and technological changes matter. But public policy and active (or inactive) governmental decisions shape markets and shape the distribution of wealth and income across the U.S. I recommend \"The Great Risk Shift\" and \"Winner-take-all-Politics\" to understand the political factors that Sanders/Warren are speaking too and seek to address. \n\nYes, \"Theyism\" or otherization can be dangerous, especially when utilized by demagogues to vilify and attack vulnerable populations. But a commentary on contemporary American capitalism and its extreme inequality must look at how the very wealthiest among us have radically restructured the economy to overwhelmingly benefit themselves. Moreover, looking only at economic metrics misses how much of an outsized influence wealthy elites and businesses have over policy decisions. \n\nI think, Mr. Brooks, it is important, if not essential, to take these factors into consideration.",

They need to increase productivity. So they fire 3,000 workers who make fewer widgets per day than their fellows. \n\nTheir payroll was $234,000 per hour. The layoffs result in reduced payroll, but as an incentive they raise wages to $21 per hour. The payroll is now 210,000 per hour, a savings of 24,000 an hour or $48 million per year. \n\nThe laid-off workers find jobs involving a deep fryer and potatoes, at $12 an hour. Three thousand people are now hovering near poverty at $24,000 a year. \n\nThe Company further increases production by making it known that if individual numbers don\u2019t go up, the slackers will be laid off in the next round of firings. \n\nEconomists gleefully report that the average wage of these 13,000 persons (in Xtown) is no longer $18 an hour, but just under $19 an hour, an increase of 99 cents.

He never answers readers, never engages us. \n\nMost longtime readers know he offers ideas every column, and once in a while produces a good one, just because his idea mill is so wide ranging and constantly humming.  \n\nBut one area he truly has no clue about is movement politics.  His column on Occupy was his cluelessness at an apogee.  It practically predicts Sanders.  The problems it mentions have been unaddressed since it was written 10 years ago  <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/opinion/the-milquetoast-radicals.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/opinion/the-milquetoast-radicals.html</a>\n\nSanders is a movement politician.  This means he does not think in terms of class enemies as Brooks so obviously fears.   He knows the \"secret\"--pressure is needed to achieve justice.   And this pressure is not class warfare.  It is actually good for the elites.  It prevents our society from becoming so unequal that people start kidnapping rich babies for ransoms.  Sanders is doing the rich a favor.",

It is no wonder the Finland in the last decade has been ranked the most stable country in the world, and was ranked first in the World Happiness Report for 2018-19.

One simply indicates the average hourly real wage paid to workers , The other indicates productivity of these workers, the value of the goods and services produced by workers in an hour. \n\nAs you can see, from about 1946 to 1973 these two curves moved in lockstep. When a worker produced more value, he got paid more. This period, 1946 - 1973 has been called the Great Prosperity during which GDP growth averaged 3.8% and real median household income surged 74%. \n\nStaring in 1973, the curves began to pull apart. Productivity continued to increase, but wages flattened. For a few years after 1980, the election of Reagan, real wages actually dropped. After that productivity continued to rise, but wages has stayed low, thus getting further and further away from productivity. \n\nThe result of this can be seen in the second graph which shows where the money went:\n <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html</a> \n\nYes, it went just where you thought it went.",

Mr. Brooks, it's the economic policies of people like yourself that brought enough economic devastation to much of industrial America to create the millions of voters who were desperate enough to vote for somebody, really anybody who didn't promise to be just more of the same. In 2016, that \nalternative was Donald Trump, as Hillary Clinton was (rightly?) seen as pure elitist neoliberal establishment.

Workers simply don't want a token bone thrown under the table when they start to growl. They want to see that when they are productive  and the company succeeds, they share in the fruits of the labor.  When you see the company profit and the only beneficiaries are those at the top, why does it surprise you that those at the bottom would have a problem with that?  Saying the workers should just shut up and gnaw on that bone is like saying Blacks in America should stop looking for equality. And stop looking at the glass as half empty.  That empty space above the water isn't really a bad thing.  Newsflash:  it is.",

This economy is certainly benefiting them more than the rest of us-- as always! We show raise their taxes and pay off the debt with that money before it ruins us.",

Perhaps if Mr. Sanders were a little more radical, instead of jumping on the Republican/Democratic bandwagon of having the state solve our problems instead of all of us solving our problems, he might be believable.  At present, neither he nor most other Party pols, left or right, have accurately identified the problem.\n\nUs liberals need to get back to being liberal.  Being liberal gave us our Constitution.

First and foremost, when he's referring to \"us\", he's referring to the mass majority of this country, 99% in fact. When Bernie speaks, he's directing his anguish at the 1%. Don't make this seem like it's a 50/50 issue when it is not.\n\nNext, the author admits that better schools or vocational training are key to increased productivity. Our current president and his abysmal Sec. of Education have weakened our school system and have done nothing to improve affordability or access to higher education. Investments need to be made desperately in our children, starting as early as Pre-K and all the way through High School to ensure equitable access to a strong education.  In addition, higher education, whether it is a college degree of vocational training, MUST be made more accessible and affordable. Not every student needs to be able to afford Harvard, but when low-income individuals cannot access higher education, the cycle of wealth inequality will continue unabated. Bernie has always spoken truth to these issues and has made it clear that it would be a priority under a Sanders administration.\n\nFinally, the author's stance on wage increases at the bottom increasing is lacking data. Luckily for us, the internet exists. Since 1978, american workers have seen an 11.2% increase in wages. CEO's? 973%. Tell me again how our current system is good for workers? \n\nThe system needs a change, and Bernie might just be the key.",

The returns to capital have been higher than the returns to labor since 1979 when the late Paul Volcker, then Fed Chair, raised interest rates to  very high levels to trim inflation.  When the Republicans passed the huge tax cut in late 2017, observers predicted that the main beneficiary, corporations, would pass on much of the savings to their workers.  They didn't.  They also didn't invest in new plant and equipment, because they were uneasy about the future.  They used much of it to buy back shares, which they assumed, rightly, would rise.\n\nCapitalism has virtues, but it also generates inequality.  Bernie promises to do something about that.",

Forty percent don\u2019t have the cash to cover a $400 emergency expense. They can\u2019t think of retirement. None of this is of is inevitable. Much of it is the result of social policy mistakes, including indifference to the loss of blue-collar jobs, insufficient health care coverage, embrace of a highly unequal education system, tax giveaways to tycoons, billionaire friendly court decisions, acceptance of growing inequality, and systematic underinvestment in children and community services. Government too often has sided with capital over labor, and that has undermined unions and weakened wages. The minimum wage is $7.25, it should be $22 if adjusted to inflation since 1968. Flexible work schedules have also increased stress even more than low wages. Meanwhile 95 million Americans of workign age are not working. The labor participation rate is about 62 percent, substantially below all other developed coutries. During the Great Recession, the government rescued Wall Street banks, not Main Street. QE helped the rich by inflating stocks, which are mostly owned by the rich. The housing bubble helped the banks and real estate moguls, not the ten million families that lost their homes.

That's elementary boomer era economics. Of course it still matters - but productivity at what? Not in making more widgets per hour, that's for sure. Within 20 years, agricultural, industrial and transportation productivity will have risen to the point that human inputs will be insignificant. How will our society be structured when workers aren't needed? That's the big question Andrew Yang is asking.\n\nBrooks also ignores the pernicious slant of network effects in the tech era. A core premise of capitalism is that imitators and copycats serve to keep costs and prices down. Network effects (the more people that use a system, the more valuable the system) prevent that. I can launch an alternative social network platform to Facebook but will fail because Facebook users and friends and friends friends are all committed to Facebook's platform. In the world of Tech Capitalism, the big get bigger and bigger... not because they're better, but simply because they are bigger.\n\nSanders doesn't understand the problem correctly, but he viscerally feels the need to solve it.

Perhaps higher level wages are not rising as much as lower tiers because they already have risen so much - compare ratios from the 1960s to the present.\n2. Of course more successful companies will be more productive and offer better wages than less successful ones, especially in an age of cheap often highly automated and often offshore production.  \n3. Taxes are one of the keys - higher taxes for high income earners and wealthy investors were part of the much more equal wage/wealth of the 1950s and 1960s.  The rush toward lower taxes, the trickle down concept, starting with reagan in the 1980s, fueled the disparities and continues to be strong drugs of illusion for middle and lower income Republican voters.",

Or does he believe that American workers should pound sand?\n.\nWhat Mr Brooks misses in his piece is the rise of automation in manufacturing.  The productive companies today are the companies that have used automation to benefit their productivity.  These companies don\u2019t have exceptional workers: they have just leveraged technology to replace more workers; so by the old measures of productivity, it looks like their workers are more productive.  More importantly:  fewer workers are necessary.  One man, with a computer-driven machine can do the work of ten men with \u201cdumb\u201d machines; of one hundred men with hand tools on an assembly line.  \n.\nIt may be possible to temporarily stop this loss of jobs by slamming the doors shut to new immigrants.  Thereby crimping the demand for work when the supply is dropping.  And this is exactly what Trump and his supporters are doing.  (I happen to disagree with it btw).  Ergo the first part of my question for Mr Brooks.  If Brooks doesn\u2019t agree with this approach, what does he suggest?  Or is he saying that workers should pound sand?",

            "comment_body": "\"Every time we increase productivity for one person, we all thrive a little more, together.\"\n\nIs that the new way of saying a rising tide lifts all boats?\n\nThe truth is that raw, unregulated capitalism, like any unregulated system in which profit is the driving force, does exploit workers, most of whom don't even own boats and live far from water. This has always been true. In caveman times, the guy with the biggest club won; serfs and peasants who owned nothing could be put down easily by armed henchmen of feudal lords. And did slaves begin to thrive as their productivity increased?\n\nHistory shows us that there have always been greedy, unscrupulous people willing to take advantage of others in order to thrive themselves. And history also shows us that many of those people have been able to consolidate so much wealth and power they have been able to shape society so that, for example, an institution as insidious as slavery became acceptable to many.\n\nIt's a mistake to blame our ills solely on capitalism because bad actors in nominally socialist countries (think Russian oligarchs) are also a huge problem. But people who worship at the altar of unfettered capitalism and claim that increased productivity is the answer to our problems, are even more mistaken.\n\nIn this time of Citizens United, as wealth and power become consolidated among fewer and fewer individuals, it is time to listen to those who are saying that capitalism, like any system, has flaws, and must be regulated.",

Counting every form of income, and all employees, so no loopholes. Jail those who break these rules. If execs want to earn more, they have to make sure their employees also earn more. Why should the executive get a huge paycheck if the company is not doing well? And if it is doing well, why should the executive get the reward but the worker does not?\n\nAnd if a company supposedly cannot pay great wages because its workers have low productivity, as for example fast-food businesses, why should their executives get paid as if they generate more profit than their 'unproductive' workers? Obviously they don't.",

The problem today is abundance. With technologies such as robotics, AI, genetic engineering, industries' capacity to produce goods without human labor is increasing everyday. Is it a surprise that labor pay is stagnating? Mr. Sanders is only partly right to blame the executives and the rich stock holders of companies controlling these technologies. They are operating properly within a 20th century frame work. Mr. Trump instead likes to blame foreign labors and immigrants. He is not entirely wrong that foreign competition is driving down wages but he is entirely shortsighted. What is happening now in America will be happening in China in a few years. Within a couple decades, automations eliminate the need for human labor as we know it. Is the solution to punish big companies as Mr. Sanders suggests? This would be foolish because they are producing so much prosperity that most people actually do not need to do menial labor. Is it the solution to severe international ties and make the world a more dangerous place as Mr. Trump is doing? He is a fool who has not learned from the past world wars. There are no simple answer. Our society need to find new meanings for people to strive for, making money is not it, and making sure that we are not lacking in material needs that will be plentiful.",

If the lowest-paid Americans are doing better now than they had been it's only because their wages have risen to a level at which they're no longer literally starving to death.  Having to choose between paying the rent and purchasing medication is pretty much where they're at now.  Insofar as the rest of us are concerned, we can see that the affluent (especially those of inherited wealth) keep growing more and more so thanks to the tax advantages which their bought-and-paid-for politicians have been able to write into the law on their paymasters' behalf.  And then, of course, there are those tax shelters overseas in which so many of them manage to hide their wealth.  When the rich become legally responsible for the poor (thus freeing the working class from the burden of paying for the services and benefits that provide them with life's necessities) and when profit-sharing is instituted across the board so as to create an inextricable bond between the rich and those whose labor creates and/or sustains their wealth I'll be pleased to acknowledge that America's class warfare has finally come to an end.",

These workers contributions are not met with proportionate rewards for what they bring to the success of their companies.  \"People can't earn what they don't produce\"? Seriously?  The productivity of American workers is the highest, unsustainably, in history.  Despite this, compensation, like cream, always seems to rise to the top.  An vivid example of this is Boeing which chose to lay off thousands of talented American engineers/programmers to save a few bucks on its latest design.  We all know, as do the families of those dead airplane passengers, how that worked out.  Was the executive compensation cut despite the billions lost with suspended production and legal liability?  Oh, that's right, more employees got laid off. Just stop with the  propaganda. nd... let's be clear-eyed, there are many who don't get to the top bases on talent and dedication but, rather, on connections.  They don't have to be gifted; that's why they hire talented, undercompensated employees. We are living in a new, more extreme Gilded Age.",

There is a reason people are turning away from capitalism- it doesn't work for the working and middle class. Stagnant wages, no investment in social programs, unaffordable healthcare and insanely expensive college- these are the evils of capitalism.   Also, Bernie is doing well among the midwesterners who you claim care more about guns than their own wellbeing. Americans aren't stupid- culture wars only divide the worker- without meaningless culture wars, the enemy becomes apparent: it is the oppressing class whom you constantly defend. Lastly, Bernie does not claim a \"vague manegerial class\" is oppressing the proletariat- the billionaire/millionaire class is. They are the ones who influence politics in their favor, make hundreds of billions on the backs of their workers without doing any of the labor or even paying taxes, and brainwash the public into thinking they too can be rich when most either inherit or make it in unsavory ways. Stop defending the rich- the people who need defending are the workers. That's what Bernie is doing, and that is the only way the Democrats can beat Trump.",

It became too easy to fire people for no reason, to search for the perfect, and non-existent, applicant, and to misuse temps.\n\nThe back end of the baby boom generation was unlucky enough to come of age when our country decided to stop being progressive, to stop investing in citizens, and to live on sailboat fuel.

One doesn't need to  accept even the \"Warfare\" designation of \"Class Warfare\" (yes, most people I believe want to be \"good people\") to see the ways that \"those\" with money and power seek to increase \"their\" money and power. And also to see how succesfully implemented these ways have become.\nSo this doesn't in any way have to be about \"they\" and \"we\" - that's just the go-to of human nature I suppose (and there's enough of it to go around, unfortunately).

Stiglitz notes that between 1970 and 2010 the upper 10 percent saw their average pretax income soar, while the bottom 90 percent saw their pretax earnings flat-line.  And to add to the insult, workers displaced by technology and/or trade are told they can train for new careers, even though the \"new jobs\" usually pay less, and often require people to leave the homes they love to search for jobs among strangers.

These \u201csuper businesses\u201d will hire 18 recent college grads as 18 month temp employees for 9 vacancies they need filled. Pitting one worker against another in an 18 month productivity battle royal with no company benefits, including health care.  18 months later more than half of these temp workers\u2019 job ends and a new batch of hungry drone bees are brought in.  Immoral at least buy HIGHLY productive.  Further, to say that the productivity value of a Sears appliance sales person is less than that of a retail distribution tech at Amazon Web Services is inane.  The appliance sales person drove to work, maintained a car, used a dry cleaner, shopped for food at a market and took a family to the movies. The AWS Reich probably works at home, uses Uber, spending his 4 hours of down time watching bootleg movies on YouTube.  If we see the productivity of the super businesses as Brooks does, we lose the intrinsic value of work in America. If we lose that we move one step closer to exclusively selling souvenirs to rich tourists in quaint village shops facades built by the super businesses to skim off the last vestige of the impulse buy left in the unproductive old economy.",

This includes a whole lot of stuff that should be \"free\", although we all know that nothing is really free and what \"free\" really means is \"paid for by someone else\".  The great trick of socialism is convincing people that all this free stuff is a \"human right\" as opposed to something that you actually have to work for.    \n\nThe great irony is that this is exactly the same playbook that Trump runs to stir up anti-immigrant sentiment among his base.  In a classic case of \"running with blinders on\" those same progressives that love to bash Trump for engaging in \"blame\" politics completely fail to see that Bernie is doing the same thing, just with a different target in mind.",

I won't add to them. But his final sentence tells it all. \"Every time we increase productivity for one person, we all thrive a little more, together.\"\n\nSo when the rich get richer, based on their skill, knowledge, creativity, hard work and productivity, we all share in that bounty.\n\nExcept 90% of the readers know that's not true. However, this article raises a very basic question. Where does wealth really come from?\n\nBrooks assumes that it comes from the dynamism of hard charging entrepreneurs. In other words from capital and the managers and wise investors of capital.\n\nThe alternative view is that wealth is generated from the labor of workers. They can be blue color workers who run machines or even sweep floors. Or white collar workers like clerks, administrators, engineers or medical personnel. \n\nPut another way, if you want a new house you may go to a bank for a loan, but to produce that product you got to an architect, landscapers, contractor, carpenter, plumber etc.\n\nBernie's critique is that their productivity is what drives an economy. Yet the vast majority of the wealth they produce is kept in the hands of capital.\n\nMaybe that's not a class war. But it's certainly a dysfunctional system.",

But, when studies and observations of those workers over the last 50 years show workers are more productive and working harder than ever and that pay and benefits are not keeping up there is undeniable conflict.  A recent Times article stated that had wages over the last 50 years kept up with inflation, the minimum wage of the American worker would be $22 an hour today!  We can't get our selves to share $15.  Meanwhile, housing, healthcare, and transportation are more expensive and often unaffordable for many.  When Americans have to work 2 and 3 jobs to survive, life expectancy is dropping, growing numbers are becoming homeless, and deaths by despair through suicide or control substance is rising, something will have to give OR it will be taken.

I would argue that laws facilitating tax exemption, company value being calculated through a bottom-line, and a race to the top for all of these companies does not allow for the benefits outlined in this opinion to become a reality. Year after year, we see some companies report record profits while executing mass lay-offs to further extend their bottom line in future years. Why would a company pay more for its existing work-force if they can achieve better results next year for the same price? Capitalism is a useful tool in motivating innovation and economic growth in a nation, but the legislature of that nation should ensure that economic growth is reinvested back into schools, communities, health, and security at home. This is seen to an extent in many other nations which grow socially alongside their economy, but not in the US - where economic growth in communities can sometimes result in worse conditions for the general population. I have no background in economics, but it seems rather counter-productive to respond with anti-capitalist sentiment and concerns regarding unequal wealth distribution by saying that certain companies aren't productive enough. Especially when many of these problems are coming from the top - where companies like Amazon face the most scrutiny in this.",

Yeah right.  Somehow I don't think those folks in the midwest were cheering them on.\nBrooks is obviously no economist and should refrain from writing about such topics.  His analysis is nothing more than an exercise in cherry picking.\nWithin the context of the global marketplace labor has become merely a factor of production rather than a human resource where productivity is measured.  \nSo, labor has been reduced to an equation of comparative advantage where productivity plays no real role in outcomes.  \nWhere the U.S. still leads is in the realm of innovation.  This is an area where productivity can actually be meaningfully measured. \nBut the same principle applies.  If Capital could pay some guy in India, who has no electricity and no running water, 10 cents to be innovative or a PHD here in the U.S. $1.00, patriotism would go right out the window.  Both workers are equally productive the difference is the cost of that productivity to capital to obtain a particular outcome.",

It all depends how productivity is measured and the least we can say is that the turn toward metrics we have seen has been a turn toward tyranny of measures becoming the goals themselves and replacing the actual goal. Efficiency , meaning inputs per output, is only one way of measuring productivity. How happy we are as a people is another way. Neither method alone is sufficient but both measures as well as many others are unnecessary. Think of it this way, we can always increase a class size endlessly but it is always at the expense of the quality of the education. One-on-one tutoring would probably be the best approach but clearly that would be far too expensive. So we have to try and strike a happy medium. For the past 40 years we have been increasing class size and that's it. Any simple measure of productivity per teacher would be going up but when we look at the results from students that is much more easily said than done. It's easy to understand why when class sizes are just continually increasing. Mr. Brooks takes a very narrow view. More's the pity.

If we just re-dressed that imbalance--increased the tax on capital gains and ended the stepped-up basis, restored the inheritance tax, assessed Social Security tax on income up to 95% of median income, added more income tax brackets for higher incomes, repealed the TCJA, and enforced the existing tax laws--we'd make considerable progress towards restoring balance, and we'd have a lot more money to spend on important societal needs that now go begging. Nothing I've suggested is new or untried.  Most of it was the law until quite recently.  It's just that the rich have been fighting and winning a class war while everyone else has been too busy trying to stay afloat to fight back.",

Productivity in industries with mostly less-skilled workers rose by 20 percent while wages grew by 24 percent.\"\n\nI'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding Brooks or the relationship here, since he doesn't explain it, but the data he cites seems at first glance to indicate the opposite of his point: despite the fact that productivity in high-skilled industries increased by near double that of low-skill industries, their wages are increasing at nearly the same pace. If \"wages are still generally determined by skills and productivity,\" why aren't high-skilled workers' wages increasing at the same pace as their productivity?",

Mr Brooks' article suggests this is fine, because labour is a necessary asset to capital which capital invests in through higher salaries, benefits, etc. But in most cases this just isn't true: workers are capital's biggest expense, not its most valuable asset. The productivity of a worker is an asset, but the individual him or herself is simply the most convenient and likely most expensive way to get that. Workers will be and are discarded as an unnecessary expense the second it becomes possible to generate their productivity in any other way. \n\nIt's a system that works, and which produces wondrous economic growth, but if you're paid for your labour, don't think for a second that you yourself are valued because of it. Humans (especially American humans who want cares and high living standards) are more expensive to employ than computers, as evidenced by the relentless closure of plants and automation. \n\nOur political representatives must do more to recognise this than simply saying: 'Capitalism good!

And guess what, it works just fine for all of them. Despite higher taxes, their economies are humming right along and have done so for decades. \n\nIn Finland, for example, the total tax burden of an average employee is about 44%. Because Finnish taxation is progressive, the tax burden is even higher for higher earners. Yet, Finland's - free market! - economy is very strong.

This very manipulation results in the unequal productivity measures that Brooks thinks proves his point, though he is in fact involved in circular reasoning that he is to ignorant to detect.",

The losers suffer from a class conflict related to organizing work. Erik Sherman at Forbes explains: \"Labor participation began declining after a high of 67.3% in mid-2000.

Three key states suffering high deindustrialization (Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania) all voted for Trump.  \n\nThere is a kind of class conflict when it comes to the distribution of the economic surplus.  Will it go for healthcare, mass transportation, R&D to support alternative energy or tax breaks for the rich, the military budget, and luxury consumption?

Bernie is often too simplistic in his analysis and rhetoric, but I don't believe he's posed the problem in those words.  What he and Elizabeth Warren share is a belief in the failure of unrestrained capitalism and its warped approach to capital expansion, labor compensation, environmental destruction and short-term financial profit.  Warren has made clear that she believes in capitalism (much more than Bernie) is the preferred economic system if and only if it's properly controlled to restrain all the negative impacts that otherwise accrue in a rapacious capitalism--effects we see throughout our economy and society, the primary cause of increasing economic equality that itself is established as the major threat to democracy. Several prominent billionaires have recently said as much.\n\nIf Brooks believes there is no dramatic increase in class stratification and conflict, he's blind.  The middle class is disappearing. The terms he uses are the vague, fungible terms of right-wing sophists.  E.g., \"productivity\" which he never defines but which is the subject of data with conflicting interpretations.",

Bernie sees inequality and reverts back to the beginning of the 20th century when, indeed, capital had all the power and unions were suppressed.  Flash forward to today and unions are maligned and weak but not because capital is overwhelmingly strong.  Unions have withered for a whole host of reasons and this has undermined the capacity of the workers to earn their appropriate \"share of the pie\".\n\nBut there is another trend going on.  The nature of the economy is changing.  The manufacturing economy is progressively transformed into a knowledge economy.  In fact, repetitive, norms-based work is on its way out, with humans being replaced by computers, artificial intelligence or robots.  In this economy, highly educated professionals and the companies they work for keep increasing their earnings, while semi-skilled or unskilled labor is getting poorer every year.  \n\nOf course, political solutions can provide some relief, but this is not happening in the US.  Where Bernie is right is that corporations have used their influence on the political system and gained great benefits while the workers picked up the costs.  The raiding of pension funds, the eradication of defined-benefits pensions, and a whole host of provisions have tilted the power balance to the benefit of corporations and to the detriment of the workers.

Are we supposed to believe that the CEO of a star company has achieved a level of efficiency which greatly exceeds that of the hourly employees who produce the company's goods or services?\n\nTrump's tax cut, moreover, rewarded accumulated wealth, not increases in productivity.  This kind of redistribution of wealth does not signal the outbreak of class warfare, but it does expose a bias in favor of capital over labor.  If Brooks wants to demolish a false ideology, let him analyze  the bogus notion that tax cuts for wealthy business owners automatically stimulate economic growth.\n\nDavid has too much integrity to act as a shill for the business community, but this column nevertheless should be celebrated in boardrooms across the country.",

It is about a value set in transition.\n\nMy family is middle class with a modest but comfortable lifestyle. Homeownership, private colleges for our children, and fancy vacations are out of our reach. Fortunately conservative choices (and good luck) provided us with quality employer health insurance and adequate  savings. We are grateful for this security but also are aware that circumstances could change suddenly and dramatically. We absolutely support public funds as a security net. We have been paying social security taxes for decades, anticipating a monthly stipend and Medicare benefits when we retire or are unable to work. So when Senators Sanders and Warren speak about protecting the economic security of those of us with modest economic means, we listen. They make us feel appreciated for our lives\u2019 work and not feel like fools for not being more financially aggressive.",

When Sanders says the ultra rich have basically over the years tuned the system to their liking, he tells the truth.  We know that Big Money has always had a disproportional influence in our financial and legal system.  If you have a lot of money, you can make money from it and it alone.  \n\nIt works, because there are millions upon millions of people who need to buy things.  And when they do not have that need, the slick advertising industry can without fail convince them otherwise.  It is that sense -- of the multitudes buying things and services  -- that feeds the wealth to the wealthy -- disproportionately. \n\nBernie Sanders is merely, and I mean merely, saying that things will work better for everyone when that held wealth is partially tapped back into the system in order to try to put an end to poverty, and economic struggling.\n\nAbove all, Sanders understands democracy and abides by no other mechanism.  Elect him, and he will pursue very decent goals openly, legislatively, as a leader for all of us.  That's my take.",

You seem to suggest that workers in highly trained areas workers wages somewhat lagged their productivity gains while workers in lower trained areas exceeded productivity gains. That simply can't be true. Productivity since 1970 has continued to rise while wages, inflation adjusted So your facts don't align with reality. \n\nAnother hard fact is that when you compare each of the US generations from the Greatest to current, we are seeing for the first time, that the youngest generations simply are behind where their parents were. That's a fact. In some cases their wages might exceed their parents (adjusted for inflation), but the cost education, housing, child care, health care, etc. has so exceeded these income gains as to make them completely valueless. \n\nAs the stock market climbs about 29k - how many people actually participate in that wealth increase. Only 33% are invested in a 401k or IRA.  And even among those that are almost all of the gains are going to a small percentage. \n\nSocial Security now appears less stable (although there are some fixed for that)- made less secure by increasing debt through tax cuts that went primarily to the wealthy. Pensions are gone and with increasing costs, savings rates, particularly among the young but in all are way down. We're looking at multiple generations that won't retire with dignity.

Sanders and Warren discuss inequality because it's real and it's a massive problem that needs fixing.  The US was as powerful as ever, and there was a thriving middle class, during the 1950s and 1960s, when strong unions helped ensure decent wages and the top income tax reached as high as 90%.  The high wages kept the economy humming because people had money to spend..the government functioned because the taxes kept revenue coming in.   Ignoring these realities from the past does not help to solve our current income inequality problem.",

Every time we increase productivity for one person, we all thrive a little more, together.\u201d\n\nNonsense. From 1946 to 1981, the economy grew an annual average of 3.5%, but the top 1% earned between 5 and 10% of adjusted gross income. The tax code, i.e., public policy, intentionally curbed income concentration with high marginal and effective tax rates on the rich. \n\nFrom 1981 to 2018, the economy grew 2.7%, a massive drop off, while the 1% saw their incomes grow from 8% of the adjusted gross income to 22% by 2007 and around 20% of adjusted gross income today.  This massive reduction in growth is caused by the massive increase in income concentration. \n\nAll while our debt exploded from 32% of GDP in 1981 to 100% of GDP today. \n\nThe job of public policy is to make the lives of the governed people better. In the US, we do this with policies like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the minimum wage, overtime pay for hourly workers, child labor laws, laws prohibiting medical underwriting and benefit caps (aka, Obamacare), rural electrification, research, infrastructure, and even our relatively small social safety net.

Somehow Sanders's point about inequality between the middle class and the 1% morphs into a long dissertation about inequality between different groups of workers. I don't really care whether workers in \"superstar\" companies are doing better than workers in lagging companies. That has nothing to do with class war; workers are all in the same class. The class war that the 1% have been waging for the past 40 years is intended to squeeze as much wealth as possible out of the bottom 99%. What Sanders represents is that some of the 99% have finally started to fight back. The 1% have the money to buy the government but the 99% have the votes. That's what the 1% are scared of, and why they are trying to paint Sanders as a dangerous socialist who is going to ruin the country. The fact that the 1% is completely invisible in this column shows that it is pure obfuscation.\n\nAs for Trump's culture war, it is smoke and mirrors intended to obscure the class war that Trump is waging on behalf of his fellow billionaires. Shoveling $2 trillion at the rich and the giant corporations that already paid no taxes before the tax cut is the height of class war. The class war is real, it was started by the wealthy and they show no signs of giving it up. Therefore, the only question is: which side are you on?",

The only reason lower wages are rising is because we've had a uniquely sustained period of growth and finally, after nearly a decade, demand for labor has caused a slight uptick. Still, if the federal minimum wage had been indexed for inflation for the past several decades it would be well over $20/hour. I think it should be that high, and Sen. Sanders is only advocating for what he things he can accomplish, $15/hour.\n\n\"Second, wages are still generally determined by skills and productivity.\"\n...Sure, there's still a positive correlation between skills and wage, but if the whole income curve is that much lower than it was 50 years ago, it still means millions of Americans can't earn a living, afford healthcare, or afford education for their children. \n\nWake up, Mr. Brooks. You sound arrogant and out-of-touch.",

We are all in one way or another hyphenated-Americans. This has always been true, but what is different now is that, across the political spectrum, people tend to primarily identify with the adjective before the hyphen rather than with the noun, American. What divides us becomes more important than what divides us. We are not so much American as we are female, capitalist, anti-abortion, Black, pro-gun, gay, Christian, socialist, etc.\n\nDuring the Viet Nam War and the Civil Rights struggle, when America was more divided than it is now, we nonetheless all took pride in being American, as Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. If such an equivalent occurred today, instead of bringing us together, it would immediately become another opportunity to claim it discriminated against our pre-hyphen identity, should such not be \"the chosen one.\"\n\nWhy has this happened?

The main problem was that they were often very wrong about identifying the problems, and because they were uncompromising they condemned themselves, and often their parties, to oblivion. The best one can hope with Sanders is that he loses the nomination in terms even clearer than in 2016. That away we hopefully will not ever #whoevers to contend with. Worse, would be if does not get the nomination, but things drags to July and beyond, like in 2016. Even worse if he gets the nomination ... and looses the election. But the worst will be he win the nomination and the presidency. If that happens the uncompromising imaginary will hit reality like a brick wall, and  we might witness the destruction of the Democratic party and any hope of change for a generation.",

The work that Bernie has to do is not to ditch the class message but to make a compelling case that the white working-class will have a better future with a more just and equitable economy and, to get there, they need to build a coalition with Latinos and African Americans. If nothing else, the Democratic primary this time around is providing some real choice: even on the progressive wing, there's a choice between Sanders and Warren. Choosing Sanders is indicating that the old-fashioned white working-class plus racial minority model that elected Kennedy and Johnson still has some legs left and maybe even revitalized with young voters that gravitate toward Sanders. \n\nOh, talking about old-fashioned.

Exorbitant medical bills are the most common reason for bankruptcy in America today.  We have a perilous shortage of doctors, nurses and other caregivers in our system.  We pay the most for prescription drugs of anyone in the entire world and many go without filling lifesaving prescriptions due to cost.  A recent study showed that a third of our population regularly delays needed medical care due to cost.  Our life expectancy is shorter than every other country that has socialized medicine and, unlike those other countries, it has actually fallen for three consecutive years.  Medical outcomes are superior in countries with socialized medicine and medical mistakes far fewer.  Medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death in this country, after heart attacks and cancer.  Pharmaceutical companies and health insurance companies are sinfully rich.

That seemed crazy until I realized that our \"health care\" system is a FOR PROFIT industry.  While I don't believe that the majority of people who work or invest in this system directly wish my children harm, I do recognize that the same system that is producing an awful lot of chronically sick outcomes also profits more from those same outcomes.

It\u2019s not wrong per se for companies to be profitable, but for capitalism to work well they need to invest it back into their businesses, which creates jobs. Companies have stopped doing that. The only investing going on these days is VCs propping up WeWork and food delivery. \n\nPolicy makers need a plan for shaking corporate profits loose. \n\nI noodle on a scheme for requiring companies to employ a number of workers proportionate to profits with a minimum salary of say $60k. They can hire, fire, and assign them as they see fit, but a certain number has to be on the payroll. I think a large portion of those people would actually come up with some worthwhile contributions and may even be a net positive for the company. \n\nAre there a million ways a company could wiggle out of this? Yes. But some thought about corporate profits is warranted.",

What has happened in our economy that precludes such affordability today? 3. Huge numbers of Baby Boomers were raised in homes with one parent working outside the home and most of society had at least one day of rest. What has happened within our economy that has made the lives of working people so financially stressful? Unless the intellectuals start answering these questions to the working class, Mr. Brooks and his fellow conservative pundits should expect to see the rise of more Democratic Socialists.

They are not.  Both are aggregations of a variety of specific issues, for example, abortion, borders, and immigration for one, climate change and economic inequality for the other. People have a variety of opinions, and do not align themselves in one of two mutually exclusive ways.\n\nSanders is right in asserting that capital dominates labor, and Brooks is wrong in arguments as to why that is not so. Yes, low-wage workers are having their wages rise faster than higher-wage workers, because we recognize that capital does indeed dominate labor, and we have raised the minimum wage to mitigate that.\n\nBrooks productivity argument are similarly wrong. Productivity is a ratio of output to input, not merely input.  The gains from increasing productivity are shared unequally; those at the bottom get little, those at the top get a lot.  That\u2019s why capitalism increases inequality.\n\nNor, in this day and age, of various mixes of goodsand services, can we attribute worker productivity to the simple metrics of number of patients seen per day, or number of widgets assembled.

I live in a country with a robust, market driven economy that also has a significant social welfare state. The metrics tell the story of a society with a big, healthy middle class, and a relatively small portion of people living as poor or rich.  College tuition is more or less covered by the state, ensuring that virtually anyone that has the aptitude and motivation can pursue higher education. The public healthcare system covers 100% of the population and is arguably one of the best in the world. No one goes bankrupt due to illness, no one is denied coverage.

Tax laws, bankruptcy laws, credit rules, the judicial system and the police are, among others, all tools more or less in service to the wealthy. Without recognizing this and the fact that it sure feels like and assault, if not an all out war, to those at the bottom, there\u2019s no way to fix the problems short of radical change. As that\u2019s been the lesson of the past four decades, at least, radical change looks more and more like the only solution and one simply delayed by the machinations of the wealthy. They should support a fairer society in their own self-interest.",

And the very wealthy are consistently getting far wealthier while at the bottom some experience negative income growth. Doesn't that Piketty's graph clearly show that after 1970s the productivity rises much steeper than the wages? Which is great for capitalists. But not so great for workers. Capitalism is exploitation. Capitalist exploits natural, technological, and human resources to extract greater value (what Marx called surplus value) and make profit - for capitalism to be profitable workers must make more than they are paid for. So, they are indeed exploited. This issue can't be just explained away with the rise of productivity inequality between companies. And the only reason why we still don't have the class war here is that the culture-war conservatives treat the concept of class war pretty much like abortion, as something un-American. But THAT is changing with the younger generations, and you may be wrong that progressivism ALWAYS loses to conservativism. I suggest you step out of your ivory tower and go work somewhere in real life (like Barbara Echrenreich in Nickeled and Dimed) to get better apprehension of the 'managerial elite'. What Lind believes to be politically plausible may be shocking for the 'coastal cultural elite' is true now but it does not have to stay that way. Maybe we get some new counterculture '60s?",

            "comment_body": "\"Class-war progressivism always loses to culture-war conservatism\"\n\nI tend to agree with this, but this is precisely why Bernie Sanders's appeal is wider than the media likes to pretend. Sanders is no culture warrior. He's inclusive and socially progressive, but this is not what he foregrounds in his campaign. He speaks primarily in terms of economic justice and dignity for working people.\n\nSanders doesn't exaggerate when he says that almost half of all Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. We're entering our second decade of this being normal. For a whole lot of Americans downward mobility is reality. Midwestern swing voters may primarily vote their values, but at a certain point economic struggle begins to takes precedence. Voters have been screaming for change since '08 and '16; Sanders promises that, and whatever else one thinks of him, few doubt his authenticity. I think some mainstream commentators underestimate Sanders's appeal because they're thinking of it in terms of ideology, when Sanders frames his arguments in more digestible moral terms.\n\nAlso, I couldn't let this go:\n\n\"..over the long run people can\u2019t earn what they don\u2019t produce.\"\n\nIt's amazing that you're applying this to worker wages when the people whose pay is absolutely not commensurate to what they produce are CEO's and the executive class. CEO pay is insanely inflated, like to absurd degrees. It ain't the workers who are demanding too much. Check your blind spots, David.",

He calls it a reverse surplus recycling mechanism by which US deficits have financed the surplus of  China and the emerging markets, as mediated primarily by Wall Street.

They then use their power to get more wealth and so on. In the olden days they hired gangs of thugs called knights to extort money from the peasants and merchants. Today they hire politicians to pass laws that benefit them financially.\n\nThere seems to be a tipping point where this process becomes impossible to reverse. When inequality becomes bad enough, the country soon goes down the tubes. He gives several examples, e.g. the 18th century decline of the Dutch Republic. Chrystia Freeland used 14th century Venice to illustrate this process in a Times article, but history is replete with other examples.\n\nAccording to Phillips, the great success of America has been that before the tipping point was reached, something has always happened that reverses the flow of money upwards, e.g. the rise of unions, FDR's reforms.\n\nWill that happen this time?",

All capital is evil. \nPolicy enacted with this view will cripple the economy. Value added capital needs to be recognized and rewarded.

For example, Edward Lazear of Stanford University finds that between 1989 and 2017, productivity in mostly high-skill industries rose by roughly 34 percent and wages in those industries rose by 26 percent. Productivity in industries with mostly less-skilled workers rose by 20 percent while wages grew by 24 percent\".\n\nThis is complete nonsense. From 1989 to 2017 US economy (as measured by GDP) nearly tripled, while its population grew only by one third (from 247 millon to 325 million). That means that per capita GDP grew by the factor of 2.3 (in fact, according to some other data by 2.6) - that is 130% growth. How is that possible if workers' productivity supposedly rose by only 20 to 35% during that period? Assuming that the fraction of employed population did not change much, the average overall productivity of an American worker increased also by 130% from 1989 to 2017. Did his wage increase by the same amount? Of course not. Edward Lazear's numbers are funny numbers, cherry picked with a sole goal of making a point - in other words, they are meaningless propaganda. The reality is that productivity growth far outpaces the wage growth. Where does the balance go? Into the profits, of course. Is that \"class war\" enough for you?",

The problem with your argument is that you are not recognizing that people work in different circumstances  and economic contexts (location, industry cycle, competitive environment etc) for which they have limited control.  On top of that, people in different socioeconomic circumstances have very different opportunities and therefore very different earning and quality of life outcomes. What people are saying including Mr. Saunders is that no matter what the circumstances they are in, the distribution of wealth is extremely uneven, thus they view it as unfair. This is a valid and verifiable point. Wealth may never be distributed fairly under any economic or government system, but ideally, the governing system will provide an amount of wealth to people that is appropriate and somewhat commensurate with the nation\u2019s aggregate wealth.

And, having just finished Bernie Sander's book, I can tell you that Bernie isn't blaming capitalist's unless they are undermining our democracy. He saves his ire for corporations not paying taxes while they offshore workers and profits.",

Amazon's warehouse workers spend their days in conditions so awful they end up in ambulances because of heat stroke. And they don't make a living wage. The people who work in San Francisco as waiters, cleaners, clerks, etc., can't live within 2 hours of the city because they make so little. \n\nMeanwhile, Jeff Bezos, the Waltons, the Wall Street firms that took the country for billions of dollars without consequences, the tech company owners, all have more money than any capitalist in history ever imagined. No one has ever been this wealthy in the history of the world. Capitalism, as practiced in the US, is unburdened by anti-monopoly laws, taxes (in many cases), requirements to provide benefits or living wages, or even the sense of social responsibility that made early capitalists do things like build libraries and endow opera companies. Unbridled capitalism succeeds on the backs of everyone who keeps the companies going. \n\nWe didn't need Bernie Sanders to tell us this.",

Except this isn't a culture war.  It's about money and power, the very interests David Brooks has been fighting for all these years.",
