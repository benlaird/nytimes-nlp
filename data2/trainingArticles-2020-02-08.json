            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Making Brokers Go Broke Isn\u2019t the Solution, New York \nMy family has no idea where our next check will come from, because of a radical \nchange in rent laws, enacted out of the blue. By Ronnie Koenig Ms. Koenig is a \nwriter who covers real estate. When I heard the news about New York City \nregulators suddenly banning brokers from charging a fee to renters, I was \nshocked, and not in a good way. I scrolled through Twitter, reading the comments\n from some of the city\u2019s most prominent voices celebrating this as a victory \nover awful, unscrupulous middlemen, and my heart sank. To be clear, fees are the\n primary means through which the city\u2019s 25,000 licensed real estate brokers make\n money. And while they will still be able to collect fees from landlords (and \nrenters who hire a broker themselves), those in the industry widely expect the \ncompensation to be much smaller if this regulation stands. A lot of people think\n that all brokers are fat cats. And there are certainly some superstar agents \nwho rake in much more than the average. But many New York rental agents actually\n make between $45,000 to $60,000 a year. That\u2019s decidedly middle-class, \nespecially in this city. I personally know many people who have had bad \nexperiences with dishonest brokers. But there are few professions that are so \nwidely viewed as malicious \u2014 in everything from TV commercials to my kids\u2019 \ncartoons. But you can find bad apples in any profession. Not all brokers are \nshady, and we shouldn\u2019t be celebrating a change in policy that could ruin their \nlivelihoods. I should know; I\u2019m married to one of them. When Luke and I moved to\n New York City together in the late \u201990s we were two wide-eyed playwrights. We\u2019d\n met and fallen in love in the playwriting program at Ohio University before \nmaking our way to the city. We found temp jobs as well as a tiny one-bedroom \napartment in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, happily accepting all of the furniture from \nthe landlord\u2019s dead mother. While I worked as an assistant to the executive \nproducer of a soap opera, Luke put on the one white button-down shirt he owned \nand dutifully took the subway for over an hour each day to a job where he sat at\n a desk pushing paper, a soul-crushing job for someone with a personality like \nhis. He did it until an actor friend suggested that Luke take up what the friend\n was doing, real estate \u2014 a profession filled with creative types looking to \nsupport themselves while they made their art. It was a better fit. Luke craved \nmovement, and the job of renting apartments unchained him from the desk and \nallowed his long legs to traverse the city, looking for listings and meeting \nfellow New Yorkers. When we moved to Park Slope and, later, Windsor Terrace, he \nquickly became a well-known figure in our community. Standing at 6 feet 4 \ninches, he is very recognizable. From landlords to former customers to the \nowners of the butcher shop and the greengrocer, it is impossible to go anywhere \nwithout someone stopping Luke to have a quick conversation. Sometimes it is a \ncomplaint about a sticky landlord-tenant situation \u2014 which he always tries his \nbest to help to resolve \u2014 but more often than not it is a compliment. (\u201cThank \nyou for finding us our home.\u201d) For those celebrating the fact that they will \nnever again need to fork over thousands of dollars to someone who \u2014 they believe\n \u2014 just turns a key, I respectfully say, you don\u2019t know my husband\u2019s business. \nEven with the advent of apps like StreetEasy and Zillow, there are still hours \nand hours of hard work to be done: Obtaining the rental listings from landlords \nrequires years of legwork and relationship building, writing listing \ndescriptions (his often marked with the poetry of a writer who needs to put food\n on the table), vetting potential customers over the phone, arranging viewings \nand organizing open houses. He does it all well and unflinchingly, even if the \nresult in the end is zero pay because no deal is made. Of course, people often \nbalk at his fee, which he insists on calling a commission. He gently reminds \ncustomers that the fee is his only income. There are customers who view \napartments with rents that require a hefty income but suddenly cry poverty when \nit comes to paying for his work. They haggle, dig in their heels and often see \nmy husband as nothing but an obstacle to getting the expensive digs they want in\n a tony neighborhood. Many customers are cheerful, serious about moving and \nrespectful. But others see Luke\u2019s time as disposable, ghosting him after he \nmakes a late appointment, sometimes at the cost of being able to read to our \nchildren in the evening. Then, there are ones who show up late, holding \nsteaming-hot cups of name-brand coffee, ruining his schedule and those of his \nother clients. The New York City apartment broker who has been my partner in \nlife for over 20 years isn\u2019t a thief preying on the young people who come to New\n York City trying to make it, just as we did. He\u2019s a member of our Brooklyn \ncommunity, shoveling tenants\u2019 driveways, taking cleaning supplies from our own \nkitchen cabinets to ready an apartment for a showing, checking in on an aging, \nrecently widowed landlord who is currently housebound. \u201cLet\u2019s take a walk,\u201d he \nsaid gently to the man whose doors he has opened to so many people over the \nyears. But as of this weekend, my family has no idea where our next check will \ncome from because of this unannounced government policy enacted out of the blue \nthat has left us \u2014 and many other New York families \u2014 blindsided.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Hidden Depression Trump Isn\u2019t Helping The economy\n may get the president re-elected, but not everyone is sharing in its strength. \nBy Nicholas Kristof Opinion Columnist President Trump declared in his State of \nthe Union address that \u201cour economy is the best it has ever been.\u201d Put aside the\n Trumpian hyperbole, and it\u2019s true that the economy is strong \u2014 and that this is\n critical to Trump\u2019s chances for re-election. The Obama recovery has continued \nunder Trump, with the stock market surging and corporate profits swelling. Just \nlast month, employers added 225,000 jobs. Private wealth owned by American \nhouseholds and nonprofits has soared just since 2000 by the equivalent of more \nthan $800,000 per household, according to Federal Reserve data. Wow! I feel \nricher already. Yet we live in two Americas, and there\u2019s another side of the \ncountry that Trump didn\u2019t mention \u2014 one that helped elect him but that he has \nneglected since. In the other America, suicide rates are at a record high in the\n post-World War II era, and more Americans die every two weeks from drugs, \nalcohol and suicide \u2014 \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d \u2014 than died in 18 years of war in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. These deaths are symptoms of a larger economic malaise for\n working-class Americans that predates Trump. It\u2019s not his fault, but neither \nhas he tried seriously to address it; in some ways, especially in health care, \nhe has worsened it. Important new research finds that 20 million Americans, \nparticularly those with low levels of education, describe all 30 of the last 30 \ndays as \u201cbad mental health days.\u201d \u201cThese men and women report in effect that \nevery day of life is a bad day,\u201d said David G. Blanchflower, a Dartmouth \neconomist who conducted the research. Blanchflower noted that self-reported \nhappiness in America has continued to fall. Low-income Americans also report \nlevels of physical pain impairing their lives that are higher than reported by \nwealthier Americans, and far higher than in other advanced countries. One-third \nof Americans say that they have been in pain \u201coften\u201d or \u201cvery often\u201d in the last\n four weeks. Some of the pain probably results from a lack of universal health \ncare. Millions of Americans endure constant toothaches in a way that doesn\u2019t \nhappen in our peer countries. In effect, we have a bifurcated economy, marked by\n prosperity for millions of Americans and by a Social Great Depression for \nmillions of others. It\u2019s strange to make a comparison to the Great Depression, \nfor output is surging. But consider the effect on mortality: Even during the \nGreat Depression, life expectancy rose strongly, while in three of the last four\n years it fell because of deaths of despair. We\u2019re used to thinking of a \ndepression as geographic, but this one is demographic. Working-class Americans, \noften defined as those without a college degree, are caught in a dust bowl. \u201cThe\n crisis is almost invisible for those with a college degree,\u201d noted Anne Case, a\n Princeton economist who is an author, with her husband, fellow-economist Angus \nDeaton, of an excellent book coming out this spring about deaths of despair. It \nis these working-class Americans, white and black alike, who have seen earnings \ncollapse, family structure disintegrate and mortality climb. These Americans are\n earning less on average, adjusted for inflation, than their counterparts back \nin the 1970s. \u201cOur story of deaths of despair is essentially a long-run account \nof destruction of the working class,\u201d Deaton said. In the 1930s, President \nFranklin Roosevelt worked hard to address the Depression with the New Deal. This\n time, Trump in some ways has exacerbated the pain \u2014 such as by chipping away at\n access to health care. Some 400,000 children have lost health insurance under \nTrump. It\u2019s true that unemployment has dropped and that workers at the bottom \nare enjoying some of the largest wage gains, a pattern that is drawing some \npeople back into the labor force. That\u2019s significant and welcome (albeit the \nwage gains result partly from local increases in the minimum wage and the \neconomic strength partly from trillion-dollar deficits). But Case says that even\n so, almost half of Americans aged 25 and over with only a high school diploma \nare no longer in the labor force. Meanwhile, the central fact of America today \nis not its economic vigor but its profound inequity. I noted that private wealth\n has increased by $800,000 per household. It\u2019s similarly true that whenever Jeff\n Bezos walks into a room, average wealth there shoots up so that each person \nbecomes, on average, a billionaire. Interesting, but not very meaningful. * Last\n week, I told how U.S. Bank had fired two employees who had used $20 of their \nown money to help a stranded customer. Within hours of the column going online, \nI received a call from the bank\u2019s C.E.O., Andrew Cecere, who previously wouldn\u2019t\n return my calls, apologizing and saying that he would correct the situation. \nHere\u2019s an update. Abigail Gilbert, the manager who was fired, confirms that she \nwill return to her old job. Cecere says the bank is talking with Emily James, \nthe other fired employee, about a job with more responsibility and higher pay; \nshe is also discussing jobs with other companies. This all sounds promising, but\n indignant columns are not a scalable solution to the problem of labor \ninjustices. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the \neditor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Donald Trump Theory of Bernie Sanders What better\n foe for the president than his alter ego? By Frank Bruni Opinion Columnist A \nRepublican friend of mine rolled his eyes (and maybe even licked his chops) at \nthe possibility that Democrats would nominate Bernie Sanders. \u201cHave they learned\n nothing from Jeremy Corbyn?\u201d he asked. \u201cMaybe not,\u201d I acknowledged. \u201cBut \nthey\u2019ve learned a lot from Donald Trump.\u201d Corbyn, of course, led the Labour \nParty in Britain to a whopping defeat by Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. He\n lost for many reasons, but his leftist politics were in the mix. He calls \nhimself, well, a democratic socialist. I needn\u2019t provide such a primer on Trump.\n But I should point out that while he didn\u2019t initially command broad support \nwithin his party, the backers he did have were loud and proud to the point of \nfanaticism (and remain so). He described the country as a failing experiment and\n promised to explode the status quo. He and his followers practiced (and aced) \nabsolutism: You stood with or against them \u2014 there was no squishy in between \u2014 \nand America could be sorted neatly into villains and victims. He dispensed with \nthe usual political etiquette, chafed against the ill-fitting political party in\n which he\u2019d garbed his ambitions and insisted that the system was rigged. Sound \nlike any senator from Vermont you know? You can analyze Sanders and assess his \nprospects in terms of how liberal many of his positions are: the end of private \nhealth insurance, the dismantling of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nagency, free tuition at public colleges regardless of a student\u2019s economic \ncircumstances. By that yardstick he\u2019s Corbyn, and, in my view, a hell of a \ngeneral-election risk. Or you can focus on his irascibility, his grandiosity and\n the bellicosity of his believers. Through this lens he\u2019s Trump. And what better\n way to topple the current president than with his ideologically inverted alter \nego? That\u2019s a theory of the case \u2014 fight fury with fury, one messiah with \nanother \u2014 that I hear frequently as Sanders cements his front-runner status in \nthe Democratic primary and as Democrats, desperate to defeat Trump, wrestle with\n the wisdom or folly of giving Sanders that assignment. He essentially tied Pete\n Buttigieg in the Iowa caucuses and is slightly favored to win the primary on \nTuesday in New Hampshire, where he trounced Hillary Clinton four years ago. He \nleads Buttigieg by significant margins in polls in the two states, Nevada and \nthen South Carolina, that follow it. Meanwhile, it\u2019s hard to see how Elizabeth \nWarren pulls ahead of him, and Joe Biden is struggling to overcome a humiliating\n fourth-place finish in Iowa. That makes Sanders as strong a bet as any other \ncandidate to nab the Democratic nomination. The reasons for his success include \nhis similarities to Trump, but don\u2019t get me wrong: There\u2019s no alignment of \nagendas among the two of them, no common set of political values and no moral \nequivalence \u2014 not remotely. I\u2019ve read too much journalism that comes too close \nto suggesting that they\u2019re versions of the same old white guy and have the same \nsloppiness with facts, talent for bullying and instinct for demagogy. Trump is a\n tyrant all his own. But Sanders is a populist of the left as surely as Trump is\n a populist of the right, with a familiar distaste for compromise and a \ncomparable appeal to Americans outraged or disgusted by politics as usual and by\n the usual politicians. He, like Trump, breaks the mold and defies the laws of \npolitical gravity: He had a heart attack last fall, at the age of 78, and it \ndidn\u2019t scare away voters or slow his stride. While Trump claims leadership of \u201ca\n movement the likes of which the world has never seen,\u201d Sanders spearheads a \n\u201crevolution,\u201d to be brought about by \u201cthe most unprecedented campaign in the \nmodern history of this country.\u201d And aspects of his pitch \u2014 on trade, for \nexample \u2014 resonate with the blue-collar workers in the Rust Belt who were \nimportant to Trump\u2019s election. While some of Trump\u2019s advisers believe that \nSanders would be an easily caricatured foil, others believe that he could be \ntrouble. Look closely and you see the spirit and lessons of Trump all over the \nDemocratic primary and the Democratic Party. You see it in the Biden campaign\u2019s \nquestioning of the legitimacy of the Iowa results days before The Times \ndiscovered and reported on specific irregularities. You see it in Mike \nBloomberg\u2019s merciless trolling of Trump with commercials that make him look fat \nand unhinged, and statements that would be shockingly juvenile but for their \nmimicry of Trump\u2019s taunts. Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, \nrecently called the president \u201ca pathological liar who lies about everything: \nhis fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan.\u201d You see it Nancy Pelosi\u2019s \ntheatrical ripping up of her copy of Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. And you\n see it in the dive bar in Iowa where, on the eve of the caucuses, one Sanders \nsupporter led others in a crude call-and-response, as recounted by Shawn \nMcCreesh in Rolling Stone. The supporter would say the F word, and everyone \nwould answer \u201cBiden!\u201d or \u201cWarren!\u201d or such. Is this the rowdy road to a \nDemocratic victory in November 2020? My brain and gut both say no, and those who\n think so \u2014 and who designate Sanders as the one to lead the stampede \u2014 overlook\n several dynamics, starting with policy. Polling shows that most Americans \ndislike a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan that eliminates private insurance, as \nSanders\u2019s signature proposal does. Polling also shows that most Americans \nwouldn\u2019t want that plan to cover undocumented immigrants. Sanders\u2019s covers them.\n And Trump is already testing his attack on that front. \u201cIf you believe that we \nshould defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and \npass legislation to prohibit free government health care for illegal aliens,\u201d he\n said in the address that Pelosi shredded. He also vowed that he would \u201cnever \nlet socialism destroy American health care.\u201d The idea that Sanders would be the \nstrongest nominee is challenged by the most recent midterms, when the candidates\n who helped the Democrats gain 40 seats in the House and recapture control of it\n weren\u2019t ideologically pure soldiers of the revolution. They struck less \nmilitant, more nuanced notes, as the veteran Democratic strategist James \nCarville observed a few days ago in a lament about Sanders\u2019s rise. He told Vox\u2019s\n Sean Illing that in 2018, \u201cwe did great: We talked about everything we needed \nto talk about and we won. And now it\u2019s like we\u2019re losing our damn minds.\u201d On \nMSNBC he said he was \u201cscared to death\u201d that Democrats would blow the 2020 \nelection. Turnout in the Iowa caucuses was hardly reassuring. It appears that \nabout 170,000 Iowans participated \u2014 considerably fewer than in 2008, when \n240,000 people took part. That contradicts Sanders\u2019s and his followers\u2019 \ncontention that his candidacy would rouse legions of dormant and first-time \nvoters. As for the argument that Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat proves the inefficacy \nof an establishment or center-left nominee, well, Clinton won the popular vote \nby about three million ballots and lost the Electoral College by only about \n77,000, despite Russia, despite James Comey, despite a relentless focus on her \nemails and despite her own uniquely heavy political baggage. Subtract all of \nthat and you get a winner \u2014 a winner who looks nothing like Bernie Sanders. But \nwhen you go back exactly four years ago, you\u2019re also reminded that Trump was \ncausing utter panic among his party\u2019s standard-bearers, who were convinced that \nnominating him would be akin to forfeiting the election. He was too \nidiosyncratic, too provocative \u2014 too much. Any responsible political analyst \ncould see it. And almost every responsible political analyst saw it wrong.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Don Strikes Back An enraged and ebullient Trump \nups the body count. By Maureen Dowd Opinion Columnist Democrats: The only thing \nyou have to fear is Trump himself. You should be quaking. Our unhinged monarch \nhad a very good week and your party had a very bad week \u2014 and that\u2019s no B.S. A \nlot of you told me, with expletives, that while you were watching President \nTrump\u2019s carnival-barking this past week, you were thinking, \u201cWe\u2019re going to \nfreaking lose.\u201d Trump hollowed out the hallowed, Apprenticing one of \nWashington\u2019s most august traditions on Tuesday night, showing in the State of \nthe Union how he has figured out how to use the levers of the presidency to \namplify his flair for the dramatic. There has always been political theater; now\n there\u2019s Trump political theater, as he perfects the black art of turning \nDemocrats into mincemeat. What could be more flamboyantly offensive than the \nanti-bullying advocate, Melania, hanging a Presidential Medal of Freedom around \nthe neck of one of the biggest bullies and hate preachers of all time, Rush \nLimbaugh? Talk about the bully pulpit. The president even finally managed to \nsend his classy nemesis, Nancy Pelosi, over the edge, as she became so agitated \nthat she was driven to Trumpian tactics to rebut his lies. The acquittal put an \nexclamation point on two facts: Trump has subsumed the Republican Party, except \nfor the sole Republican lawmaker whose base would not kill him if he voted to \nthrow the president out of office. And he has forged one of the most cynical and\n darkly productive alliances of all time with the poker-faced Mitch McConnell, \nsending his personal approval rating to an all-time high. Iowa was a master \nclass in Democratic dysfunction. The disarray kicked off the Saturday before the\n vote when the all-important Des Moines Register poll crashed and burned. After \nthat, campaign staffers on the ground began spinning, pushing their own \nnarratives based on internal polls, and the press corps became a dog chasing its\n own tail. On the night of the vote, I went to a high school on the edge of Des \nMoines to watch Iowans caucus. The caucuses have always been screwy under the \nrubric of quaint, with people offering chocolates for votes and doing coin \ntosses to make final decisions. But after I watched a kerfuffle, where a woman \nin a pajama outfit threw a fit when her vote somehow got moved from Biden to \nButtigieg, things seemed sketchier than ever. That was just the start of Iowa\u2019s \nauto-da-f\u00e9. Candidates jumped on planes to get out of dodgy Dodge, leaving \nlower-level staffers and the press corps in a cocktail party of confusion at the\n lobby bar at the Des Moines Marriott. As one campaign staffer told New York \nmagazine\u2019s Olivia Nuzzi as he disappeared into the freezing cold Iowa night, the\n only thing left was to get soused and give himself over to concupiscence. By \nthe time I got to New Hampshire, the Democratic hysteria was rising \u2014 and a \nfaltering Joe Biden disappeared in a crisis cloud \u2014 while internecine class war \nwas intensifying. Pete Buttigieg was pre-declaring victory, spurring Sanders \nsupporters to dub him \u201cMayor Cheat\u201d on Twitter. Bernie Sanders spoke on Friday \nmorning, tying Buttigieg to Wall Street and urging Democrats to decide if they \nwere on the side of the working class or greed, \u201cwhere billionaires control not \nonly our economy, but our political life.\u201d #PetesBillionaires began trending on \nTwitter. James Carville, en route to New Hampshire with his Mardi Gras beads to \ncampaign for Michael Bennet, went on viral rants about being \u201cscared to death\u201d \nfor his party as it lurched toward the far left. \u201cLet\u2019s get relevant here, \npeople, for sure,\u201d he said on MSNBC, adding, \u201cDo we want to be an ideological \ncult?\u201d As the Republicans stuck together, ruled by fear and self-interest, the \nDemocrats shattered apart. \u201cDonald Trump is narrowcasting to African-Americans \nand Latinos with his Super Bowl ad and at the State of the Union, and the \neconomy\u2019s doing well, and meanwhile we\u2019re fiddling around with a Socialist and \nEncyclopedia Brown,\u201d moaned one top Democrat on the Hill. Democrats from \nCongress to Los Angeles began whispering hopefully about Michael Bloomberg. \n\u201cThere seems to be a groundswell of support, mostly based on the fact that he\u2019ll\n spend whatever it takes and fight just as dirty as Trump \u2014 with more \nresources,\u201d said David Israel, a writer in Hollywood. Just as when he made his \nvery imperfect call to the Ukrainian president the day after Robert Mueller \ntestified, Trump began acting out right after his acquittal. He launched a \nrevenge mission, accusing Pelosi of a Xerox felony. He said ominously about the \nPelosi rip heard around the world: \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s an official document. \nYou\u2019re not allowed. It\u2019s illegal what she did. She broke the law.\u201d Gordon \nSondland, the bumbling ambassador to the European Union who tried to help Trump \nseal his dirty deal but gave oomph to the quid-pro-quo argument, was given the \nboot. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the national security official who testified \nagainst Trump in the impeachment hearings, and his twin brother were perp-walked\n out of the White House complex Friday. (They needed to make sure they had their\n man.) \u201cThe most powerful man in the world \u2014 buoyed by the silent, the pliable \nand the complicit \u2014 has decided to exact revenge,\u201d said David Pressman, \nVindman\u2019s lawyer. Democrats should be scared to death watching the president \nplay to thuggish type, re-enacting the chilling final payback scenes of \u201cThe \nGodfather,\u201d when Michael Corleone took out all his enemies. It\u2019s not business. \nIt\u2019s strictly personal. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of \nletters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Lonely Are the Brave With his impeachment vote, Mitt \nRomney vindicates an American ideal. By Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist To honor\n the memory of Kirk Douglas, who died this week at 103, I watched \u201cLonely Are \nthe Brave\u201d on Thursday night. The 1962 classic is about a 20th-century cowboy at\n mortal odds with modern life \u2014 a roaming spirit who won\u2019t be stopped by wire \nfences, prison bars, search helicopters or sadistic lawmen. The men and women in\n the film are short on talk, but strong in character. In other words, the exact \nopposite of our politicians today. It was good to see \u201cLonely Are the Brave\u201d at \na moment when the closest Washington had to the film\u2019s hero was Mitt Romney, \nwho, alone among Republicans, voted to convict and remove President Trump from \noffice for abuse of power. Mitt? Was this the same man who denounced Donald \nTrump as a \u201ccon man\u201d in March of 2016 and then auditioned to be his secretary of\n state that November? Who, as governor of Massachusetts, pioneered a version of \nObamacare in 2006 only to denounce Obamacare when he ran for president in 2012? \nWho by turns has called himself a \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d Republican, as \nwell as a \u201cseverely conservative\u201d one? One and the same. Yet the senator from \nUtah finally seems to have found the hill he\u2019s willing to die on. It\u2019s courage \nthat demands respect. I\u2019ve been reading and rereading Romney\u2019s moving and \nmasterly Senate floor speech on Wednesday, in which he explained his vote. \u201cI \nwill only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of \nAmericans who look at the record of this trial,\u201d he said in his peroration. \n\u201cThey will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what \nthe president did was wrong, grievously wrong.\u201d The central theme of Romney\u2019s \naddress is obligation: the things to which we are bound, and those to which we \nare not. Romney says, and clearly believes, that he is bound by the \nConstitution, his oath to God, the evidence, his conscience and the judgment of \nhistory. What doesn\u2019t bind him: loyalty to president and party, the opinions of \nhis constituents, the need to \u201cstand with the team\u201d or \u2014 most specious of all \u2014 \nthe idea that, whatever the facts, the Senate is obliged to acquit Trump so that\n voters can render their own verdict in November. Yet there is no constitutional\n case to leave to voters decisions that belong only to Congress \u2014 the dark road \nMitch McConnell went down when he denied Judge Merrick Garland a confirmation \nhearing in 2016, on the theory that \u201cthe American people\u201d should choose Justice \nAntonin Scalia\u2019s replacement. The whole concept of small-r republicanism rests \non the idea that self-government works only when public opinion is filtered \nthrough multiple institutions and wiser heads, not merely flushed through \nCongress like sewage in a drain. Conservatives used to believe this, just as \nthey used to believe that the branches of government were coequal; that \npolitical dirty tricks should never be normalized; that embattled allies must \nnot be enlisted in such tricks; that, as Judge Laurence Silberman once said, \n\u201cThe most heinous act in which a democratic government can engage is to use its \nlaw enforcement machinery for political ends\u201d; that innocence isn\u2019t established \nby the failure to get away with the intended crime; and that acquittal isn\u2019t \nvindication. Among the things now permanently lost to Republicans amid their \nsupposed victory in the impeachment saga is the hope of having a leg to stand on\n when, in the fullness of time, a future Democratic president behaves toward \nthem exactly the way Trump behaved last year. Also lost: that once deeply held \nAmerican ideal that the person who says \u201cno\u201d when everyone else says \u201cyes\u201d (or \nvice versa) doesn\u2019t defy democracy, but ennobles it. The right-wing \nvituperations descending on Romney, directed by the president and amplified \nthrough his media minions, are no better than the left\u2019s cancel-culture \nwarriors, seeking to wreck the lives of anyone who falls short of expectations \nor doesn\u2019t toe the ideological line. To his credit, Romney knew this would come:\n Like Kirk Douglas\u2019s cowboy in \u201cLonely Are the Brave,\u201d nobody breaks out of \nprison, physical or ideological, without expecting a posse. \u201cI\u2019m sure to hear \nabuse from the president and his supporters,\u201d Romney predicted, knowing Trump \nnever disappoints the meanest expectations. But even Romney\u2019s bitterest critics,\n left and right, ought to give him this: He voted without regard for personal \nadvantage, without fear of partisan obloquy, and without an eye on the easy way \nout \u2014 all for the sake of his own self-respect. The country would be a better \nplace today if more people in positions of authority acted similarly. A line \nfrequently (if probably erroneously) attributed to Andrew Jackson is that \u201cone \nman with courage makes a majority.\u201d What happened in the Senate this week shows \nhow wrong that line usually is. But if Mitt Romney\u2019s lonely vote proves \nanything, it\u2019s that political courage makes a patriot.  The Times is committed \nto publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
