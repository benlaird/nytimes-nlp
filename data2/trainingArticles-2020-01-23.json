Nontraditional Nigerian churches are safe spaces for young Christians\n \u2014 if they aren\u2019t L.G.B.T.Q. By Nelson C.J. Mr. C.J. is a writer and curator. \nLAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 Services at the Tribe Lagos church in Nigeria are held in a \nchic, urbane cafe resembling many others like it in the area: a long, fairly \nspacious room with stark white walls and light casings made from woven raffia \npalms. On a recent Sunday morning, around 80 congregants in their 20s and 30s \nbegan trickling in for the 9 o\u2019clock meeting, per usual. Their fashion choices \nwere hip, personalized and elaborately conceived \u2014 bright vintage tees paired \nwith baggy, gently rolled-up jeans; colorfully patterned dresses flowing above \nhigh-rise sneakers. There was an undeniable metropolitan vibe suggesting an \nuncontested comfort in their skins. It was my first visit to the Tribe, having \nlearned of it through friends who are regular attendees and speak highly of its \nimpact on their lives for its nontraditional approaches. I was curious to see if\n it might have the same effect on me, a queer millennial in search of fellowship\n in a country where homophobia has been written into law. I observed an opening \nprayer, followed by musical performances by the church band. Everyone seemed to \nknow each other, and the service moved freely from one form to the next \u2014 at \ntimes it could have passed for an open-mic session or karaoke among friends. The\n casual and collaborative atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the Nigerian \nchurches I grew up in, where authority is concentrated at the altar. Here at the\n Tribe, everyone seemed to be equal in their participation; even the pastors \ncould easily be mistaken for congregants. The Tribe began in 2017 as a weekly \nevent called \u201cCoffee and Conversations,\u201d with the intent of having \u201cobjective \nconversations around spirituality,\u201d according to its founder and pastor, \nFerdinand Adimefe. Like many young Nigerians, Mr. Adimefe, 34, was conflicted \nabout the conservative leanings within Christianity that dominate the country\u2019s \nculture and laws. \u201cThe approach of the church didn\u2019t seem to have answers to \nmodern problems,\u201d he told me during an hourlong chat, \u201cor didn\u2019t even seem \nprepared to take up the questions\u201d his generation seemed to be asking. He \ndecided to take an indeterminate break from his Pentecostal church to question \nits beliefs and create a new narrative he felt needed to emerge within \nChristianity. The Tribe has gained a steady following and grown to serve more \nthan 150 members in Lagos and a smaller branch in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital. The \ncommunity is part of a larger wave, beginning in the early 2000s, of more \nprogressive Nigerian Pentecostal churches led by young people that have risen up\n to fill the space conservative churches have left unexplored. Tapping into a \ngeneration\u2019s concerns about mental health, relationships, identity, sexuality \nand finances, these organizations ostensibly offer their congregants a friendly \nspace to unpack whatever they might be dealing with alongside the teachings of \nGod. Like many queer people, my most defining contact with homophobia began at \nchurch. Though I was raised Catholic, at 15, I switched to a traditional \nPentecostal church when I went to live with my older sister, who lived in a \ndifferent Nigerian state, following the death of my mother. The experience was \nprofoundly dispiriting. I was subjected to conversion therapy after my family \nfound messages I\u2019d shared with my partner at the time, and it left me physically\n and emotionally scarred in ways I am still processing four years later. I \nstopped actively participating in my church\u2019s youth activities because it seemed\n dishonest and impossible for me to reject who I am and worship God at the same \ntime. Prayer was used against my sexuality, and my personhood. But faith dies \nhard. And I find that I am still drawn to church culture, particularly the \nsinging and the small pockets of community it can provide. I have also always \nlived by the certainty of a higher being who affords me a spiritual footing. I \nstill believe in God, or the faintest notion of its existence, and continue to \nseek out relatively healthier places of worship. I first encountered a \nnontraditional place of worship when I visited Harvesters, another youth-\noriented church that was founded in 2003, as a 19-year-old in search of a \ndeparture from my traditional Christian upbringing. I was able to attend \nservices there only a couple of times \u2014 the distance from my home makes it \ndifficult \u2014 though I appreciated the practical and objective conversations aimed\n at addressing the issues of the young congregants. As a queer person, the \nexistence of spaces like Harvesters and Te Tribe, which operate on the basis of \na more open-minded kind of love and acceptance, can be refreshing. But for all \nof the openness these new wave churches profess, the conversations around \nqueerness have often played out via correctional undertones and are sometimes \navoided all together. When I\u2019ve tried talking about issues specific to being \nqueer with other L.G.B.T.Q. people who attend these services, this avoidance \nseems to be a key motivating factor in their decision to keep returning. They \ncan worship without being subjected to hateful sermons condemning homosexuality.\n But how does silence equal equality? Outside places of worship, queer Nigerians\n are frequently subjected to violent attacks, blackmail, extortion, \nindiscriminate arrests and public ostracism. It\u2019s risky to report these \ninjustices to the police, who have openly advised queer people to leave the \ncountry or risk prosecution. When I asked Mr. Adimefe about the Tribe\u2019s stance \non L.G.B.T.Q. issues, I learned that while the church will not exclude queer \npeople or pray against them, he encourages his congregants to be open to the \npossibilities of becoming straight when they meet with teachings from the Bible.\n \u201cAcceptance is not an endorsement,\u201d he said. This contradiction has posed a \nconundrum for me. A space like the Tribe could serve as an occasional refuge \nwhere my existence as a queer person isn\u2019t in constant negotiation, at least on \nits surface. But it\u2019s not a community I can honestly and completely call my own.\n Friendships and relationships are formed here, and I want to be a part of it. \nBut the corrective bent of the Tribe floats over my head like a bad cloud. After\n I left that Sunday service with the Tribe and my conversation with Mr. Adimefe,\n I was reminded yet again of the privileges even the most progressive Nigerian \nchurches continue to afford heteronormative identities. Such churches might \nprovide safer spaces for young Nigerians, but they come with limits for young \nChristians who are queer. And in this way, they are one and the same with the \nconservative churches from which they try to distinguish themselves. It\u2019s just a\n more benevolent form of homophobia. I still haven\u2019t found a fellowship where I \ncan truly be myself \u2014 but my faith in such a possibility hasn\u2019t been shaken yet.\n Nelson C.J.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by When Will Companies Finally Step Up to Fight Climate \nChange? Microsoft and BlackRock have made positive moves. But there\u2019s still a \nlot of money to be made in green tech. By Kara Swisher Ms. Swisher covers \ntechnology and is a contributing opinion writer. Is a \u201cdecarbonized\u201d future \npossible? That\u2019s what Microsoft promised it would aim for when it pledged this \nweek to go carbon negative by 2030. It added that it would attempt by 2050 to \n\u201cremove from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted either \ndirectly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975.\u201d Also on \ndeck: a $1 billion climate innovation fund. Like a lot of other top tech \ncompanies, most of which have done this kind of thing as merely a press release,\n Microsoft had previously said it would eventually be carbon neutral, largely by\n reducing emissions and paying for carbon offsets. But with ever more evidence \nof devastating climate change, and a feeling that carbon neutrality is the least\n that big companies should do, Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, doubled down, \nnoting that \u201cneutral is not enough to address the world\u2019s needs.\u201d The Microsoft \nannouncement was preceded by a more surprising one from BlackRock, the world\u2019s \nlargest asset manager, with $7 trillion under its management. Larry Fink, the \nchief executive, said in his annual letter to investors that climate change \nwould be a prime focus of the company\u2019s investment decisions. Despite the fact \nthat BlackRock continues to be a major investor in coal, oil and gas companies, \nhe said that the company would begin to step away from certain carbon \ninvestments. \u201cThe evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess \ncore assumptions about modern finance,\u201d he wrote, explaining that climate change\n is the top concern that investors raise with BlackRock. \u201cIn the near future \u2014 \nand sooner than most anticipate \u2014 there will be a significant reallocation of \ncapital.\u201d Indeed, while there was a lot of virtue-signaling in the letter that \ndescribed what a dystopian future of floods and extreme heat meant for \ninvesting, Mr. Fink was actually appealing to the greatest motivators of all \ntime: capitalism and greed. That\u2019s exactly why I wrote in a column at the start \nof the new year, that \u201cI think the world\u2019s first trillionaire will be a green-\ntech entrepreneur.\u201d That\u2019s trillionaire, with a T. But in the same way that tech\n ignores the benefits of diversity \u2014 which many studies have shown to be a key \nsignal of a successful organization \u2014 it continues to ignore the benefits of \ngreen tech. The amount of investment and innovation aimed at green technology \nremains stubbornly low compared with other tech sectors; most of the high-\nprofile investments come from the likes of Bill Gates and Elon Musk. I still do \nnot get why Silicon Valley largely scorns green tech \u2014 except that perhaps it is\n a lot harder to get right than offering a new app in which teenagers can do \ndance-offs. It\u2019s a big mistake. Recent reports outline a multitrillion-dollar \nopportunity in the years ahead in a variety of areas, including battery storage,\n urban mobility, renewables, software and artificial intelligence to help us \nunderstand climate data, the food production ecosystem and even the way we \nconstruct our buildings, which is a surprisingly major contributor to the \ngreenhouse-gas problem. So, too, fashion sustainability, since clothing has a \nlife cycle of waste. With so many roads to pursue, it\u2019s been vexing to see that \na lot of the focus from tech companies has been around direct air-capture of \ncarbon \u2014 a kind of Ghostbusters approach of sucking up the baddies. That\u2019s all \nwell and good, but it only ameliorates the problem with creative cleaning-up \nrather than by solving it at the source. The clean energy opportunities are \nlegion, especially as cities and states show more commitment to fighting climate\n change than the Trump administration. Localities are setting energy targets for\n many services they deliver, all of which will require vendors with creative \nsolutions. And as governments increase their support for electric vehicles, \nwhich could make up a significant part of passenger car sales in the next 20 \nyears, there is a greater demand for innovation in batteries and storage, as \nwell as in charging solutions that are faster and more efficient. There is some \npositive movement in the private sector. One of the more interesting efforts is \naround what is called a \u201ccircular economy\u201d \u2014 essentially recycling on steroids \nin which products are designed at the outset never to be thrown in a landfill. \nBlackRock, in fact, recently started the BGF Circular Economy Fund, with the \nEllen MacArthur Foundation, to scope out start-ups that help big brands think \ndifferently about their products. (Its $20 million investment is tiny, but it\u2019s \nsomething.) That topic is coming up more frequently with the most unexpected of \nleaders. For example, in a recent meeting I had with the Starbucks chief \nexecutive, Kevin Johnson (who was a longtime Microsoft executive), the main line\n of discussion was around tech solutions to climate change. While banning \nplastic straws is all well and good, Mr. Johnson sees a bigger role in \nbolstering his company\u2019s bottom line by focusing on sustainability (and also on \nthe health of his workers). Of course, none of this makes a difference unless \nalternative low- and no-carbon energy solutions are pushed forward over oil and \ngas. In this arena, the United States and Europe lag in investment and \ninnovation far behind China, which has a staggering lead in solar photovoltaic \nmodule production and also a big head start in other renewable technologies, \nincluding hydropower and lithium-ion batteries. (Lithium, by the way, is often \nreferred to as the \u201cwhite petroleum.\u201d) So, this week at the economic forum in \nDavos, Switzerland, where a big focus was on the existential threat to humanity \nposed by climate change, it was more than depressing to see the climate change \ndenier in chief, Donald Trump, attack what he called \u201cprophets of doom,\u201d \npresumably referring to activists like Greta Thunberg, who was also in \nattendance. Setting aside his apparent obsession with trashing this bold \nteenager, Mr. Trump has got it all wrong. I will reiterate my prediction that \nthose who jump into this climate space will make the next great fortunes in \ntech. More like \u201cprofits of boom.\u201d And if it takes Mr. Trump\u2019s unruly ranting to\n get our greatest minds focused on stopping our environmental suicide, so be it.\n The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by In Defense of Donald Trump Legal experts examine the \nstrongest and weakest points of his case.  By Spencer Bokat-Lindell Mr. Bokat-\nLindell is a writer in The New York Times Opinion section. This article is part \nof the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and \nThursdays. On Monday, President Trump\u2019s chief lawyers in his impeachment trial, \nJay Sekulow and Pat Cipollone, submitted a 110-page brief to the Senate laying \nout the case for his acquittal. The articles of impeachment, they say, are \u201can \naffront to the Constitution\u201d brought about by a \u201crigged\u201d \u201ccrusade\u201d against a \npresident who \u201cdid absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d  Reminder: The House of \nRepresentatives approved two articles of impeachment in December.  The first \narticle accuses Mr. Trump of abusing the power of the presidency to solicit \nforeign interference in the 2020 election by withholding military aid to \npressure his Ukrainian counterpart to announce investigations into a likely \nopponent in November\u2019s election, Joe Biden. The second article accuses Mr. Trump\n of obstructing the House\u2019s \u201csole Power of Impeachment\u201d by directing an \n\u201cunprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance\u201d of subpoenas related \nto the Ukraine affair.  Here are the key points in Mr. Trump\u2019s defense against \nthe charges and how legal experts are responding to them.  \u2018No crime or \nviolation of law whatsoever\u2019 Mr. Sekulow and Mr. Cipollone argue that \u201cabuse of \npower\u201d is not a crime defined in the federal legal code, and so it cannot be \nconsidered an impeachable offense. \u201cAfter focus-group testing various charges \nfor weeks, House Democrats settled on two flimsy Articles of Impeachment that \nallege no crime or violation of law whatsoever \u2014 much less \u2018high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors,\u2019 as required by the Constitution,\u201d they write. But this argument \nflies in the face of an \u201calmost universal consensus\u201d among legal scholars that \nan ordinary crime is not a prerequisite for impeachment. As Jesse Wegman, a \nmember of The Times\u2019s editorial board, writes, the standard of \u201chigh crimes and \nmisdemeanors\u201d has \u201calways been understood to refer to a unique class of \noffenses, those arising from what Alexander Hamilton called \u2018the misconduct of \npublic men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public \ntrust.\u2019\u201d He adds that the federal criminal code didn\u2019t even exist when the \nConstitution was drafted. There are a select few scholars, however, who say the \nconsensus should be reconsidered. One is Nikolas Bowie, an assistant professor \nat Harvard Law School. In 2018, Mr. Bowie suggested in the Harvard Law Review \nthat impeaching a president in the absence of an underlying criminal violation, \nwhether of statute or of common law, conflicts with a fundamental American legal\n principle: that a crime cannot be retroactively defined. An impeachment that \nlacks a criminal basis also risks setting a dangerous precedent that \u201cwould \napply not just to someone as unpopular as President Trump but also to future \npresidents whose policies happen to misalign with a congressional majority,\u201d he \nwrote. \u201cThe philosophical defense that the president should only be impeachable \nfor a defined statutory crime is probably the strongest defense available to \nTrump\u2019s supporters,\u201d writes Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School who \ntestified in the House impeachment inquiry. Worth noting: The Government \nAccountability Office did conclude last week that the Trump administration broke\n the law by freezing military aid to Ukraine, though the violation carries no \ncriminal penalties. \u2018Article I fails because House Democrats have no evidence\u2019  \nThe president\u2019s legal team also asserts that House Democrats do not have a \nsingle witness who claims with direct knowledge that he ever actually \nconditioned the release of military aid to Ukraine on the favor he requested of \nits leader. In their words: \u201cThere was no quid pro quo.\u201d Fact check: Witnesses \ntestified that they understood the aid freeze, as well as a delayed White House \nmeeting, to be tied to Mr. Trump\u2019s request. Officials who may have more direct \nknowledge of Mr. Trump\u2019s motives have been blocked by the White House from \ntestifying.  Perhaps more to the point, argues Mr. Feldman, the first \nimpeachment article doesn\u2019t hinge on the existence of a quid pro quo. \u201cOn its \nown, the request that Trump made to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in \nhis July 25, 2019, phone call qualifies as solicitation under the terms of the \narticle of impeachment. Trump abused his office merely by requesting the \u2018favor\u2019\n he mentioned in the call,\u201d he writes. \u201cNo actual exchange or quid pro quo is \nnecessary to sustain the charge of abuse of power.\u201d  \u2018 \u201cObstruction of Congress\u201d\n is not an impeachable offense\u2019 Moving on to the second article of impeachment, \nMr. Sekulow and Mr. Cipollone argue that the president\u2019s defiance of subpoenas \nissued by House Democrats was not \u201cobstruction\u201d; rather, it was an exercise of \nthe president\u2019s \u201cfundamental right\u201d to claim executive privilege.  Background: \nExecutive privilege is not a concept that originates from the Constitution, as \nAmelia Thomson-DeVeaux explains at FiveThirtyEight. Coined by the Eisenhower \nadministration and formalized during Watergate, it affords the president a \nrestricted (and vague) authority to withhold information with just and specific \ncause.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with exercising a power that\u2019s not \nexplicitly spelled out in the Constitution,\u201d says Ms. Thomson-DeVeaux. But the \npower has limits: Last year, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, of the Federal \nDistrict Court in Washington, ruled that advisers to the president do not have \n\u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from congressional subpoenas, contrary to what the \nadministration claimed. Critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal defense argue that it is \nhis blanket refusal to comply with Congress, and within the context of \nimpeachment, that elevates his conduct to the level of obstruction. \u201cIf the \nSenate takes seriously Mr. Trump\u2019s absolutist position,\u201d writes Ronald J. \nKrotoszynski Jr., a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, \u201cthe \nchamber will be establishing a startlingly dangerous precedent: that Congress \nlacks the constitutional authority to investigate effectively criminal \nwrongdoing within the highest levels of the executive branch, in this instance, \nallegations of bribery and misuse of government office for personal gain.\u201d  And \nin any event, writes Jennifer Rubin, President Trump \u201cnever actually invoked \nexecutive privilege (as many Republicans had falsely asserted).\u201d Still, some \nscholars contend that the Democrats weakened their obstruction case by not \ndeferring to the courts to clarify the power of executive privilege. \u201cIt\u2019s bad \nto refuse a lawful subpoena, but the appropriate remedy is to go to court to \nargue its lawfulness,\u201d tweeted Jed Shugerman, a Fordham Law professor. \u201cOnce the\n Dems decided not to challenge Trump\u2019s bad arguments for not cooperating, they \nalso abandoned the \u2018high crime\u2019 aspect of presidential abuse of power.\u201d \n[Related: \u201cShould the House Have Gone to the Courts on Obstruction Before \nImpeaching?\u201d] \u2018The impeachment inquiry in the House was irredeemably flawed\u2019 \nMore generally, Mr. Trump\u2019s team argues that the House impeachment process was \ninherently illegitimate because the Democrats launched the inquiry before \nauthorizing it with a full vote and then denied the president due process. \u201cNone\n of these objections hold up,\u201d The Times\u2019s editorial board wrote in October.  \n\u201cThough the full chamber voted to start impeachment inquiries against Presidents\n Bill Clinton and Richard M. Nixon, nothing in the Constitution or House rules \nrequires it. And outside of presidents, there are several cases of judicial \nimpeachments that began without a vote,\u201d according to Linda Qiu, a fact-check \nreporter at The Times. \u201cConstitutionally, the president has no rights in an \nimpeachment inquiry,\u201d writes Ms. Thomson-DeVeaux. \u201cTrump hasn\u2019t been charged \nwith a crime and impeachment isn\u2019t a legal proceeding, so he doesn\u2019t have any of\n the rights you hear about on \u2018Law and Order,' including due process.\u201d  \n[Related: Three reasons the law doesn\u2019t back up Mr. Trump\u2019s due process claims] \nThe argument, then, is less about the legality of the process than about its \nspirit, which many on the right have decried as unfair and nakedly partisan. \n\u201cHouse Democrats have discarded the Constitution, tradition and basic fairness \nmerely because they hate Mr. Trump,\u201d wrote David B. Rivkin Jr. and Elizabeth \nPrice Foley in The Wall Street Journal in October, days before the House voted \nto formalize the impeachment inquiry. \u2018Structurally deficient\u2019 Mr. Trump\u2019s \nlawyers also argue that the impeachment articles suffer from a fatal defect: \nThey are \u201cduplicitous,\u201d legally meaning that each charge cites multiple \noffenses. A vote on a duplicitous article, they argue, can never provide \ncertainty that a two-thirds majority has actually agreed on a specific basis for\n conviction.  This argument resembles part of Bill Clinton\u2019s defense against his\n impeachment articles, which, like some of those drafted against Richard Nixon \nand Andrew Johnson before him, each cited multiple offenses. \u201cA duplicitous \ncharge poses the acute danger of conviction by a less-than-unanimous jury,\u201d his \nlawyers wrote. \u201cSome jurors may find the defendant guilty of one charge but not \nguilty of a second, while other jurors find him guilty of a second charge but \nnot the first.\u201d But today\u2019s House Democrats have pointed out that the Senate \nrejected the effort to dismiss the articles against Mr. Clinton as duplicitous. \nMoreover, House Democrats say they deliberately drafted the articles against \nPresident Trump to avoid ambiguity: \u201cWhere the articles charged President \nClinton with engaging in \u2018one or more\u2019 of several acts, the Articles of \nImpeachment against President Trump do not,\u201d they write. \u201cThis difference \ndistinguishes President Trump\u2019s case from President Clinton\u2019s.\u201d Do you have an \nargument about Mr. Trump\u2019s defense we missed?

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Trump Versus George Washington What would the \nfounders have thought of this guy? By Gail Collins Opinion Columnist Wow, Adam \nSchiff did a great job in Marathon Impeachment. Schiff, one of the managers the \nHouse sent to handle the impeachment trial in the Senate, has been the rock star\n of the proceedings. (O.K., suggesting this is a rocking experience would be \u2026 \noverstatement. But you get the idea.) On Wednesday, Schiff spoke for nearly two \nand a half hours, nonstop, to open the Democrats\u2019 case. Not a record, but really\n long, even for a politician. Donald Trump took up just a little over two hours \nat his impeachment-day rally, when he had enough time to suggest that the late \nCongressman John Dingell went to hell and to call Schiff \u201cnot exactly the best-\nlooking guy we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Schiff\u2019s mission was to take the Senate \u2014 and \nbetter yet, the American public \u2014 through Trump\u2019s impeachable behavior, step by \nstep. It\u2019s certainly an action-packed story, and the Democrats have the \nadvantage of audiovisual aids. So much easier to keep the audience\u2019s interest \nwhen you\u2019ve got the title character on tape, saying stuff like, \u201cI have the \nright to do whatever I want as president.\u201d Schiff elevated the saga with a lot \nof American history. He mentioned the founding fathers 28 times in the first 15 \nminutes. On this front, it doesn\u2019t seem as if he\u2019s going to get much \ncompetition. Earlier, when Republicans had a chance to talk, the founders only \ncame up a handful of times, once in a quote from Chuck Schumer. For much of our \nmodern history Republicans have tended to be the ones continually quoting the \nfounding fathers, usually in regard to the dangers of an over-powerful federal \ngovernment. Now the tables have turned. Clearly Mitch McConnell and his minions \nneed to come up with some early American heroes who wouldn\u2019t have seen a problem\n with a president who tries to make secret deals with a foreign power in order \nto enhance his chances for re-election. On Wednesday, Schiff concluded with \nreferences to George Washington crossing the Delaware, Thomas Paine, \nWashington\u2019s farewell address and Benjamin Franklin announcing our government \nwould be \u201ca republic, if you can keep it.\u201d Other Democrats then picked up the \nstory, and they\u2019ll be doing it for quite a while. Senate Majority Leader \nMcConnell was originally going to make everybody cram the 24-hour quota of \nspeeches into two days, but the Democrats have now been given three days to make\n their case on a more reasonable schedule. The change was allegedly a result of \ncomplaints by a few moderate Republicans, notably Susan Collins of Maine, who \nwanted the process to look fair. Definitely an improvement. However, voters of \nMaine, I am trusting that when you decide whether to re-elect Collins this fall,\n you are not going to be moved by the news that before voting to keep Donald \nTrump in office, she used her powers to make the speaking schedule better. \nNobody has any real doubt about how this is going to end. McConnell is going to \ndeliver his people and get Trump off the hook. \u201cI\u2019m not an impartial juror. This\n is a political process,\u201d he said recently. This was a few weeks before the \nstart of the impeachment trial. Then suddenly Mitch transformed into a \nstatesman, begging his colleagues to \u201cput fairness, even-handedness and \nhistorical precedent ahead of the partisan passions of the day.\u201d Much talk about\n the need to show \u201csome fairness.\u201d Instantly the mind of every Democratic \nsenator flashed back to the time McConnell refused to allow Barack Obama\u2019s \nnominee to the Supreme Court to even come up for a hearing. And the huge pile of\n other judicial nominations that he let pile up in a basement somewhere, so he\u2019d\n be able to hand Donald Trump his biggest presidential achievement. \u201cFair is \nfair,\u201d McConnell continued on. Keeping Donald Trump in office is, of course, \ncritical for McConnell, the man who gets to actually run much of the country as \nlong as a distracted doofus is in the alleged driver\u2019s seat. Lately said doofus \nhas been in Switzerland, tucked away at the World Economic Forum, a pleasant \nannual get-together for people who like to talk about money in elevated terms. \nHe\u2019s made the occasional burst into public \u2014 expressing the wish that he could \nbe right there at the trial, where he could \u201csit right in the front row and \nstare into their corrupt faces.\u201d Really, try to imagine Donald Trump sitting \nstill for two and a half hours of anything. Let alone a recapitulation of all \nthe disasters of his term in office. His handlers, in a perfect world, would \nhave had him somewhere on a remote ice floe. \u201cAll I do is, I\u2019m honest,\u201d he told \nreporters clamoring for an impeachment reaction. \u201cI make great deals. I\u2019ve made \ngreat deals for our country.\u201d How do you think the founding fathers would have \nfelt about that? Just try to imagine if one of them got caught trying to trade \ntaxpayer money for political dirt on an opponent. And George Washington calming \na horrified colleague with, \u201cWell yeah, Mr. Hamilton, but remember \u2014 he makes \ngreat deals.\u201d The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the\n editor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Trump Acts Like a Politician. That\u2019s Not an \nImpeachable Offense. Receiving a \u201cpolitical benefit\u201d does not transform an \notherwise legal action (like requesting an investigation) into an abuse of \npower. By Josh Blackman Mr. Blackman is a constitutional law professor at the \nSouth Texas College of Law Houston. The way things look, President Trump will \nalmost certainly not be removed from office. The precedents set by the articles \nof impeachment, however, will endure far longer. And regrettably, the House of \nRepresentatives has transformed presidential impeachment from a constitutional \nparachute \u2014 an emergency measure to save the Republic in free-fall \u2014 into a \nparliamentary vote of \u201cno confidence.\u201d The House seeks to expel Mr. Trump \nbecause he acted \u201cfor his personal political benefit rather than for a \nlegitimate policy purpose.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers responded, \u201celected officials \nalmost always consider the effect that their conduct might have on the next \nelection.\u201d The president\u2019s lawyers are right. And that behavior does not amount \nto an abuse of power. Politicians pursue public policy, as they see it, coupled \nwith a concern about their own political future. Otherwise legal conduct, even \nwhen plainly politically motivated \u2014 but without moving beyond a threshold of \npersonal political gain \u2014 does not amount to an impeachable \u201cabuse of power.\u201d \nThe House\u2019s shortsighted standard will fail to knock out Mr. Trump but, if taken\n seriously, threatens to put virtually every elected official in peril. The \nvoters, and not Congress, should decide whether to reward or punish this self-\nserving feature of our political order. The first article of impeachment turns \non President Trump\u2019s request that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine \nannounce an investigation of Hunter Biden\u2019s role with the energy company \nBurisma. Mr. Trump wanted to learn about potential financial corruption \nconcerning Hunter, realizing that such an investigation would, perhaps, yield \ngreater scrutiny of Joe Biden. The House argues that this request to potentially\n harm Mr. Trump\u2019s political rival was an \u201cabuse of power.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers \nrespond that the call was \u201cperfectly normal.\u201d Yes, that phrase actually appears \nin the brief. Regrettably, parts of the brief are written in a far-too-political\n tone. But the president\u2019s lawyers have raised an important threshold issue. \u201cIn\n a representative democracy,\u201d they write, \u201celected officials almost always \nconsider the effect that their conduct might have on the next election.\u201d \nPresident Trump did not stand to receive any money or property from the \nUkrainian president. (The House wisely chose not to charge Mr. Trump with \nbribery.) As a policy matter, I disagree with Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to ask for an\n investigation of the Bidens. Even if warranted, it should have been avoided at \nall reasonable costs. The Republic would have been fine if we never learned more\n about Burisma. But receiving a \u201cpersonal political benefit\u201d does not transform \nan otherwise legal action \u2014 requesting an investigation \u2014 into impeachable \nconduct. Mr. Trump is not the first president to consider his political future \nwhile executing the office. In 1864, during the height of the Civil War, \nPresident Lincoln encouraged Gen. William Sherman to allow soldiers in the field\n to return to Indiana to vote. What was Lincoln\u2019s primary motivation? He wanted \nto make sure that the government of Indiana remained in the hands of Republican \nloyalists who would continue the war until victory. Lincoln\u2019s request risked \nundercutting the military effort by depleting the ranks. Moreover, during this \ntime, soldiers from the remaining states faced greater risks than did the \nreturning Hoosiers. Lincoln had dueling motives. Privately, he sought to secure \na victory for his party. But the president, as a party leader and commander in \nchief, made a decision with life-or-death consequences. Lincoln\u2019s personal \ninterests should not impugn his public motive: win the war and secure the \nnation. Consider a more recent example. In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson \nsought to put Thurgood Marshall, the prominent civil rights advocate, on the \nSupreme Court. But there were no vacancies. Not a problem for Johnson, who \nnominated as attorney general Ramsey Clark, the son of Supreme Court Justice Tom\n C. Clark. Johnson knew that this move would, as Wil Haygood wrote in \u201cShowdown:\n Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court Nomination That Changed America,\u201d raise\n questions \u201cabout a perceived conflict of interest because [Ramsey] Clark\u2019s \nfather sat on the high court.\u201d Indeed, Johnson hoped that Justice Clark would \nretire to avoid having to recuse from cases in which Attorney General Clark was \na party. The stratagem worked. Justice Clark soon retired, and Johnson appointed\n Thurgood Marshall to fill the vacancy. Here, Johnson engineered a move that \nwould have created conflicts that would keep a sitting Supreme Court justice \nfrom deciding countless appeals, where the primary purpose was to create a \nvacancy on the court. (Imagine if President Trump selected Chief Justice \nRoberts\u2019s wife as attorney general!) Ultimately, Johnson did not run for re-\nelection in 1968, but appointing the first African-American justice could have \nimproved his popularity, and perhaps his party\u2019s electoral standing. Politicians\n routinely promote their understanding of the general welfare, while, in the \nback of their minds, considering how those actions will affect their popularity.\n Often, the two concepts overlap: What\u2019s good for the country is good for the \nofficial\u2019s re-election. All politicians understand this dynamic, even \u2014 or \nperhaps especially \u2014 Mr. Trump. And there is nothing corrupt about acting based \non such competing and overlapping concerns. Politicians can, and do, check the \npolls before casting a difficult vote. Yet the impeachment trial threatens to \ntransform this well-understood aspect of politics into an impeachable offense. \nWhat separates an unconstitutional \u201cabuse of power\u201d from the valorized actions \nof Lincoln and Johnson? Not the president\u2019s motives. In each case, a president \nacted with an eye toward \u201cpersonal political benefit.\u201d Rather, Congress\u2019s \njudgment about what is a \u201clegitimate policy purpose\u201d separates the acclaimed \nfrom the criticized. Preserving a unified nation during the Civil War? Check. \nCreating a vacancy so the first African-American can be appointed to the Supreme\n Court? Check. But asking a foreign leader to investigate potential corruption? \nImpeach. An impeachable offense need not be criminal. But our Constitution does \nnot allow Congress to take a vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d for a president who pursues\n legal policies that members of the opposition party deem insufficiently \npublicly spirited. Presidents who take such actions with an eye toward the \nballot box should be judged by the voters at the ballot box.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Please Stop Calling Bernie Sanders a Populist The \nsocialist from Vermont is not a threat to American democracy. The president is. \nBy Jan-Werner M\u00fcller Mr. M\u00fcller is the author of \u201cWhat Is Populism?\u201d Bernie \nSanders is surging. What has changed? It cannot be the candidate, because, \nrightly or wrongly, voters perceive Mr. Sanders as always being his same \nsincere, authentic self. One thought is that, given how the Democratic field has\n narrowed, he might in the end be the man to beat President Trump, since he \nappeals to many of the angry citizens who proved decisive in 2016 \u2014 an anti-\nestablishment message vigorously pushed by the Sanders campaign itself. The \nobvious implication is that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump must have things in \ncommon: It has been claimed that both are populists, both divisive, both ready \nto break norms, both attack the news media, both have cult followings \u2014 the list\n could go on. Today, this false equation is being pushed by pundits on the right\n and, until now less loudly, by liberal centrists. But it is high time to retire\n the horseshoe theory according to which extremes of right and left must always \nmeet somewhere, such that the only salvation from \u201cpolitical sociopaths\u201d lies \nwith the center. Conventional wisdom has it that populists criticize elites. In \nrecent years, with the rise of populists around the globe, there is also the \nsuspicion that they pose a systematic threat to liberal democracy as such. But \nit is wrong simply to equate populism with being \u201canti-establishment.\u201d After \nall, any old civics textbook will say that keeping a critical eye on the \npowerful is actually a hallmark of being a good democratic citizen, and nothing \nparticularly populist. Figures like Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of \nHungary or President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey do indeed criticize elites. \nBut more important, they claim that they, and only they, represent what they \noften call the \u201creal people.\u201d As a result, they do not just attack other \ncontenders for power as fundamentally illegitimate, they also suggest that all \ncitizens who do not support them are not properly part of the people at all. Mr.\n Trump does not simply try to refute opposition to his policies, as any normal \npolitician would do; he attacks his critics as \u201cun-American.\u201d Mr. Erdogan says \nabout himself and his political party, \u201cwe are the people.\u201d Right-wing populists\n always wage culture wars with a view to excluding some citizens, symbolically \nor through actual disenfranchisement. While they incessantly talk about unifying\n the people, dividing them is actually the very basis of their political \nbusiness model. But is the left not guilty of the same sin? After all, in the \neyes of his critics, Mr. Sanders does not just criticize corruption, but \ndemonize what for years he has consistently been calling the \u201cbillionaire \nclass.\u201d Is that not also, centrists complain, demagogy, such that a discrete \ngroup of people is blamed for all ills in society? The differences are subtle, \nbut essential. There is nothing wrong as such with a politician or political \nmovement naming \u2014 and mobilizing against \u2014 powerful adversaries. Democracy is \nnot about consensus or bipartisanship or making us all get along. Its genius \nconsists in the idea that it\u2019s fine to have divisions and open conflicts. In \nfact, if there were no divisions at all, why would we have competitive \nelections? The point is that these conflicts can be settled peacefully and for \nspecified time periods through the ballot box (and be kept within civil bounds \nby a constitution, election laws and informal norms). Now, it does not follow \nthat it is O.K. to vilify powerful people, but not O.K. to incite hatred against\n vulnerable minorities, in the way Mr. Trump does. But the fact is that Mr. \nSanders (and, to an extent, Elizabeth Warren) are simply daring to diverge from \nsappy talk about healing America as a nation. They are saying loudly that we are\n not all equally in this together, but instead that we have sharply opposed \ninterests. Their rhetoric is perfectly compatible with democracy; it\u2019s just no \nmalarkey. Right-wing populists, by contrast, insinuate that some people do not \nbelong at all, or should be treated at best as second-class citizens. If the \nleft says, \u201cwe are the 99 percent,\u201d the right-wing populist in effect claims \u201cwe\n are the 100 percent.\u201d This basic attack on civic equality and inclusion \nexplains why, when in power, right-wing populists have invariably tried to take \ntheir countries in an authoritarian direction. One might think that Mr. \nSanders\u2019s policies are crazy (even if in fact they are inspired by Denmark, one \nof the world\u2019s most successful capitalist democracies). One might find him an \nold curmudgeon (even if his supposed \u201crudeness\u201d cannot possibly be put into the \nsame category as Mr. Trump\u2019s spectacular cruelty). But neither his policies nor \nhis personality poses a threat to the Republic. Mr. Trump does pose such a \nthreat and all those NeverTrumpers who are now saying they would vote only for \nthe right kind of Democrat better remember that no less than should liberals who\n equate democracy with centrist consensus.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Trump Is Abusing His Tariff Power, Too More contempt \nfor the rule of law. By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist So here\u2019s the story: \nDonald Trump has abused the powers of his office to threaten a U.S. ally. His \nthreat is probably illegal; his refusal to produce documents about his decision \nprocess is definitely illegal. And his claims about the motivation for his \nactions don\u2019t pass the laugh test. You probably think that I\u2019m talking about \nTrump\u2019s attempt to pressure Ukraine into producing political dirt on Joe Biden \nby withholding aid, and the subsequent cover-up \u2014 you know, the stuff for which \nhe has been impeached (and that half the country believes should lead to his \nremoval from office). But there\u2019s another, somewhat similar story: his repeated \nthreats to impose prohibitive tariffs on imports of automobiles from Europe. \nGranted, the auto tariff story isn\u2019t as vile as the Ukraine story, and it poses \nless of a direct threat to a fair election. But it\u2019s recognizably part of the \nsame syndrome: abuse of presidential power, contempt for the rule of law, and \ndishonesty about motivations. Some background: U.S. tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014\n are normally set the same way we set other taxes, through legislation that must\n pass Congress and then be signed by the president. The law does, however, give \nthe president discretion to impose temporary tariffs under certain \ncircumstances, for example to give U.S. industries a breathing space in the face\n of sudden import surges, to counter foreign export subsidies or to protect \nnational security (Section 232). Until Trump, Section 232 cases were rare. He \nhas, however, used the national security justification for tariffs with abandon,\n and zero regard for plausibility. Canadian aluminum poses a national security \nrisk? Really? And so it was that in 2018 the Trump administration announced that\n it was beginning a Section 232 investigation of auto imports, especially from \nEurope and Japan. Every trade expert I know considered the notion that German or\n Japanese cars constitute a threat to national security absurd. Nonetheless, in \n2019 a report from the Commerce Department concluded that auto imports do, \nindeed, endanger national security. What was the basis for this conclusion? \nWell, we don\u2019t actually know \u2014 because the Trump administration has refused to \nrelease the report. This stonewalling is clearly illegal. The statute requires \nthat all portions of the Commerce report that don\u2019t contain classified or \nproprietary information be published in the Federal Register, and it\u2019s hard to \nbelieve that any of the report contains such information, let alone the whole \nthing. Furthermore, Congress inserted a provision in a spending bill last month \nspecifically requiring that the Trump administration turn over the report. Why \nwon\u2019t Trump obey the law and hand over the document? My guess is that his people\n are afraid to let anyone see the Commerce report because it\u2019s embarrassingly \nthin and incompetent. To be honest, I have some doubts about whether the report \neven exists. Remember, the Commerce Department is run by Wilbur Ross, whom \nreaders of my colleague Gail Collins voted Trump\u2019s worst cabinet member, which \nis quite a distinction given the competition. Beyond all that, why does Trump \neven want to impose tariffs on European cars? Obviously it has nothing to do \nwith national security. But what\u2019s it really about? Part of the answer may be \nthat the self-proclaimed Tariff Man still believes that protectionism will \nrevive American manufacturing, even though the evidence says that his trade war \nhad the opposite effect. Beyond that, it appears that Trump tried to use the \nthreat of auto tariffs to bludgeon European nations into backing him up in his \nconfrontation with Iran. This is, by the way, a clear violation both of U.S. \nlaw, which does not give the president discretion to impose tariffs for reasons \nunrelated to economics, and of our international agreements, which prohibit this\n kind of bullying. And remember, the nations Trump was trying to bully are or \nwere among our most important allies, part of the coalition of democracies we \nused to call the Free World. These days, our erstwhile allies can no longer \nconsider America a reliable partner, on trade or anything else. Of course, that \nprobably doesn\u2019t bother Trump, who prefers autocrats like Vladimir Putin and \nMohammed bin Salman. So how should we think about the auto tariff saga? At one \nlevel it\u2019s part of the broader story of Trump\u2019s trade war, which has raised \nprices for American consumers, hurt U.S. businesses and farmers and deterred \nbusiness investment by creating uncertainty. But these economic considerations \nare, I\u2019d argue, much less important than the political aspects. Trump\u2019s scofflaw\n behavior with regard to auto tariffs is part of a broader pattern of abuse of \npower and contempt for the rule of law. On every front, Trump treats U.S. policy\n as a tool he can deploy as he chooses, in his own interests, without seeking \ncongressional approval or even informing Congress about what he\u2019s doing or why. \nBasically, the man in the White House operates on the principle that l\u2019\u00e9tat, \nc\u2019est Trump. It\u2019s a principle nobody who believes in American ideals should \naccept. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the \neditor.
