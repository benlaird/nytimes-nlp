            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Lesson of a Rescue Dog This bundle of mischief \nbears almost no resemblance to the fearful, troubled dog I adopted. There\u2019s a \nmetaphor in that. By Margaret Renkl Contributing Opinion Writer NASHVILLE \u2014 I \ncan\u2019t remember when my dog finally stopped screaming. This fact may be one of \nthe most remarkable things about our relationship: I have already forgotten how \nit feels to be steeled against Millie\u2019s screams. For months after we adopted her\n from a nearby rescue organization, Millie screamed all the time. It was her \nresponse not just to every unexpected touch but to every almost-touch, too. If \nyou merely walked past this dog, a sound would erupt that could freeze your \nblood and turn your heart to shards of ice. One night last week, she scratched \nat our door until she pushed it open. Millie doesn\u2019t leave her bed at night \nunless something outside worries her, so my husband got up to check. When he \nbumped into her in the dark, the little yelp that ensued was close enough to the\n traumatic screams of old that it brought me out of a sound sleep, heart \npounding. Then I remembered: It\u2019s just the dog. A screaming dog lives here. Only\n she\u2019s not a screaming dog anymore. Instead of bolting blindly for the farthest \npoint in the house from the offending foot, she hopped into bed with me. A long \nstroke down the length of her scruffy back, and she was comforted. Millie came \nto us severely traumatized in August of 2018. She was afraid of everything. A \ngentle pat from a toddler or the friendly sniff of a tiny puppy could make this \nfull-grown dog pee on herself in terror. The blinking lights of a mail truck \nsent her into a panic. A siren wailing two streets away meant there would be no \nenticing her outside for hours. So many sights and sounds terrified Millie that \nshe once went 36 hours straight without relieving herself. I had to sit on the \nfloor and hand-feed her, one piece of kibble at a time, to get her to eat. Last \nweek we walked past the lot where a monstrous mechanical tyrannosaur was \nscooping up the remains of a house it had just demolished. As we passed the \ncacophonous destruction zone, Millie picked up speed but didn\u2019t bolt. She didn\u2019t\n even look up to ask for the treat she knows she\u2019ll get for not freaking out in \nthe presence of something frightening. Lately it\u2019s been dawning on us that we \nmight have turned Millie into a bit of a brat. Early on, trying to convince her \nthat the world contains good things, my husband started saving her the last bite\n of his scrambled egg. This dog who for more than a year was almost entirely \nsilent now barks impatiently if she believes he\u2019s taking too long to finish \nbreakfast. This dog who had to be tricked into eating now knows exactly when the\n clock strikes 5 and paws at me unceasingly until I feed her. This dog who \nfeared all strangers now greets guests with a level of exuberance that not all \nguests actually welcome. She drinks out of unattended coffee cups, makes herself\n at home on the afghan my great-grandmother crocheted, rifles through open \ndrawers in hopes of discovering a cough drop. She has stolen a lot of cough \ndrops. People who haven\u2019t seen her in a while invariably make some version of \nthe same observation: \u201cThis is not the same dog I met last time.\u201d But she is the\n same dog. She\u2019s just a happier, braver version of herself. Perhaps most \nremarkably, her fears continue to fall away, day by day, the longer she is here.\n Even now, she is not yet the dog she is in the process of becoming. Millie \nreminds me that I am also a creature in the process of becoming. I, too, am \nstill learning to be brave, still trying to understand a world that holds so \nmuch cruelty and so much pain. Maybe we\u2019re all creatures in the process of \nbecoming. Against all immediate evidence, I hold out hope that the nation itself\n is in the process of living up to its own promise \u2014 unacceptably slowly but \nnonetheless still becoming. The arc of the moral universe will always bend \ntoward justice. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said that, and I try with \neverything I have in me to believe it. It would be absurd to turn this one \nlittle rescue dog into an analog for a troubled country, much less for humanity \nas a whole. This little rescue dog isn\u2019t even fully rescued herself. She will \nalways carry within her the life she endured before us. The brutality, the \nhunger, the fear \u2014 they will always be there, deep inside, just as they are for \nany other living thing who has suffered terribly. The body remembers pain. The \nbrain holds on to trauma. But we also cling to kindness. A stumble in the dark \nmay elicit a yelp, but a tender touch will always bring Millie back to us now. \nWhen cruelty is all the news ever seems to hold anymore, I try to remember that \ntoo.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by disability I Performed at the Super Bowl. You Might \nHave Missed Me. It was an act of both patriotism and protest. And it brought \nboth joy and frustration. By Christine Sun Kim Ms. Kim is an artist and \nperformer. As a child of immigrants, a grandchild of refugees, a Deaf woman of \ncolor, an artist and a mother, I was proud to perform the national anthem and \n\u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d in American Sign Language at the opening of the Super \nBowl on Sunday. I accepted the invitation to represent the National Association \nof the Deaf in partnership with the National Football League because I wanted to\n express my patriotism and honor the country that I am proud to be from \u2014 a \ncountry that, at its core, believes in equal rights for all citizens, including \nthose with disabilities. So while Yolanda Adams and Demi Lovato sang on the \n50-yard line at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, I signed along on the 40. \nUnfortunately, while the performance was broadcast in real time on the jumbo \nscreens in the stadium, those watching on their televisions, computers and \nphones got a seriously truncated version. While Fox Sports announced the signed \nperformance of the two songs on Twitter, it did not actually show it. On the \ntelevision broadcast, I was visible for only a few seconds. On what was supposed\n to be a \u201cbonus feed\u201d dedicated to my full performance on the Fox Sports \nwebsite, the cameras cut away to show close-ups of the players roughly midway \nthrough each song. Why have a sign language performance that is not accessible \nto anyone who would like to see it? It\u2019s 2020: We\u2019ve had the technology to do so\n for decades. And people noticed. The deaf actress Marlee Matlin, who has signed\n the anthem at three Super Bowls (in 1993, 2007 and 2016), tweeted: To ALL \nnetworks: next time at #SuperBowl when the signer like @chrisunkim is performing\n #NationalAnthem & America the Beautiful they should be on the broadcast the \nWHOLE time, not a few seconds. SHOW the beauty of ASL either in a bubble, split \nscreen or next to singer It\u2019s time! pic.twitter.com/C9gKykgZAI To be honest, it \nwas a huge disappointment \u2014 a missed opportunity in the struggle for media \ninclusiveness on a large scale. Though thrilled and excited to be on the field \nserving the deaf community, I was angry and exasperated. Still, my pride in \nbeing chosen for this performance was genuine. Because of the passage of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act in 1990, I have been afforded the rights and \naccess that have allowed me to live a life on par with my fellow citizens. I am \nable to watch TV with captions, make phone calls through an online video \nplatform, and have interpreters provided for my education, among many other \nprivileges. I have traveled to many countries and witnessed firsthand the lack \nof equality for deaf people all over the world, making me appreciate being an \nAmerican even more. I realize that being a citizen of this country is not \nsomething to be taken for granted. It is a little-known fact that the N.F.L. has\n been providing some access to deaf people for more than three decades. \nRecently, that has extended to game-day commercials. In 2008, Alexis Kashar, a \ndeaf civil rights attorney, raised the issue of Super Bowl commercials not being\n fully captioned with the N.F.L. Ms. Kashar, who at that time was the chair of \nthe National Association of the Deaf\u2019s civil rights committee, brought in her \ncolleague Howard A. Rosenblum, the organization\u2019s chief executive, to petition \nfor more accessibility. The N.F.L. subsequently encouraged advertisers to \naddress the issue, even though they were not required by law to add captions. \nWithin a few years almost all Super Bowl commercials were captioned. The N.A.D. \ncontinues to ensure the commercials are captioned to this day. Even so, I \naccepted the invitation with some hesitation. Being deaf in America has always \nbeen political, and I needed to process some internal conflict before accepting.\n I knew that some musical artists had refused opportunities to perform at the \ngame last year in support of Colin Kaepernick. I wondered whether I should do \nthe same. I thought of the deaf people who had been mistreated or killed by \npolice. I thought about Robert Kim, a deaf man who was beaten and tasered in \n2012 by a police officer in a St. Louis suburb; and Daniel Kevin Harris, who was\n shot and killed in 2016 by a North Carolina state trooper; and two Oklahoma \nmen, Pearl Pearson, who was badly beaten by police officers in 2014, and Magdiel\n Sanchez, who was shot and killed by police in front of his home in Oklahoma \nCity in 2017. These incidents are part of a pattern, as Amiel Fields-Meyer noted\n in a 2017 article for The Atlantic. While the Americans with Disabilities Act \nrequires the government to provide \u201ceffective communication\u201d and \u201creasonable \naccommodation,\u201d Fields-Meyer wrote, \u201cWhen it comes to the deaf community, \nofficers\u2019 gaps in cultural competency have led to strain and miscommunication \u2014 \nand, at times, the use of deadly force.\u201d Of course, deaf people face many other \nobstacles and injustices: limited access to mental health service, health care \nand sign language itself, inadequate online accessibility, lack of employment \nopportunities and more. And as usual, these inequalities and the burden of their\n effects fall disproportionately on people of color. But in the end, I accepted \nthe invitation. Our rights can easily disappear if we do not continue to show up\n in places like the Super Bowl. I had hoped to provide a public service for deaf\n viewers, and believed that my appearance might raise awareness of the systemic \nbarriers and the stigmas attached to our deafness \u2014 and move some people to \naction. I hope that despite the failure of Fox to make the performance \naccessible to all, it did do that. What kind of action? My parents took action \nby learning to sign for my Deaf sister and me. This made us feel seen and \nrespected. Today, I\u2019m teaching my hearing child to sign as well. Respecting all \nlanguages and identities can only lead to better laws and a higher quality of \nlife. Signing the anthem was a way to celebrate my language. The N.A.D. has \nposted video of my entire performances of \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d and the \nnational anthem on YouTube. I wholeheartedly support the efforts to promote \naccessibility and equality that have been undertaken by the N.F.L. and the \nN.A.D. I also stand in recognition and support of those who have used the \nN.F.L.\u2019s platform toward wider goals of social justice. I see my performance as \npart of that expression.

But doing so also\n allows people to publicly shame how others deal with loss. \u201cCancel the games. \nCancel the Grammys.,\u201d one person wrote on Twitter. Another criticized those who \nbrought up the rape allegation against Bryant in their commemorations: \u201cSome \npeople have no respect for the dead.\u201d This is part of a broader phenomenon. \nThese \u201cgrief police\u201d enforce murky standards of who should be sad, when they\u2019re \nallowed to be and to what degree. They insist that our grief must be \noverwhelming and ubiquitous, and for all parts of our lives to be put on hold. \nThis isn\u2019t just problematic in the moment; introducing guilt into the grieving \nprocess can negatively impact others\u2019 ability to heal. Something similar \nhappened at Barnard College where, in December, we were forced to grieve in the \nmedia spotlight after one of the newest members of our community, the first-year\n student Tess Majors, was murdered. I have spent my career researching anxiety \nand worry, and I was struck by a commonality among people on campus: Amid their \nfeelings of heartbreak, members of our community were worried about how others \nwould perceive their specific form of grieving. I wasn\u2019t aware of students \npolicing others\u2019 grief, but the perception that this was happening still had an \neffect, especially given the media attention around the tragedy. One student \ntold me that, in the midst of her deep sorrow, she also felt guilty about \nfeeling eager to write her final papers and was worried she would be judged for \nnot mourning in the \u201cright\u201d way. Another student mentioned that she didn\u2019t know \nTess Majors personally and was feeling all right, even looking forward to a \nlong-planned family trip over break, but was going to keep this thought to \nherself. I bet some of the N.B.A. players who were eager to play in the wake of \nBryant\u2019s death also had mixed feelings \u2014 because they are being judged. LeBron \nJames was skewered online for not immediately posting about his friend and \nmentor: \u201cWhy are you not posting Kobe? I never liked LeBron because he is always\n FULL of himself,\u201d one person wrote on social media. Public grieving doesn\u2019t \nhappen in a single community where there are shared social norms for how to \nreact, like sitting shiva or walking in a second line. If bereaved players are \nslow to comment publicly, should we call them out? Must everyone who has ever \nmet Bryant say something in public? When people with vastly different lived \nexperiences come together around a public death, there is no real shared \nunderstanding of what is appropriate; this is why the grief police wield such \npower in calling people out. Unfortunately, introducing blame into the grieving \nprocess causes people to question whether they are dealing with loss the right \nway and to feel guilty about what they do, say and feel. Recent research has \nlinked guilt in bereavement to a wide range of mental and physical difficulties,\n including depression. So how, in the age of communal and public mourning, do we\n grieve and not let the grief police undercut how we feel? How do we continue to\n perform at our best with heavy hearts? Everyone responds to death differently, \nand it\u2019s psychologically healthy to focus on parts of our identity that are not \ntouched by tragedy. It is O.K. for a grieving athlete to play an important game;\n the same goes for a student who wants to take her finals in the wake of a \ncampus tragedy. Research on resiliency shows quite clearly that people who \nexpress (and value) different aspects of who they are tend to be psychologically\n stronger. For example, their role as an athlete, student or parent provides \nanother outlet to express themselves if they experience a setback or loss in one\n aspect of their life, or if one of the ways they identify themselves is called \ninto doubt. Embracing the fullness of our identities in no way represents a lack\n of respect or a blindness to the gravity of a tragedy. Quite the opposite: It \nis only through this process that we can effectively take care of one another, \nincluding those who have been most affected. Despite my expertise in this \nsubject, I have had to force myself over the last month to realize that, even in\n mourning, I have to juggle life as a college president, a researcher, a mother,\n an athlete and a friend \u2014 not only for my own health and mind-set, but also for\n the well-being of those around me. When the grief police arrive, we need to \ngive ourselves license to express positive emotions and affirm other aspects of \nourselves that we value outside of the tragedy. Doing so means we will feel more\n in control and cope better down the line. Sian Beilock (@sianbeilock), a \ncognitive scientist, is the president of Barnard College.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Exhaustion Caucus The election cycle is \nstressful, but voters must remain enthusiastic and determined. By Charles M. \nBlow Opinion Columnist Republicans in the Senate are poised to acquit Donald \nTrump without even truly putting him on trial. They have allowed no new \nwitnesses and no new evidence. And why would they? If they know that their plan \nall along was to let him get away with his corruption and stonewalling, more \nevidence only reveals their treachery in sharper relief. So, once again, Trump \nnot only survives his venality, he is emboldened by the lily-livered cowards\u2019 \nfear of crossing him. This is the dawn of American authoritarianism, and \nRepublicans are not only not trying to stop it, many are openly cheering it. The\n rest of us \u2014 many of us, anyway \u2014 are aghast, overcome and exhausted. There is \na never-ending stream of dishonesty, offense and hostility emanating from this \nadministration, sometimes too much to properly track. It at times overwhelms \npeople\u2019s capacity for outrage. And, in that deluge of grief and distress, many \nsimply chose to disconnect. I cannot tell you how often I meet people \u2014 \nintelligent, interested and interesting people \u2014 who say that they have simply \nhad to disengage from the news as an actual means of mental health and spiritual\n survival. This phenomenon of \u201cnews avoidance\u201d has taken on an acute peculiarity\n in the age of Trump. A paper last year in SAGE Journals found that people were \nexperiencing high levels of stress and emotionality when talking about political\n news now, and they \u201cfrequently develop mechanisms to cope with high levels of \nemotionality.\u201d A 2017 \u201cStress in America\u201d survey by the American Psychological \nAssociation found: \u201cMore than half of Americans (57 percent) say the current \npolitical climate is a very or somewhat significant source of stress, and nearly\n half (49 percent) say the same about the outcome of the election.\u201d Early on, \ntherapist Steven Stosny named this phenomenon \u201celection stress disorder.\u201d The \nA.P.A.\u2019s former executive director for professional practice, Dr. Katherine C. \nNordal, has advised people, \u201cIf the 24-hour news cycle is causing you stress, \nlimit your media consumption.\u201d  She continued: \u201cRead enough to stay informed but\n then plan activities that give you a regular break from the issues and the \nstress they might cause. And remember to take care of yourself and pay attention\n to other areas of your life.\u201d That is precisely what many people are doing: \nturning away from Trump, to the degree they can, and pouring their passions into\n pet projects, things they can actually control, things close to them where they\n feel they can make more of a difference. But, even as such, Trump is still \nsomewhat inescapable. He has seized on America\u2019s obsessions. He has bored his \nway into our brains. Even when you are not obsessively consuming news about him,\n he is still omnipresent. Trump has arrived at a moment of supreme voyeurism and\n compulsive fame whoring. He has stepped into our flaws and stretched open our \nshame. He is a genuine danger, but also a perfect object for political mania. \nStill for some people, being checked out means they consume less of the poison, \nand that is the only way they feel they can survive. I struggle with how to \nevaluate these people. In a way, I completely understand. Sometimes I, too, take\n a day or a weekend away from the insanity to preserve my own peace. But is a \nsustained disconnect irresponsible and a demerit on one\u2019s political citizenship?\n Does disconnection represent a drift toward cynicism, self-defeat and apathy? I\n don\u2019t think it has to be, but I worry that on some level it is inevitable. I \nsee two main groups of people who want Trump gone: the exhausted and the \nexcited. The exhausted just need this nightmare to draw to a close. The excited \nhave a replacement candidate about whom they are passionate. The former, I \nbelieve. lean more on the electability argument, and the latter promote the more\n transformative candidate. Both groups can be highly motivated to vote, but I \nwill concede that it is a much better feeling to vote for someone rather than \nagainst someone. The exhausted contingent simply lacks the spark of excitement. \nOutrage, while essential, isn\u2019t by itself sufficient. So, I say to the people \nwho have tuned out: I get it. Take some time. But, re-engagement is essential. \nThe resistance is not dead. It\u2019s not even flagging. I know that it can be \ndispiriting that Trump has done so much but suffered so little for it. But, this\n is your season of action and influence. On Monday the electoral stretch kicks \noff with the Iowa caucuses. America has a choice to make, and you will be part \nof the choosing. Get excited! Manufacture enthusiasm if you must. Democrats have\n options. Yes, they each have hurdles and negatives, but there are also some \nstriking positives. But none of this will matter if, in November, Trump\u2019s \nopponent isn\u2019t pushed over the top with overwhelming electoral energy. You \nsimply can\u2019t afford to stay disconnected.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by The Simple Reason Trump Does What He Does Because he \ncan. By David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist It wasn\u2019t the most notorious part of \nthe \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, but it was the most revealing: \u201cAnd when you\u2019re a \nstar, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d Donald Trump was talking in 2005\n to Billy Bush, then a host of the celebrity-news program \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d It\n was hardly a private moment. They were wearing microphones and surrounded by a \ncamera crew. Before their interview began, Trump explained how he liked to \n\u201cmove\u201d on women, kissing them without their permission and grabbing their \ngenitalia. In the more than three years since the tape emerged, it\u2019s become \nclear that the you-can-do-anything line wasn\u2019t only describing Trump\u2019s attitude \ntoward women. It was describing his attitude toward everything: If you\u2019re rich, \nfamous or powerful, you can get away with much more than most people understand.\n You just do it. You don\u2019t need to worry about ethical niceties or even, \nsometimes, the law. You use your advantages to bulldoze any obstacles. For \nanyone trying to make sense of the impeachment trial, this attitude is central. \nIt\u2019s why Trump pressured Ukraine to conduct a smear campaign in the first place:\n Because he could. And it\u2019s how Trump organized his defense in the Senate. His \nlawyers offered a brazenly inconsistent series of arguments, from \u201cHe did \nnothing wrong\u201d to \u201cThere was no quid prod quo\u201d to \u201cThere were no witnesses to \nthe quid pro quo\u201d to, finally, \u201cIf a president does it, it\u2019s O.K.\u201d You could \nalmost hear the echo of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in the Senate last week: \nWhen you\u2019re president, you can do anything. In that conversation with Billy \nBush, Trump was describing his life\u2019s credo. It is amoral, entitled and \nopportunistic. It has also been remarkably consistent. Trump first learned this \napproach from his father and benefactor, Fred. The Trumps didn\u2019t want black \npeople living in their apartment buildings in the 1960s, so they refused to rent\n apartments to many black people. It was illegal, but the government did not \ncare enough about racism to impose serious punishment. The Trumps also wanted to\n be richer than their business was making them. So they committed financial \nfraud, evading taxes to increase Trump\u2019s inheritance from his father. Again, \nthey got away with it. After Donald Trump took over the business, he stiffed \nworkers, contractors and lenders. He claimed to be wealthier than he was. He \ncheated on his wives and, according to more than a dozen different women, \ncommitted sexual assault. With his casino business close to collapse, he used \nhis celebrity to reinvent himself on reality television. When you\u2019re a star, \nthey let you do it. Trump next brought this approach to politics. It explains \nthe constant lying, the insults and bigotry, the threats of violence and \nprosecution and the cozying up to foreign enemies. It also explains his \nperceptive claim that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not get in \ntrouble. Trump does what he thinks is best for him, often in open defiance of \nrules or customs that constrain almost everybody else. The impeachment trial has\n been a case study. No American president before Trump would have dared to \ncollaborate openly with foreign countries for partisan advantage. Trump has done\n so repeatedly, starting in the summer of 2016 with Russia and then with China, \nUkraine and perhaps unknown others. He had the ability to do it, so he did it. \nObviously, Trump\u2019s credo is only half of the impeachment story, because the \nSenate is supposed to be an independently powerful body, not a political servant\n to the White House. Yet Trump has understood, consciously or otherwise, that \nthe Senate isn\u2019t what it used to be. It is controlled today by the Republican \nParty, and that party has changed. For much of American history, Congress would \nhave reined in a reckless president, even if he were in the same party as \ncongressional leaders. Congress certainly would have insisted on hearing from \nimpeachment witnesses with crucial information. Every single Senate impeachment \ntrial before the current one \u2014 all 15, for lower-level officials as well as both\n Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton \u2014 included witnesses. But the \ncurrent Republican Party cares more about holding on to power than anything \nelse. In service of this goal, the party has even fought democracy, be it \npreventing American citizens from voting, changing the rules for Supreme Court \nnominations, stripping authority from incoming governors or running an \nimpeachment trial unconcerned with facts. Why has the Republican Party changed? \nThe political scientist Theda Skocpol offers a useful two-part explanation in a \nnew book, \u201cUpending American Politics.\u201d First, the sharp rise of inequality has \nempowered conservative donors and activists who want to protect their fortunes \nby shrinking government. Second, many rank-and-file voters have grown angry \nabout economic stagnation and anxious about immigration and secularization. \nThese voters have become attracted to, or at least tolerant of, a politics \ntinged with ethno-nationalism and authoritarianism. The country is left with a \npresident who has spent decades doing whatever he thinks is in his self-interest\n \u2014 and a political party willing to protect that president. Staying in power \ntrumps all. That, of course, is the ideology of autocracy. And although the \nUnited States is not an autocracy, our country is taking steps in that direction\n that I never imagined we would.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Joe Biden: A Really Nice Guy for President His pitch \nin Iowa couldn\u2019t be simpler. Is it what voters want? By Frank Bruni Opinion \nColumnist DES MOINES \u2014 I\u2019ve heard Joe Biden speak twice in Iowa over recent \ndays. Both times, I walked away barely able to remember a single issue he \nmentioned. I had to check my notes. Ah, yes, guns: He touched on that. Climate \nchange, too. That flitted by. But Biden\u2019s closing argument in Iowa, whose \ncaucuses Monday night provide the first meaningful measure of the traction that \nthe various Democratic candidates have found, doesn\u2019t hinge on any of those. \nThat\u2019s because his bid for his party\u2019s presidential nomination doesn\u2019t, either. \nMaybe more than any campaign I\u2019ve observed over the past quarter century, it\u2019s \nabout character \u2014 his and the country\u2019s. It\u2019s about honesty, decency, empathy, \nhumanity. For reasons we\u2019ll be plumbing for many years to come, America in 2016 \nelected a president bereft of those traits, and the country ever since has been \nin a moral free fall. So Biden is waging a \u201cbattle for the soul of the nation.\u201d \nIt says so in big letters on the side of the bus that has been carrying him \nthrough this state. He\u2019s running to reconnect America with the best of itself. \nAt a crowded, spirited rally here in Des Moines late Sunday afternoon, he \nrecited and railed against examples of Donald Trump\u2019s cruelty, his voice thick \nwith disgust. Speaking to hundreds of voters in Waukee, Iowa, on Thursday \nmorning, he asked: \u201cDoes it matter if a president has no moral compass?\u201d It was \na rhetorical question and the core of his message. It was also powerful, much \nmore so than I expected. In debates and television interviews since he formally \nentered the race for the Democratic nomination last April, Biden, 77, has been \nunimpressive, his energy palpably diminished, his sentences wobbling toward some\n destination other than the initially intended one. On the stump, though, he has\n vigor. He has something else, too: an aura of overarching goodness that\u2019s a \ntonic in the context of Donald Trump. I found myself quaffing it greedily, \nparched from the past few weeks, when Trump\u2019s Senate trial confirmed how unbound\n the president is and how completely Republican lawmakers have surrendered their\n integrity to him. Will Iowans find Biden as consoling as I do? Can \u201cconsoling\u201d \ndrive people to the polls? Recent voter surveys give the edge in the caucuses to\n Bernie Sanders, who also leads in New Hampshire, could wind up winning the \nfirst two Democratic contests and has a profoundly different vibe. He\u2019s about \nfighting fire with fire. Biden is about dousing the flames with compassion. And \nfor many voters, that\u2019s \u201ca nostalgia act whose well-worn slogans about middle-\nclass uplift and national unity are out of sync in this season of outrage,\u201d as \nMolly Ball wrote in Time magazine last week. Biden was on the cover. As I pinged\n around Iowa and heard speeches by all four leading candidates (Sanders, Biden, \nElizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg), I realized that there are three R\u2019s of \nthis Democratic primary. There\u2019s revolution, which is what Sanders expressly \nurges \u2014 \u201crevolution\u201d is his mantra \u2014 and which Warren less bluntly promotes, \ncalling for \u201cbig structural change\u201d and vowing to \u201ctake our government back.\u201d \nThere\u2019s rejuvenation: Buttigieg, 38, leans on the fact that his three main \nrivals are all 70 or older to stress the importance of a fresh set of eyes and \nthe need to give a new generation of politicians a chance. And there\u2019s \nrestoration. That\u2019s Biden, the country\u2019s vice president from January 2009 to \nJanuary 2017. He weaves many references to President Barack Obama into his \nremarks, mentioning \u201cour administration,\u201d and in a 60-second video that he shows\n at the start of his events, Obama\u2019s face appears before his does and pops up \nanother two times. What Biden is promising, though, isn\u2019t so much a return of \npersonnel or policies as of propriety. He wants to make America normal again. He\n told the Waukee crowd that in Trump\u2019s world, \u201cUp is down, lies are the truth, \nallies are enemies. Everything is through the looking glass.\u201d He\u2019s going to \nrescue us from that wicked wonderland. And he\u2019s going to do it by being a really\n nice guy. Let Sanders go point by point through the virtues of Medicare for \nall. Let Warren illuminate the intricacies of her anti-corruption plan. Biden is\n fuzzier and gooier than that \u2014 by design. You\u2019re supposed to leave a Sanders or\n Warren rally suffused with righteous anger. You leave a Biden rally sort of \nmisty and choked up. His event in Waukee was arguably most memorable for remarks\n by Tom Vilsack, the former governor of Iowa, and his wife, Christie, about how \nloving and supportive Biden had been to their family three years ago, when their\n 6-year-old granddaughter died. Biden, they said, knows about loss, having \nburied two of his own children, along with his first wife. It has humbled him. \nSeasoned him. He senses sorrow and does what he can to soothe it. They made him \nsound like an angel, and maybe I\u2019m also making him sound that way. He\u2019s not. His\n record as a senator for almost four decades is full of questionable judgment \ncalls, messy compromises, expedient affiliations. There\u2019s gunk there, if not in \nthe places where Trump insisted it was. But there\u2019s also enough merit for him to\n make his curious and curiously compelling pitch. It\u2019s a mature pitch, too, \nimplicitly acknowledging that none of the grand plans that the Democratic \ncandidates describe are likely to be enacted as is. What voters should choose, \nthen, is someone with values and a temperament they trust. That\u2019s Nancy Bobo\u2019s \nthinking. Bobo, 67, showed up to hear Biden in Waukee and said that she\u2019d caucus\n for him on Monday night. \u201cTrump has empowered people to be hateful,\u201d she told \nme, adding that the answer to that is a leader who\u2019s \u201cdecent, kind and loving.\u201d \nBiden checks those boxes for her. Biden makes her feel good about things. Does \nthat make him the Democrat most likely to beat Trump, which matters so much more\n than anything else? Got me. We\u2019re all just lobbing guesses, crossing our \nfingers and holding our breath. But I do think that the potency of Biden\u2019s \nappeal as the smile to Trump\u2019s scowl, the calm to his storm and the rectitude to\n his dissoluteness may be underrated. Trump has a cameo in that 60-second video,\n which shows him in mid-scream. It ends with an image of the Oval Office and \nthese words: \u201cCharacter matters \u2014 maybe here more than anywhere.\u201d Every \nDemocratic candidate would agree with that. Only Biden is putting all of his \nchips there. I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter. You \ncan follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni).

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by How Zombies Ate the G.O.P.\u2019s Soul Everyone with \nprinciples has left the party. By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist Is this the \nweek American democracy dies? Quite possibly. After all, everyone in Washington \nunderstands perfectly well that Donald Trump abused the powers of his office in \nan attempt to rig this year\u2019s presidential election. But Senate Republicans are \nnonetheless about to acquit him without even pretending to look at the evidence,\n thereby encouraging further abuses of power. But how did we get to this point? \nPart of the answer is extreme partisanship and right-wing political correctness \n(which is far more virulent than anything on the left). But I also blame the \nzombies. A zombie idea is a belief or doctrine that has repeatedly been proved \nfalse, but refuses to die; instead, it just keeps shambling along, eating \npeople\u2019s brains. The ultimate zombie in American politics is the assertion that \ntax cuts pay for themselves \u2014 a claim that has been proved wrong again and again\n over the past 40 years. But there are other zombies, like climate change \ndenial, that play an almost equally large role in our political discourse. And \nall of the really important zombies these days are on the right. Indeed, they \nhave taken over the Republican Party. It was not always thus. Back in 1980 \nGeorge H.W. Bush called Ronald Reagan\u2019s extravagant claims about the \neffectiveness of tax cuts \u201cvoodoo economic policy.\u201d Everything that has happened\n since has vindicated his original assessment. Deficits ballooned after Reagan \ncut taxes; they shrank and eventually turned into surpluses after Bill Clinton \nraised taxes, then ballooned again after George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts. Voodoo has \nalso crashed and burned at the state level: The Kansas experiment in radical tax\n cuts was a dismal failure, while California\u2019s tax hike under Jerry Brown, which\n conservatives declared a case of \u201ceconomic suicide,\u201d was followed by a revenue \nand economic boom. Yet voodoo economics has become unchallengeable doctrine \nwithin the Republican Party. Even fake moderates like Susan Collins justified \ntheir support for the 2017 Trump tax cut by claiming that it would reduce the \nbudget deficit. Predictably, the deficit actually exploded, and now exceeds $1 \ntrillion a year. The politics of climate change have followed a similar \ntrajectory. Global temperature keeps setting records, while climate-related \ncatastrophes like the Australian wildfires are proliferating. Yet a majority of \nRepublicans in Congress are climate deniers \u2014 many of them buying into the \nnotion that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by a vast international \nscientific conspiracy \u2014 and even those, like Marco Rubio, who grudgingly admit \nthat global warming is real oppose any significant action to limit emissions. \nIt\u2019s important to realize that the zombification of the G.O.P. isn\u2019t a recent \nphenomenon, something that happened only with Trump\u2019s election. On the contrary,\n zombies have been eating Republican brains for decades. Voodoo economics had \ncompletely taken over the party by the early 2000s, when then-House majority \nleader Tom DeLay declared, \u201cNothing is more important in the face of war than \ncutting taxes.\u201d Climate deniers have ruled since at least 2009, when only eight \nHouse Republicans supported a bill to limit greenhouse gas emissions. What \nrecent events make clear, however, is that zombie ideas haven\u2019t eaten just \nRepublicans\u2019 brains. They have also eaten the party\u2019s soul. Think about what is \nnow required for a Republican politician to be considered a party member in good\n standing. He or she must pledge allegiance to policy doctrines that are \ndemonstrably false; he or she must, in effect, reject the very idea of paying \nattention to evidence. It takes a certain kind of person to play that kind of \ngame \u2014 namely, a cynical careerist. There used to be Republican politicians who \nwere more than that, but they were mainly holdovers from an earlier era, and at \nthis point have all left the scene, one way or another. John McCain may well \nhave been the last of his kind. What\u2019s left now is a party that, as far as I can\n tell, contains no politicians of principle; anyone who does have principles has\n been driven out. Now, the news media, with its constant urge to seem \n\u201cbalanced,\u201d has a hard time coping with this reality; it\u2019s always looking for \nways to portray at least some Republicans as admirable figures. This has made it\n easy prey for charlatans like Paul Ryan, who pretended to be serious about his \nfiscal principles. But he was always an obvious flimflam man. Anyway, a result \nof decades of zombification is a Republican caucus that consists entirely of \nsoulless opportunists (and no, the fact that some of them like to quote \nScripture doesn\u2019t change that fact). I guess you might have hoped that there \nwould be some limits to what these apparatchiks would accept, that even they \nwould draw the line at gross abuses of power and collusion with foreign \nautocrats. What we\u2019ve learned, however \u2014 and perhaps more important, what Trump \nhas learned \u2014 is that there is no line. If Trump wants to dismantle democracy \nand rule of law (which he does), his party will stand with him all the way. The \nTimes is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

By Max Brooks Mr. Brooks is the author of \u201cWorld War Z.\u201d Editors\u2019 note: \nThis is part of the Op-Eds From the Future series, in which science fiction \nauthors, futurists, philosophers and scientists write Op-Eds that they imagine \nwe might read 5, 10, 50 or even 200 years from now. The challenges they predict \nare imaginary \u2014 for now \u2014 but their arguments illuminate the urgent questions of\n today and prepare us for tomorrow. The Opinion piece below is a work of \nfiction. The United States Army is on strike. It\u2019s difficult to believe that \nAmerica\u2019s contracted defenders have simply walked off the job \u2014 especially at a \ntime like this. As contract negotiations lumber into their third, fruitless \nmonth, the world seems to be coming apart at the seams. In Arabia, the fractured\n Saudi Principalities continue their bloody power struggles. In North Korea, the\n coup that took down the Kim dynasty has degenerated into all-out civil war, \nwith a looming threat of nuclear action. To our north, the Sino-Russian \npeacekeeper divisions have openly refused to withdraw from Quebec. This last \ncrisis puts at least four confirmed I-mech battalions and possibly one full \ncyclone brigade within hyperswarm range of Washington, D.C. All the while, our \nbases remained shuttered, our ships docked, our aircraft grounded and even our \njoint cyberspace network \u2014 the core of our national defense \u2014 continues to be \n\u201ctemporarily unavailable\u201d while its operators sit at home waiting to hear about \ntheir new pay raise, working hours, vacation days and, as stateless citizens, \nimmunity from not only war crimes but all crimes under U.S. law. In the old days\n of the Army, this would have been a mutiny. But \u201cmutiny\u201d implies the revolt of \ngovernment troops, not private contractors. And that is who\u2019ve we\u2019ve entrusted \nto our security. Mercenaries. For two decades our country has slept under the \nwatch of people motivated by profit, from the chief executive Maniple Ltd. to \nthe men and women on foreign battlefields. We need to stop calling them \n\u201ctraitors\u201d because treason implies violating an oath of loyalty. They never \nviolated their oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\n because they never took one. And why should they? We\u2019re talking about corporate\n employees, not public servants. And if their union is lawfully demanding a \nlarger benefit package, why should we be surprised? If we have a problem with \nthat kind of greed, we need to admit that it was our greed that caused the \nproblem in the first place. The march toward privatization didn\u2019t begin with the\n Defense Reform Act of 2032. It didn\u2019t even begin, as some are now suggesting, \nwith President George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cgo to the mall\u201d speech of 2001. The cold, hard \ntruth is that Americans have been slowly retreating from being the nation\u2019s \nprotectors for a long time, and, ironically, the first step on that retreat was \ntaken exactly a century ago. In 1950, during the First Korean War, we broke with\n a tradition going back to our revolution: war bonds. Up until that moment, \nevery American citizen had the privilege of contributing to the nation\u2019s defense\n by purchasing defense bonds. If you still have access to a non-Chinese, open-\nsource search engine (I still trust Quezon or Wallenberg), try looking up \u201cWorld\n War II bond drives.\u201d You\u2019ll see a variety of videos from a variety of celebrity\n influencers rallying the public to invest in national security. During the \nKorean conflict, that investment ended, along with an individual connection to \nthe greater good. And it was only the first step. Ending the draft in the 1970s \nmight have seemed like a good idea at the time. The Vietnam War tore our society\n apart, creating a cultural rift that we still have yet to close. People were \nsick of seeing poor kids sent off to combat while rich and middle-class kids \n(remember when we still had a middle class?) duck out of harm\u2019s way. The \nmilitary establishment was also in favor of an all-volunteer army, because it \nremoved the threat of genuinely mutinous draftees. Creating a professional \nwarrior class seemed like the obvious solution, but, looking back, we see now \nthat it created an isolated community that society at large could expend on \nendless wars. These were no longer our sons, our fathers, our friends. These \nwere distant superheroes we occasional saw in movies and airports. We might have\n told them \u201cthank you for your service,\u201d but what we really meant was \u201cbetter \nyou than me.\u201d And so we squandered them, threw them into one conflict after \nanother. Nearly two decades after 9/11, it was recorded that American personnel \nwere committed to at least seven major combat zones around the globe. Seven! Did\n any of us know that at the time? Would many of us have cared? When President \nDonald Trump told a grieving war widow that her husband \u201cknew what he was \ngetting into,\u201d wasn\u2019t he just voicing what we all felt? It\u2019s easy to see now how\n attractive privatization looked by the late 2020s. Recruitment was down. \nSuicide was up. It was even revealed that, thanks to our horrendous education \nand nutrition standards, 71 percent of all young Americans were unfit for \nmilitary service. So why not get rid of that service altogether? We\u2019d already \nbegun privatizing as early as the 1980s when President Reagan Ronald announced, \n\u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201d And \nthat philosophy only gained traction in the 1990s when President Bill Clinton \ndeclared, \u201cThe era of big government is over.\u201d By nationalizing narcissism, \nshould we have been surprised that all our major turn-of-the-century \nbreakthroughs had absolutely nothing to do with current events? Some geriatric \nGen X\u2019rs like me still remember that during the oil wars of the early 2000s, \nwhen America, the world, was screaming for an alternative to petroleum, all we \ngot was Steve Jobs crowing about watching \u201cThe Office\u201d on our phones. In our \nrush to cut taxes and maximize profits, it seems inevitable, now, that after \nprivatizing the Departments of Education, Agriculture and Corrections, the \nbehemoth of Defense was next. This was especially clear after President Miller\u2019s\n \u201cTwo Birds\u201d argument. After all, no more soldiers meant no more veterans, which\n meant no more Department of Veterans Affairs. It all sounded so attractive, \nfrom both a financial and emotional point of view. Instead of feeling \nresponsible for veterans, we could now outsource our guilt. We could finally \nhave it all. That was the feeling barely a quarter-century ago. No more \nobligation, no more providing for \u201cthe common defense.\u201d Now someone else could \ndo all the suffering to keep us happy and safe, and all we had to do was \u201cpray,\u201d\n \u201chug our children\u201d and \u201cparticipate in the economy.\u201d And we did. We shrunk our \nnational duty down to the size of a bumper sticker reading, \u201cI support our \ntroops\u201d or \u201cFreedom isn\u2019t Free.\u201d And look where it got us. And what can we do \nnow? It seems almost un-American to say this, but there simply is no quick fix. \nThere are short-term patches, no doubt, like giving our mercenaries what they \nwant. We don\u2019t have a choice. If we don\u2019t pay our sell-sword\u2019s ransom, they may \ndo a lot worse than simply drop those swords; they may turn them on us. We\u2019ve \nseen this happen in several countries over the last few years. In Venezuela, \nWest Congo and what used to (ironically) be known as the \u201cUnited\u201d Arab Emirates.\n In all those cases, hired guns decided it was more profitable to own the bank \nthan simply work for it. What\u2019s to stop that from happening here? And what\u2019s to \nstop our private contractors from simply switching sides? We saw it in 2019, \nwhen the Blackwater founder Erik Prince sold his warfighting expertise to China.\n We saw it in 2031 when China used its purchase of Bayer (which owned Monsanto, \nwhich owned the rights to almost all our corn and soybean seeds) to scare us \naway from Taiwan. For all we know, right now, our mercenary strike may very well\n be fueled by a Sino-Russian offer to buy Maniple right out from under us. And \nif that happens, our enemies won\u2019t have to defeat our armed forces. They\u2019ll \nlegally own them. Is this our new normal? Will every contract negotiation \nthreaten a strike, coup d\u2019\u00e9tat or betrayal to the highest bidder? Maybe. \nProbably. Unless we stop paying other people to protect us and start protecting \nourselves. Does that mean bringing back the draft? Of course not. Today\u2019s \nconflicts don\u2019t need legions of trigger-pulling grunts. They require highly \ntrained, highly specialized, highly professional warriors, but those warriors \nneed more than a bumper sticker for support. We need to bring back war bonds, \nand a war tax, and, possibly, some semblance of national service to give our \nchildren the muscle memory of being part of something greater than themselves. \nWe need to force our innovation sector to work on inventions that make our lives\n better, instead of just more comfortable. And if they have to earn just a \nsmidgen less profits to build those inventions here at home, so be it. If \nAmerica protects our corporations, then they should protect America. Lastly, we \nmust look at more than reruns of \u201cThe Office\u201d on our private screens. We have to\n learn about the world we live in and be able to tell the necessary conflicts \nfrom the convenient ones. The best way to prevent wars is to understand why they\n happen. This will lead to fewer wars and give us the assurance that if our \nfellow citizens are going to risk their lives for us, then they need to know, \nthat we know, that every other option has been exhausted. This might sound like \na revolution, but it will probably look more like an evolution. After all, it \ntook us a full century to dig the grave we\u2019re now in, and it may very well take \nanother century to climb out. But if we start today, as voters, taxpayers, \nneighbors and parents, we may just have a shot at saving tomorrow.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by You Can Vote. But You Can\u2019t Choose What Is True. \nElections are about finding compromise among people with vastly different \ndesires. By Yuval Noah Harari Prof. Harari is a historian, philosopher and \nauthor, most recently, of \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st Century.\u201d The 2020 election \nseason in the United States, which enters a new phase Monday, with the Iowa \nDemocratic caucuses, will probably be among the most divisive and contentious in\n American history. The results will reverberate around the world, and will most \nlikely shape the global order for years to come. As the political temperature \nrises to the boiling point, people on all sides should reflect on what \ndemocratic elections actually are. Elections are not a method for finding the \ntruth. They are a method for reaching peaceful compromise between the \nconflicting desires of different people. You might find yourself sharing a \ncountry with people who you consider ignorant, stupid and even malicious \u2014 and \nthey might think exactly the same of you. Still, do you want to reach a peaceful\n compromise with these people, or would you rather settle your disagreements \nwith guns and bombs? Since elections are a method for reaching a compromise \nabout our desires, in the polling stations people aren\u2019t asked \u201cWhat is the \ntruth?\u201d They are asked \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d That\u2019s why all citizens have equal \nvoting rights. When searching for the truth, the opinions of different people \ncarry different weights. But when it comes to desire, everybody should be \ntreated the same. In the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum, the eminent \nbiologist Richard Dawkins protested that the vast majority of the British public\n should never have been asked to vote in the referendum, because they lacked the\n necessary background in economics and political science. \u201cYou might as well \ncall a nationwide plebiscite to decide whether Einstein got his algebra right,\u201d \nMr. Dawkins wrote. Yet his analogy is flawed. Holding a plebiscite on whether to\n accept Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity is a ridiculous idea, because \nthat is a question of truth that should be left to experts. When discussing \nrelativity, the opinion of one physics professor counts for far more than the \nopinion of a thousand history professors or a thousand lawyers. But the question\n that appeared on the ballot in the 2016 referendum was not about truth. It was:\n \u201cShould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the \nEuropean Union?\u201d That\u2019s a question about desire, and there is no reason to \nprivilege the desires of experts over those of everyone else. You could argue \nthat desires are nevertheless formulated on the basis of facts, and that the \nBrexit debate hinged on proving or refuting certain economic theories. For \nexample, would leaving the European Union result in an increase or a decrease in\n Britain\u2019s gross domestic product? Most people are not equipped to answer such a\n complicated economic question. Therefore, you might conclude, Brexit really \nshould have been left to the experts. If G.D.P. was the only relevant \nconsideration, then Brexit should indeed have been decided by a small group of \nexperts. However, people may well have wished to leave the union for other \nreasons, even if such a step leads to economic disaster. In a democracy voters \nare perfectly entitled to prefer nationalist sentiments and religious ideals \nover economic interests. Experts might decry such preferences as \u201cirrational,\u201d \nbut allowing experts to dictate what people should want is the high road to \ntotalitarianism. There\u2019s a joke that a Communist activist once addressed a group\n of workers and promised them, \u201cWhen the revolution comes, you will all eat \nstrawberries and cream!\u201d A worker raised his hand and said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t like \nstrawberries and cream.\u201d The Communist immediately replied, in a slightly \nmenacing tone: \u201cWhen the revolution comes, you will like strawberries and \ncream.\u201d Outlawing the Truth Since elections are about desire rather than truth, \nexperts should not be given special voting rights. But for precisely the same \nreason, elected governments should respect the independence of science, the \ncourts and the media. Government represents the will of the majority of the \npeople, but the truth should not be subordinated to the will of the people, \nbecause people very often will the truth to be something other than it is. For \nexample, Christian fundamentalists very much desire the Scriptures to be true \nand the theory of evolution to be false. However, even if 90 percent of voters \nare Christian fundamentalists, they should not have the power to dictate \nscientific truth or to prevent scientists from exploring and publishing \ninconvenient truths. Unlike Congress, the department of biology should not \nreflect the will of the people. Congress can certainly pass a law declaring that\n the theory of evolution is wrong, but such a law does not change reality. \nSimilarly, when a charismatic leader is accused of corruption, his loyal \nsupporters usually wish these accusations to be false. But even if most voters \nsupport the leader, their desires should not prevent journalists and judges from\n investigating the accusations and getting to the truth. Even if a parliament \npasses a law declaring that all accusations against the leader are false, such a\n law does not change the facts. Of course, scientists, journalists and judges \nhave their own problems, and cannot always be trusted to discover and tell the \ntruth. Academic institutions, the media and the courts may be compromised by \ncorruption, bias or error. But subordinating them to a governmental Ministry of \nTruth is likely to make things worse. The government is already the most \npowerful institution in society, and it often has the greatest interest in \ndistorting or hiding inconvenient truths. Allowing the government to supervise \nthe search for truth is like appointing the fox to guard the chicken coop. To \nprotect the truth, it is better to rely on two other methods. First, academic \ninstitutions, the media and the judicial system have their own internal \nmechanisms for fighting corruption, correcting bias and exposing error. In \nacademia, peer-review publication is a far better check on error than \nsupervision by government officials, and academic promotion often depends on \nsuccessfully uncovering past mistakes and discovering unknown facts. In the \nmedia, free competition means that if one newspaper avoids publishing a scandal,\n its competitor is likely to jump at the scoop. In the judicial system, a judge \nthat takes bribes may be tried and punished just like any other citizen. Second,\n the existence of several independent institutions that seek the truth in \ndifferent ways allows these institutions to check and correct one another. For \nexample, if powerful corporations manage to break down the peer-review mechanism\n by bribing a large enough number of scientists, investigative journalists and \ncourts can expose and punish the perpetrators. If the media or the courts are \nafflicted by systematic racist biases, it is often the job of sociologists, \nhistorians and philosophers to expose these biases. None of these safety \nmechanisms are completely fail-proof, but no human institution is. Government \ncertainly isn\u2019t. There are of course other crucial reasons to protect the \nindependence of academic institutions, the media and in particular the courts. \nDemocratic elections are about human desire, and the one desire everyone shares \nis the desire to win. How then can we make sure that powerful political parties \ndon\u2019t rig the game in their favor? In a football game, it is obvious that the \nreferee cannot belong to one of the competing teams. When players argue whether \nthere was foul play or not, they need an independent arbitrator to settle the \nmatter. The same is true in a democracy. It too is a game with rules, and even a\n majority of voters should not be allowed to break these rules. For example, if \n51 percent of voters pass a law barring the other 49 percent from participating \nin future elections, some independent referee should call \u201cfoul!\u201d and strike \ndown that law \u2014 even though the majority of voters support it. In most \ndemocracies, that independent referee is a supreme court, and if the supreme \ncourt\u2019s independence is compromised, the democratic game turns into a majority \ndictatorship. Damn the Bears As an example, let\u2019s consider the crucial case of \nclimate change. The question \u201cDo human actions cause the earth\u2019s climate to \nwarm?\u201d is a question of truth. Lots of people wish the answer to this question \nto be \u201cno,\u201d but their desires don\u2019t change reality. So it would be ridiculous to\n put this question to a plebiscite in which all people enjoy equal voting \nrights. Instead, this question should be answered by the relevant experts. If \nmost climate experts answer \u201cyes,\u201d while most voters say \u201cno,\u201d we should believe\n the experts. The majority of voters should not have the power to stop academic \ndepartments and media outlets from studying and publishing undesirable truths. \nOf course, when it comes to making policy decisions about the climate crisis, in\n a democracy the will of the voters still reigns supreme. Acknowledging the \ntruth of climate change does not tell us what to do about it. We always have \noptions, and choosing between them is a question of desire. One option might be \nto immediately cut down greenhouse gas emissions, even at the cost of slowing \ndown economic growth. This means incurring some difficulties today but saving \npeople in 2050 from more severe hardship, saving Bangladesh from drowning, and \nsaving the polar bears from extinction. A second option might be to continue \nwith business as usual. This means having an easier life today, but making life \nharder for the next generation, flooding much of Bangladesh, and driving the \npolar bears \u2014 as well as numerous other species \u2014 to extinction. In choosing \nbetween these two options, the desires of experts should not override the \ndesires of other people. The one option that should not be on offer is hiding or\n distorting the truth. If we prefer to take it easier today, and damn the \nBangladeshis and the polar bears, we are entitled to vote for that in a \ndemocracy. But we are not entitled to pass a law stating that climate change is \na hoax. We can choose what we want, but we shouldn\u2019t deny the true meaning of \nour choice. Strawberries Rule Separating desire from truth is hardly a new idea.\n It has always been crucial for well-functioning democracies. But in the 21st \ncentury it is becoming more important than ever, because new technologies are \nmaking it easier to manipulate human desire. The combination of biotechnology \nwith information technology gives governments and corporations the ability to \nsystemically hack millions of people. We are very close to the point when some \ngovernments and corporations will know enough biology, gather enough data and \ncommand enough computing power to know us better than we know ourselves. With \nthe help of powerful new algorithms, governments and corporations will then be \nable not only to predict our choices, but to manipulate our desires and sell us \nanything they want \u2014 be it a product or a politician. When this revolution is \ncomplete, the algorithms could make sure not only that you will like \nstrawberries and cream, but that you also will like the ruling party. In a \ndemocracy, the government represents the will of the people. But what happens \nwhen the government has the power to systematically manipulate the will of the \npeople? Who then represents who? To make matters even worse, we are now seeing \nthe rise of populist regimes that first gain power by inciting hatred against \nforeigners and minorities, and then systematically attack any institution that \nmight limit their power. Their primary targets are exactly those institutions \nthat protect the truth: the media, the courts and the academy. Populist regimes \nfear the truth because it doesn\u2019t obey them, so they claim it doesn\u2019t exist. The\n typical populist leader flatters people by telling them that the only thing \nthat matters is their desires. Experts who point out inconvenient truths are \nrebranded as traitors who oppose the will of the people. To safeguard the future\n of democracy, we must keep truth independent of desire. It is not enough to \ndeclare loyalty to the abstract ideal of truth. The key is institutions. However\n imperfect, only institutions can turn ideals into social practices. No matter \nin which country you live, if you want to preserve democracy, vote for \npoliticians who respect the institutions that investigate and publish the truth.\n Vote for a party that tells people that they have the right to elect whatever \ngovernment they like, but they cannot elect whatever truth they like.
