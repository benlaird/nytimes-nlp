            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by I\u2019m Six Weeks Pregnant, and I\u2019m Telling the World \nAgainst the mandatory secret first trimester. By Betsy Cooper Ms. Cooper is the \ndirector of the Aspen Tech Policy Hub. For the past five years or so, I have \nbeen an interested observer of a vast unnamed secret club: a large number of \nwomen in their 30s who are pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, but don\u2019t want \nanyone to know. These women take a sudden interest in drinking \u201cgin and tonics\u201d \nat the bar, when everyone knows Manhattans are their drink. They have innovative\n new diets to announce in response to dinner party invitations (\u201cI\u2019m going vegan\n for January\u201d). They refuse to go on ski trips or bike rides, claiming an \nundefined illness. The cleverest among them even hide pomegranate juice in the \nrefrigerator \u2014 in the right glass, it\u2019s a dead ringer for a cabernet \u2014 and sneak\n to the kitchen for \u201cwine\u201d refills. A few days ago, I found out I am pregnant. \nThe apps tell me I am six weeks along (from my last period, the date doctors use\n to calculate how far along a pregnancy is). Yet, despite all the uncertainty, \nfear, and perhaps even backlash that may come my way for announcing this not \njust so early but also so publicly, I\u2019m declining membership in the hidden \npregnancy club once and for all. Most pregnancies today stay hidden at least \nthrough the first trimester, and sometimes beyond. The reasons vary widely. Some\n women keep their pregnancies a secret because they fear miscarriages or other \ncomplications, including nonviable pregnancies. These possibilities are real \u2014 \nroughly 10 percent to 20 percent of pregnancies end in miscarriage \u2014 and many \nwomen prefer to stay silent, rather than run the risk of sharing early, only to \nhave to share painful news later. Others fear career retaliation. New York Times\n reporting shows that discrimination against pregnant women is rampant. Women \nsneak to \u201cdentist\u201d appointments and \u201coff-site meetings,\u201d fearful that if they \ndisclose the real reason they need to leave work, they will be pulled from \nprojects or lose career advancement opportunities. After all, they will be \n\u201cleaving work soon\u201d on maternity leave anyway. (By contrast, of course, having \nchildren helps your career if you are a man.) Still others fear pregnancy \nitself: the changes to your body, the pain of childbirth and many of the side \neffects in between. Staying silent can be a coping mechanism to keep those fears\n at bay. Or women fear becoming defined by pregnancy. I certainly count myself \nin this category; I am a deeply ambitious professional woman, and I want people \nto know more about me than that my husband and I decided to have a child. Women \nmay even fear motherhood; after all, you are welcoming a stranger into your \nfamily whom you haven\u2019t even met yet. Will you even like your child? These fears\n are genuine. And for some (especially those expecting difficult pregnancies or \nstruggling to conceive) they can be debilitating. No one wants to talk about \ndifficult aspects of their lives time and time again. These fears are only \ncompounded by judgment that is likely to come a woman\u2019s way once the world knows\n she\u2019s expecting. Pregnancy (and for that matter, motherhood) has become a \nguilt-driven enterprise; women are made to second-guess any decision they make \nthat does not put their baby 100 percent first. Eat a piece of raw tuna while \nvisibly pregnant? The concerned looks will start coming. Strangers may even take\n matters into their own hands; waitstaff have refused to serve pregnant women \neven small amounts of wine. Pregnant women may end up feeling like the world \ncares more about their unborn children than about them. With all these \npressures, it has been lost that the trend toward secrecy in pregnancy has its \nown risks. Not least, women (and their partners) miss real, in-person \nopportunities to support one another through difficult times. Online anonymous \nmessage boards (and their fake or unscientific news) substitute for real \nconversations with friends and family members who had similar experiences. \nMoreover, we will get employers to take into account the real costs of pregnancy\n (not to mention the balancing act required between parenthood and work success)\n only if women start being public about the doctors\u2019 appointments, nausea, \nfatigue management and other difficult aspects of managing a healthy pregnancy \nwhile working. This is not an insignificant issue: 70 percent of mothers \nparticipate in the work force, and many women feel the worst during their first \ntrimester, precisely when they are also hiding their pregnancy. Perhaps most \nimportantly, we need to start pushing back against the stigma of miscarriages \nand nonviable pregnancies. These are very personal and very traumatic \nexperiences, yet they are also extremely common. If I land in that category \n(which, as a woman over 35, I am more likely to), I will be grateful for the \nsupport of others who came before me. Like many other decisions women make about\n their bodies, when and whether to go public with a pregnancy should be a \nchoice, not simply determined by social convention. So I am declaring myself \npregnant, in hopes of making other women who feel as I do comfortable going \npublic early as well. (I\u2019m feeling pretty good, by the way, thanks for asking!) \nIn doing so, I am fortunate that I run my own initiative so don\u2019t face the same \ncareer risks as many of my compatriots. But what I do face is a significant \nchange \u2014 in my body, in my career, in my life. A group of women with whom I can \nshare my fears, get advice, manage expectations? Now that\u2019s a club I\u2019m excited \nto join.  Betsy Cooper (@BetsonTech) is the director of the Aspen Institute\u2019s \nTech Policy Hub.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Women May Finally Be Declared Equal If the Virginia \nlegislature votes to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, it may become law. Video\n by Ken Burns transcript Women May Finally Be Declared Equal This is the \nTennessee House chamber on August 18, 1920. The room is full of roses, yellow \nworn by those supporting women\u2019s suffrage and red by those against. It\u2019s tense. \nAll eyes are on the clerk as he counts the votes. After decades of tireless \ncampaigning and 144 years after Thomas Jefferson declared all white, property-\nowning men equal, the battle for women\u2019s suffrage came down to a single vote, \ncast by the youngest member of the legislature, carrying a note from his mother.\n This vote ratified the 19th Amendment and guaranteed women the right to vote. \nIt\u2019s an incredible story and reminds us of how even constitutional amendments, \nso national in their scope, ultimately get decided on a very local, human level.\n It brings politics home. We have one of the world\u2019s oldest and shortest \nConstitutions. And its authors recognized the need for it to evolve with time. \nThe process is undoubtedly arduous. It took 203 years to pass the 27th \nAmendment, which revised congressional pay. But it allows we, the people, to \ndetermine the law. In 1923, three years after the 19th Amendment was ratified, \nsuffragist Alice Paul proposed a new amendment, one that would declare men and \nwomen equal under the law, not just at the polls. It became known as the Equal \nRights Amendment, the E.R.A. Today, nearly 100 years later, its passage still \nhangs in the balance. This year, as we approach the 100th anniversary of the \n19th Amendment\u2019s ratification, the E.R.A. will be a subject of local debate as \nsupporters will work to get the 38th and final state to ratify. Eyes will be on \nseveral of the state legislatures who have yet to ratify, including Virginia, \nNorth Carolina and Arizona. Its history is fascinating. After it was proposed in\n 1923, the E.R.A. was presented in every session of Congress for nearly 50 \nyears. In 1940, the Republican Party was the first to include support for the \namendment in its platform. When Congress eventually passed the E.R.A. in 1972, \nit went to the states for ratification. It was quickly approved by 33 states. \nBut the opposition, led by a woman, ran a campaign so strong the amendment was \nstill three states short by the deadline. \u201cBy coming here today, you have shown \nthat that is not what American women want.\u201d In recent years, galvanized by the \n#MeToo movement and the ratification of the 200-year-old 27th Amendment, \nsupporters have pushed for ratification from three remaining states, hoping \nCongress will adjust the deadline. In 2017, Nevada voted to ratify, followed a \nyear later by Illinois. History is being made. And it\u2019s happening right in our \nbackyards. And that\u2019s why I want to show you this moment, from 1920, in the \nTennessee House chamber, when the 19th Amendment hung in the balance. \u201cThe \nSuffragists needed one more vote. And as the fateful roll call began, they had \nno idea where it might come from. Harry Burn, from McMinn County, the youngest \nman in the legislature, was cautious. Most of his constituents were against \nvotes for women. And he had come into the chamber that morning with a red rose \nin his buttonhole. But he also carried, folded in his pocket, a letter from his \nmother.\u201d \u201cDear son, vote for suffrage and don\u2019t keep them in doubt. I noticed \nsome of the speeches against. They were very bitter. I have been watching to see\n how you stood but have not seen anything yet. Don\u2019t forget to be a good boy. \nWith lots of love, mama.\u201d \u201cWhen the roll call reached him, Harry Burn voted to \nratify. His single vote ended 72 years of painful struggle. The 19th Amendment \nwas now law. Women\u2019s suffrage had, at last, been written into the Constitution. \nAnd the goal that had first been proposed in Seneca Falls in 1848 had been \nreached. Asked to explain himself later, Harry Burn said simply, I know that a \nmother\u2019s advice is always safest for a boy to follow.\u201d I love that story on so \nmany levels. It\u2019s one of the great single deciding votes in our history. And it \nwas cast by a 24-year-old who changed his mind on the spot thanks to a letter \nfrom his mother. It\u2019s an interesting echo to the process we\u2019re seeing unfold \naround the renewed efforts to pass the E.R.A. You know, the most recent vote to \nconsider the E.R.A. was in Virginia in February 2019. Guess how many votes it \nfell short by? Harnessing the power of its new Democratic majority, the Virginia\n legislature is poised to vote this week to become the 38th of the 38 states \nneeded to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would make women\u2019s rights \nexplicit in the Constitution. In the video Op-Ed above, the filmmaker Ken Burns \ncompares this historic moment with the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which\n granted women the right to vote 100 years ago. Ken Burns (@KenBurns) has been \nmaking films about American history for nearly 40 years. This video was produced\n by UNUM, his new initiative exploring the intersection of history and current \nevents.

His business model was to \ngo to Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq and recruit Arab Shiites to kill Arab \nSunnis (and Americans and Israelis) and to create pro-Iranian statelets inside \nIran\u2019s Arab neighbors to weaken them from the inside. I followed this man \nclosely. No one should mourn his passing. So why do I still question the wisdom \nof his assassination? Because it was done without a clear strategic or moral \nframework. And the biggest lesson I learned from covering the U.S. interventions\n in Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan is: When administrations are not constantly \nforced to answer hard questions from the outside about what they\u2019re thinking \nstrategically and morally \u2014 when questioners are dismissed as unpatriotic \u2014 that\n administrations\u2019 inside thinking gets sloppy, their intelligence gets \nmanipulated and trouble follows. Never assume that people who are in charge know\n what they are doing just because they are in charge.  What is President Trump\u2019s\n strategic framework? One day, without any consultation with allies or our \ncommanders, he ordered U.S. troops out of Syria, where they were serving as a \ncritical block on Iran\u2019s ability to build a land bridge to Lebanon and were a \nkey source of intelligence. In the process, he abandoned our most important \nallies in fighting ISIS: the Syrian Kurds, who were also creating an island of \ndecency in their region, where islands of decency are the most we can hope for. \nAnd then, a few weeks later, Trump ordered the killing of Suleimani, an action \nthat required him to shift more troops into the region and tell Iraqis that \nwe\u2019re not leaving their territory, even though their Parliament voted to evict \nus. It also prompted Iran to restart its nuclear weapons program, which could \nwell necessitate U.S. military action.  But it also may have set in motion \nforces of popular discontent in Iran that will further delegitimize the regime \u2014\n a good thing. So what\u2019s our priority: take advantage of Iran\u2019s weakened regime \nto secure a better nuclear deal or urge its people to topple it? And how will we\n react if the regime mows down Iranians we\u2019ve encouraged to rise? Not clear at \nall. But Trump also has no moral framework. He ordered the killing of Suleimani \n\u2014 a depraved Iranian warrior \u2014 just a few weeks after he gave a moral pass to a \ndepraved U.S. warrior.  How so? Guess who the Trumps had over to Mar-a-Lago \nduring the Christmas holidays \u2014 and who they didn\u2019t invite? They welcomed Navy \nSEAL Edward Gallagher and his wife. During the summer, Gallagher was tried in a \nmilitary court on war crimes. A member of his platoon told investigators, \u201cYou \ncould tell he was perfectly O.K. with killing anybody that was moving.\u201d  That \nassessment was published by The Times a few days after the Trumps warmly \nreceived the Gallaghers. It was part of a trove of leaked combat video, text \nmessages and confidential interviews with members of SEAL Team 7 that revealed \nin chilling detail why Gallagher, their platoon commander, had been on trial for\n his actions in Iraq. Here is how The Times once described some of Gallagher\u2019s \nmilitary exploits in 2017: His unit had captured and wounded a young ISIS \nfighter \u2014 \u201ca scraggly teenager in a tank top with limbs so thin that his watch \nslid easily off his wrist.\u201d They sedated him and performed an emergency \nprocedure to help him breathe.  \u201cThen, without warning, according to colleagues,\n Chief Gallagher pulled a small hunting knife from a sheath and stabbed the \nsedated captive in the neck.\u201d Gallagher \u201clater posed for a photograph holding \nthe dead captive up by the hair\u201d and shared the deer-kill photo with others.  \nGallagher was eventually turned in for this and other incidents by his fellow \nSEALs. He was charged with 10 offenses under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice. Weeks after Gallagher stabbed the ISIS captive, according to an \nAssociated Press report in June from his trial, two SEALs testified that he \n\u201cgunned down a young girl and an old man in Iraq in 2017 from his sniper\u2019s \nperch, though neither witnessed him pulling the trigger. The SEALs said shots \ncame from the tower where Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher was posted \nand they watched through their scopes as the civilians fell to the ground. \n\u201cDalton Tolbert,\u201d The A.P. continued, \u201csaid he and another sniper were in a \nneighboring tower in Mosul, on June 18, 2017, and had fired warning shots to \nscatter civilians by the Tigris River because the Islamic State was operating in\n the area. An old man in a white tunic began running and then Tolbert heard a \nthird shot come from the neighboring tower where Gallagher was positioned and \nsaw the man fall. Over the radio, he heard Gallagher say: \u2018You guys missed him, \nbut I got him.\u2019\u201d The article also reported: \u201cAnother witness, Joshua Vriens, \nsaid on another day that he saw Gallagher shoot at a group of adolescent girls \nin floral hijabs, hitting one in the stomach and sending two scattering. Vriens \nsaid he watched through his scope as a fourth girl dragged the wounded girl over\n a berm and under a bridge to escape.\u201d Gallagher\u2019s defense got him acquitted \nbecause no witness reported seeing him actually pull the trigger in those \nincidents and because, as The Times reported, a medic testified that he watched \nGallagher stab the prisoner in the neck, \u201cbut that the stab wound did not appear\n to be life-threatening\u201d and that afterward the medic pressed his thumb over the\n captive\u2019s breathing tube until he died.  Furious Navy prosecutors said the \nmedic never suggested in six interviews that he had suffocated the captive. \n\u201cThey said he changed his story after receiving the grant of immunity,\u201d The \nTimes wrote. The Navy still demoted Gallagher for posing with the dead captive. \nThat was until some Gallagher pals and Fox News got Trump to reverse the \npunishment, restore his rank \u2014 and block the Navy from upholding its moral code \nby stripping Gallagher of his Trident pin, signifying his membership in the \nelite SEALs. For Trump, the idea that in war or diplomacy there would be an \nethical code that we\u2019d impose on ourselves is an utterly alien concept. Trump \nhas never lived by any code in any context \u2014 not in real estate and not as \npresident.  Codes are for suckers and sissies in Trump\u2019s view. He thinks that \nwhat makes American soldiers great is that they\u2019re killers. And his view is let \nkillers be killers. And anyway, for Trump, if an Iraqi girl wearing a hijab got \nshot by accident, who cares, they\u2019re all scum anyway. As Andrew Sullivan put it \nin an essay on this subject in New York magazine last week: \u201cA president who \nbelieves a war criminal is among the finest fighters the U.S. has and suggests \nhe will pardon him after his trial is, quite simply, unique in the history of \nthe U.S.\u201d But Gallagher\u2019s SEAL teammates, by calling him out, said that what \nmakes our military unique and respected is that we operate by a code and that \ncode operates even in the most heated of firefights. That code is our moral \nframework under pressure, and by holding each other to it we keep our unit and \nour country strong. That\u2019s why they blew the whistle. But Trump hates whistle-\nblowers who take seriously their oath to defend the Constitution. That\u2019s why the\n same president who invited the cowardly Gallagher and his wife to Mar-a-Lago \u2014 \nnot the heroic SEALs who had the courage and integrity to step forward to defend\n their code, our code \u2014 was the same president who used the cowardly Rudy \nGiuliani to secretly push out the high-integrity U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who\n had the courage to defend our code in diplomacy and try to prevent the spread \nof corruption in Kyiv. Why does it all matter, you ask? Ask the family of the \nnext American soldier captured by terrorists after his captors declare, \u201cWe\u2019re \ngoing to do to your soldier just what Trump excused Gallagher for doing to one \nof ours.\u201d The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the \neditor.

            "full_text": "Advertisement Supported by Warren and Klobuchar Teach the Boys a Lesson At the \nDemocratic debate, gender comes to the fore. By Frank Bruni Opinion Columnist \nWould a female Democratic nominee have a harder time beating Donald Trump than a\n male one? I can\u2019t tell you, because I don\u2019t have a crystal ball and because \nit\u2019s a stupid question, its answer dependent on which female candidate you\u2019re \ntalking about, on how she runs her campaign, on the twists and turns of the \nnational conversation between now and November. But I can tell you this: Either \nof the two women among the six candidates on the stage in Des Moines on Tuesday \nnight would give Trump a serious run for his money. Both have earned the right \nto take him on. Both would be formidable presidents. And both made clear, with \ncommanding performances, how absurd it is that this country hasn\u2019t yet shattered\n the highest glass ceiling of all. I\u2019m focusing on Elizabeth Warren and Amy \nKlobuchar because during the most electric stretch of this seventh debate of the\n Democratic primary, the focus was indeed on them \u2014 or, rather, on the idea that\n their party couldn\u2019t risk nominating one of them at a juncture when getting rid\n of a Republican incumbent has seldom, if ever, been so important. You know the \nback story. According to media reports over recent days, Warren and Bernie \nSanders met 13 months ago to discuss their nascent presidential campaigns and he\n told her he didn\u2019t believe a woman could win the 2020 election. Sanders denies \nsaying that. He denied it again on Tuesday night, and Warren declined to get \ninto a back-and-forth about that conversation. What she did instead was more \neffective \u2014 and certainly more stirring: She drew a contrast between the two \nwomen and the four men who had made the cut for this debate, which was the final\n one before the Iowa caucuses and had the fewest candidates so far. That \ncontrast was perfect, and got better still when Klobuchar chimed in, because \nwhat the two women said brilliantly cast them not as trailblazers who had \nsomething extra to prove, not as outsiders who had finagled a way in, not as \nunderdogs urging voters to take some extraordinary leap of faith, not as high-\nminded gambles. They turned the stubborn, sexist notion that their presence and \npresidential ambitions were exotic on its head, citing yardsticks by which they \nwere demonstrably superior to their male rivals. \u201cI think the best way to talk \nabout who can win is by looking at people\u2019s winning record,\u201d Warren, a second-\nterm senator from Massachusetts, said. \u201cLook at the men on this stage. \nCollectively, they have lost 10 elections.\u201d She didn\u2019t name the men or the \nelections, but Joe Biden is the veteran of two previous, miserably unsuccessful \ncampaigns for the presidency. Pete Buttigieg lost bids to become the treasurer \nof Indiana and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. In contrast, \nWarren noted, \u201cThe only people on this stage who have won every single election \nthat they\u2019ve been in are the women \u2014 Amy and me. And the only person who has \nbeaten an incumbent Republican any time in the past 30 years is me.\u201d Klobuchar, \na third-term senator from Minnesota, said you don\u2019t need to be male to win just \nas you don\u2019t need other qualities pronounced necessary or optimal by some \nunnamed, amorphous committee of pronouncers. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be the skinniest\n person in the room,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be the loudest person. You \nhave to be competent.\u201d \u201cAnd when you look at what I have done,\u201d she added, \u201cI \nhave won every race, every place, every time. I have won in the reddest of \ndistricts. I have won in the suburban areas, in the rural areas.\u201d That, she \nadded, was why she had \u201cthe most endorsements of current Iowa legislators and \nformer Iowa legislators in this race.\u201d  I don\u2019t mean to romanticize Warren and \nKlobuchar. Warren\u2019s boast about vanquishing a Republican incumbent? That \nincumbent was Scott Brown, whose victory in a special election in deep blue \nMassachusetts was considered something of a freak occurrence to begin with. And \nwhen Klobuchar began to tick off the names of women recently elected to high \nposts, she suddenly froze, unable to remember who the governor of Kansas was, \nthough she\u2019d just said, \u201cI\u2019m very proud to know her.\u201d (Her name is Laura Kelly.)\n I\u2019m also not saying that Warren or Klobuchar would be the party\u2019s best bet. I \ndon\u2019t know who would be. I\u2019m just saying that on a night when the viability of \nwomen aiming for the White House went from subtext to text, these two women \nfound words \u2014 not just in addressing that issue but also in talking about \nprescription-drug prices, climate change, nuclear weapons and more \u2014 that \nexposed the bigotry and shamefulness of doubts about female candidates. \nOtherwise the seventh debate was sleepily like many of the first six: Biden \nseemed to be campaigning for a third Barack Obama term, and his sentences were \nless straight lines than knots. They didn\u2019t build toward a conclusion so much as\n sag until they finally gave out. Warren said \u201ccorruption\u201d every chance she got.\n Sanders called for revolution and correctly emphasized that many trade and \nforeign-policy positions that other Democrats came around to he embraced from \nthe start. Buttigieg pivoted from the question at hand to a practiced soliloquy \nthat almost always had something to do with turning the page and a new \ngeneration. Tom Steyer insisted that no one cared about the environment as much \nas he did. And Klobuchar talked about so many different pieces of legislation \nwith her name on them that you had this image of her racing around the Capitol \nwith an outstretched pen, stopping all aides who passed by and scrawling her \nsignature on any paper they were carrying. One new wrinkle was Warren\u2019s clear \nand proud positioning of herself to Sanders\u2019s right on trade and on health care.\n She was making the case for herself as a progressive who would favor \nincremental fixes if those were the only available improvements and who could be\n a unifier; she suggested that Sanders lacked that potential. Buttigieg, \nmeanwhile, was more determined than ever to mention and reach out to voters of \ncolor, from whom he enjoys little support. But what most distinguished the \ndebate was the way in which gender came to the fore. There was a memorable \nmoment when Sanders sought to correct Warren on her 30-year claim, noting that \nhe\u2019d defeated a Republican in 1990, and she did some quick, out-loud arithmetic \nto determine that 1990 was, well, 30 years ago! Mansplaining met mathematics.  \nWarren also said this: \u201cSince Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have \noutperformed men candidates in competitive races. And in 2018, we took back the \nHouse; we took back statehouses, because of women candidates and women voters.\u201d \n\u201cBack in the 1960s,\u201d she added, \u201cpeople asked, \u2018Could a Catholic win?\u2019 Back in \n2008, people asked if an African-American could win. In both times the \nDemocratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate and we \nchanged America. That\u2019s who we are.\u201d It was a self-serving edit of history, \nsure, and it put the most positive gloss possible on the nation\u2019s character. But\n that didn\u2019t make it any less important. Or any less inspiring. I invite you to \nsign up for my free weekly email newsletter. You can follow me on Twitter \n(@FrankBruni).
